Wayne Rooney says Manchester United must now focus on the FA Cup final Wayne Rooney says Manchester United must now focus on the FA Cup final On Tuesday, man of the match Wayne Rooney gave United the lead with his 100th Premier League goal at Old Trafford, finishing off a superb team move from 12 yards. Marcus Rashford doubled it with 15 minutes remaining, sliding home on the half-volley with a fine finish into the bottom corner after Antonio Valencia's lay-off.

The result means United finish the season in fifth and qualify for the Europa League group stage, starting in September, while Southampton drop down to sixth and could have to play in the Europa League third qualifying round, starting on July 28. Louis van Gaal received a mixed reception when he addressed the crowd Louis van Gaal received a mixed reception when he addressed the crowd Bournemouth finish 16th in their first-ever season in the English top flight. Louis van Gaal picked the same side that was due to play on Sunday, despite the upcoming FA Cup final against Crystal Palace on Saturday, while the visitors made just one change as Dan Gosling came in for Harry Arter. Not everyone decided to make the trip again for the final fixture of the 2015/16 Premier League season, with plenty of empty seats scattered around Old Trafford. Anthony Martial looks to take the ball away from Bournemouth in the first half The fans who did were not treated to much entertainment in the first half as both sides struggled to create any openings until late on, with Marc Pugh seeing his shot from Matt Ritchie's cut-back blocked superbly by Cameron Borthwick-Jackson. United took the lead on the stroke of half-time after a fine team move, instigated by Anthony Martial's confident run into the area. After playing a one-two with Juan Mata, the Frenchman's ball across the box was dummied by Rashford, allowing Rooney to slot the ball home from 10 yards. Rooney was in fine form for United The game came to life in the second half as Michael Carrick's deflected effort hit the bar just before the hour-mark, while Mata's effort was blocked by the face of Lewis Cook shortly after. Adam Federici tipped over an audacious long-range effort from Valencia as United piled on the pressure, and it was 2-0 in the 75th minute through Rashford. His eighth goal in a United shirt came from Valencia's deft touch in the area after Rooney had found him at the back post, allowing the 18-year-old to slot into the far bottom corner with superb technique from 15 yards. Marcus Rashford celebrates his goal in the second half Young added a third just minutes after coming on, squirming the ball under Federici after Rooney's ball over the top of the Bournemouth defence, before Benik Afobe's effort was turned into the bottom corner of his own goal by Smalling in stoppage time. There were boos after full-time as Van Gaal addressed the Old Trafford crowd to thank them for their \"unconditional support\" this season, but the Dutchman has the chance of bringing silverware home on Saturday when United face Crystal Palace in the FA Cup final.

hat-trick at the Emirates Stadium. The Gunners, who started the day two points behind Spurs, needed a favour from Newcastle and Rafael Benitez's side duly obliged, beating Mauricio Pochettino's side 5-1 at St James' Park. Arsenal, who welcomed back Jack Wilshere and Santi Cazorla to the starting line-up, had a job of their own to do and they were sent on their way thanks to Giroud's powerful header in the fifth minute. As the game wore on and the score from Newcastle echoed around the stadium, nerves began to set in for the hosts but they were well and truly put to bed as Giroud completed his hat-trick with two goals in two minutes (78, 80).

Jack Wilshere made his first Premier League start since the final day of last season Arsenal were on the front foot from the start and they were ahead in the fifth minute after Alexis Sanchez's back-heel released Nacho Monreal down the left flank.

The hosts continued to press forward as Sanchez shot wide and the loudest cheer of the half came when news of a Newcastle goal against Tottenham filtered through to the Arsenal supporters. England manager Roy Hodgson was at the Emirates to watch Wilshere in action The home fans found their voice again, roaring their team on and Wilshere should have scored when picked out at the far post by Sanchez, but the 24-year-old could only hit the side-netting from six yards. They were almost made to pay as Scott Sinclair was allowed to get a shot away in the penalty area, but the ball dribbled wide of Petr Cech's far-post and Jordan Lyden's cutback was intercepted by Monreal. Arsenal continued to dominate possession in the second-half but they could not find their cutting edge in front of goal.

Arsenal had their third two minutes later when Giroud beat Bunn after collecting Hector Bellerin's pass, while the scoring was rounded off in injury-time after Arteta's shot bounced off the crossbar, onto Bunn and into the back of the net. Arteta, playing his final Arsenal game, shows his emotion as supporters applaud at the final whistle By this time the celebrations were in full flow in the stands as news of the Spurs result came through, but there was still a sense of what might have been for the Gunners, who finished the season 10 points behind champions Leicester.

James McCarthy's outstanding strike gave the hosts the lead after 19 minutes before Leighton Baines doubled his side's lead from the spot shortly before half time after Robbie Brady was adjudged to have fouled Romelu Lukaku. Kevin Mirallas wrapped up the three points almost immediately after the break as Tim Howard celebrated his final Everton appearance with his 133rd clean sheet for the club.

Gareth Barry jumps over the challenge of Gary O'Neil In contrast, it was another disappointing afternoon for Norwich, whose relegation had been confirmed in midweek after Sunderland's win over Everton, as they failed to trouble the home side. Joe Royle and David Unsworth took charge of first-team affairs after Martinez left the club during the week and their four changes brought renewed energy to an Everton side which has struggled in recent matches. An emotional Tim Howard says goodbye to the Everton fans and staff after a decade at the club. An emotional Tim Howard says goodbye to the Everton fans and staff after a decade at the club. There were full debuts for youngsters Tom Davies and Kieran Dowell, with the pair contributing to an exciting and vibrant Toffees midfield, while Phil Jagielka's timely return came a day before England manager Roy Hodgson announced his squad for Euro 2016. David Unsworth (R) and Joe Royle (L) took charge of Everton's victory over Norwich The hosts started with pace and enthusiasm, chasing down every ball all over the pitch and were nearly rewarded early on but Lukaku's volley was gathered by John Ruddy. The goalkeeper was then called into action to deny the Belgium international soon afterwards with a superb double save. Gareth Barry did well to win the ball back for Everton in midfield, teeing up Lukaku and his low curling effort was beaten away by Ruddy, who was up quickly to deny the striker again from the edge of the box. Leighton Baines penalty goal, Everton v Norwich City, Premier League Everton did then take a deserved lead and it all started from the back with Howard quickly releasing the ball before Dowell embarked on a good run at the Norwich defence. The ball ran away from the youngster but rolled into the path of McCarthy who lashed it first time into the top corner. Davis and Dowell were at the heart of a lot of Everton's good play, and there was also an appearance for another academy graduate with Jonjoe Kenny replacing Matthew Pennington in the first half because of injury. Nathan Redmond had half chances for the away side but he could not find the target from distance, with Mirallas then screwing an effort into the side netting. Leighton Baines of Everton celebrates scoring his team's second goal against Norwich Norwich could have equalised shortly afterwards when Cameron Jerome did well to lay off Matt Jarvis but he got his effort all wrong, blasting over from the edge of the box. Everton went into the interval two goals ahead, however, when referee Lee Mason pointed to the spot after Robbie Brady tugged Lukaku's arm in the box, sending the striker to the ground. Baines stepped up to casually plant the ball into the net with his left foot, sending Ruddy the wrong way. Kevin Mirallas of Everton scores his team's third goal against Norwich The hosts made sure of the points three minutes after the re-start when McCarthy's pass picked out the run of the overlapping Kenny and his cutback wriggled through to Mirallas at the back post who tapped the ball into the net. Howard was called into action properly for the first time after the hour mark to deny Brady's effort at the near post, which the American beat away with his legs before Jerome went close, but he could not keep his header under the bar. Tim Howard enjoyed a guard of honour after the game Ross Barkley was then introduced, replacing the excellent Dowall after 70 minutes, and he immediately bulldozed his way through the Norwich defence but his shot was well held by Ruddy. Norwich forced corners at the end of the game but they were all dealt with manfully by the Everton defence as Howard kept his final clean sheet for the club before waving goodbye to the Goodison Park crowd at the end of the game. Soccer Saturday verdict - Charlie Nicholas \"They [Everton] introduced two kids today, Tom Davies and Kieran Dowell, and they were excellent. Very comfortable on the ball, quite elegant players with a good work ethic. They closed the ball down and were fabulous to watch today. \"Then Matthew Pennington went off with a hamstring problem and another young full-back, Jonjoe Kenny came on. It was quite a young side, quite refreshing. \"But this was a stroll in the park, Norwich looked like they wanted the day over and Everton were grateful for that kind of situation. \"Norwich's defenders have done what they have for most of the season. They don't get tight enough, they don't get aggressive enough when it matters and they let Romelu Lukaku turn at them every time today. Defensively it wasn't very impressive again.\" Player ratings: Everton: Howard (7), Baines (7), Stones (6), Jagielka (7), Pennington (4), McCarthy (7), Barry (7), Davies (7), Lukaku (7), Mirallas (7),

10 men to leave Spurs third in the Premier League, behind rivals Arsenal. Georginio Wijnaldum put Newcastle ahead on 19 minutes from inside the area, before Aleksandar Mitrovic's fine header doubled their lead before half-time. Erik Lamela halved the deficit from a tight angle just after the hour mark, and Newcastle were reduced to 10 men after Mitrovic dragged his boot down Kyle Walker's shin with a quarter of the game remaining. Rafael Benitez's name was sung all afternoon at St James' Park But shortly after the red card Newcastle were awarded a controversial penalty after Moussa Sissoko went down in the area from Christian Eriksen's challenge, and Wijnaldum converted for his second and the hosts' third. Spurs then capitulated at St James' Park, allowing the 10 men of Newcastle to score two more goals on the break through Rolando Aarons and then Daryl Janmaat. The result means Arsenal, who beat Aston Villa 4-0, have finished above Tottenham for a 21st straight season in the Premier League. Spurs made just one change from the side that lost 2-1 against Southampton last weekend, while Newcastle made three after their 0-0 draw with Aston Villa. Wijnaldum is put under pressure by Kyle Walker Manager Rafa Benitez's name was sung by the home fans throughout the game, with the Spaniard due to make a decision on his future at the club in the next two weeks. Benitez's side were relegated in midweek following Sunderland's win over Everton, and they started like a side without pressure on their shoulders. Mitrovic came within inches of getting on the end of Janmaat's low cross from the right after 10 minutes, but moments later they were ahead. After Toby Alderweireld's poor cleared header fell to the feet of Sissoko, the midfielder's centre allowed Mitrovic to lay the ball off for Wijnaldum to slide into the bottom right corner from 12 yards. Aleksandar Mitrovic also scored, but was sent off in the second half And 20 minutes later Mitrovic turned scorer to make it 2-0, heading home Sissoko's fine right-wing cross from 12 yards after Spurs had allowed Newcastle too much time on the ball out wide. Tottenham's first real chance fell to Eriksen at an acute angle after being found by Harry Kane, but the Denmark international's effort was saved well by Karl Darlow at his near post. Lamela made it 2-1 on 61 minutes from an acute angle on the left after being found by Eric Dier, his left-footed effort somehow finding its way past Karl Darlow in the Newcastle goal at the near post. Mauricio Pochettino apologised to the Tottenham fans feels his squad needs to improve mentally Mauricio Pochettino apologised to the Tottenham fans feels his squad needs to improve mentally The momentum then swung Spurs' way further as Mitrovic was sent off for a nasty scrape down Walker's shin at the touchline, but the visitors failed to take advantage. Referee Anthony Taylor awarded Newcastle a penalty with 17 minutes remaining after Sissoko went down under the challenge of Eriksen, but replays showed the midfielder was toppled too easily. Wijnaldum stepped up to send Hugo Lloris the wrong way for 3-1, and with Arsenal comfortably beating Aston Villa, Spurs' hopes of finishing above their rivals were fading. Sissoko, who was magnificent on the day, then forced a fine save from Lloris from range, before the French goalkeeper denied Andros Townsend down low to his left. Matt Le Tissier looks back on Newcastle's 5-1 demolition of Tottenham in the Premier League Matt Le Tissier looks back on Newcastle's 5-1 demolition of Tottenham in the Premier League Lloris was at it again late on, denying Sissoko one-on-one as Spurs piled forward and left just two defenders back, but Newcastle wrapped it up through Aarons' fine half-volley into the far corner at the left of the area after Townsend had hit the woodwork. There was enough time for defender Janmaat to make it 5-1 a minute later, finding the bottom left corner on the break as Lloris positioned himself questionably towards his near post, and that's how it stayed as St James' Park urged Benitez to continue his work with the club into the Championship. A fine season ended on a sour note for Spurs, though Kane, starved of chances on Sunday, will end the season as Premier League top scorer with 25 goals.

Sadio Mane scored the breakthrough goal A cross from the left by Dusan Tadic was not properly cleared by Palace's defence and with the ball flying high up in the air, Speroni, who was making his 388th appearance to equal the goalkeeper club record set by John Jackson, flapped at the attempt. The ball eventually came out to Mane who was able to chip the goalkeeper and score the game's first goal. Just a minute later, Crystal Palace had their best chance of the first half as Gayle had a chance to score from just a few yards out but he hit his effort straight at Forster. In the second half, the game increased greatly in tempo with attacking changes made by both managers with Pelle and Sullay Kaikai coming on. For Kaikai, who has spent most of the season on loan at Shrewsbury, it was his Premier League debut. Pelle celebrated Southampton's second goal by celebrating with Kelvin Davis And the 20-year-old Palace winger came close to finding an equaliser as his scuffed shot was well palmed away by Forster in the 60th minute. A minute later, Southampton doubled their lead when Pelle scored a characteristic header after a cross from Cuco Martina towards the far post. Speroni attempted to palm the ball away, but the power was too much as the Italy international then went off to celebrate with the club's longest-serving captain Kelvin Davis. Jason Puncheon made it 2-1 just three minutes after Pelle doubled the Saints' lead Then just two minutes later, Puncheon found a consolation. A corner punched away by Forster landed at the feet of the winger who cut the ball onto his left foot before rifling the ball high into the top-left corner. Sadio Mane won Southampton a penalty after being brought down by Pape Souare and Adrian Mariappa Southampton scored again in the 75th minute as Mane, who was a live-wire all afternoon, went down in the penalty box after being sandwiched by Pape Souare and Adrian Mariappa. Bertrand stepped up to take the penalty and converted it into the top-left corner. Palace tried to respond through a blocked Mile Jedinak shot and a Puncheon cross which went agonisingly wide of the post, before Southampton made it 4-1. Davis met a ball chested down by Pelle in the penalty box to score his first home goal in over six months. Southampton can celebrate securing Europa League football And despite Gayle nodding a header wide in the 89th minute, it was Southampton who finished the game with a comfortable win, and they can now look forward to Europa League football next season.

"Mame Biram Diouf rises at the near post to head home the winner at the Britannia West Ham must rely on a favour from Man Utd to qualify for the Europa League after they were beaten 2-1 by Stoke at the Britannia Stadium on Sunday afternoon. Michail Antonio put the visitors in front with a low finish on 23 minutes but they were pegged back by Giannelli Imbula's strike shortly after half-time. The Hammers squandered several opportunities to restore their lead and were floored by Mame Biram Diouf's 88th-minute header as Stoke earned their first win since March 19. Mame Biram Diouf celebrates his late header After a fantastic season West Ham started the day with hopes of a fifth-place finish, but defeat leaves them seventh in the table and they will only secure a Europa League spot if United beat Crystal Palace in the FA Cup final. As for the hosts, the final-day victory secures a top-half finish for Mark Hughes' side, who end the campaign ninth. Bilic made one change from the dramatic win over Man United, replacing the injured Dimitri Payet with James Tomkins. West Ham's 2-1 loss at Stoke is a very difficult result to take, says Slaven Bilic West Ham's 2-1 loss at Stoke is a very difficult result to take, says Slaven Bilic The reshuffle allowed Antonio to move further forward and he opened the scoring after 23 minutes, latching on to Winston Reid's knock-down from a corner to turn and fire past Shay Given. Stoke failed to muster a shot on target in a disappointing first half, and the visitors had further chances to extend their advantage before the break. Stoke manager Mark Hughes says his side started brightly in their 2-1 win against West Ham Stoke manager Mark Hughes says his side started brightly in their 2-1 win against West Ham Diafra Sakho dragged an effort past the near post after good work from the lively Antonio, before Sakho slipped at the crucial moment after holding off the challenge of Philipp Wollscheid. The wasteful finishing continued with Andy Carroll and Sakho guilty either side of the interval, and Stoke made them pay when Imbula drilled home the equaliser after 55 minutes. Michail Antonio opened the scoring for West Ham in the first half The Stoke midfielder was allowed onto his stronger left foot and arrowed a firm shot past Darren Randolph in the West Ham goal. Despite the setback, Bilic's side looked more likely to grab a winner and the game became stretched in the final stages. Enner Valencia headed over from four yards and Emmanuel Emenike and Antonio were both denied by Given in quick succession. The amount of chances West Ham had during their 2-1 defeat to Stoke was unbelievable, says Mark Noble The amount of chances West Ham had during their 2-1 defeat to Stoke was unbelievable, says Mark Noble West Ham thought they had their goal with 11 minutes to play, but Glenn Whelan cleared Cheikhou Kouyate's goal-bound shot off the line with Given beaten. Charlie Adam nearly caught Randolph out with a long-range strike from inside his own half, but Hughes' side looked happy to settle for a point after a run of one win from nine games. Watch the moment Charlie Adam almost scored another goal from the half-way line during Stoke's 2-1 win against West Ham Watch the moment Charlie Adam almost scored another goal from the half-way line during Stoke's 2-1 win against West Ham But they snatched victory with a bullet header from Diouf, who darted in front of Valencia at the near post to power past the West Ham 'keeper. Paul Merson's verdict West Ham were the much better team in the first half. Stoke were getting booed and the fans were getting very frustrated and they went in 1-0 at half-time after a good goal by Antonio. West Ham turned it on again in the second half and should have scored, Valencia had one great chance which Given saved and at 2-0 it would have been game over. Ryan Shawcross says he is proud Stoke finished their season on a high after beating West Ham 2-1. Ryan Shawcross says he is proud Stoke finished their season on a high after beating West Ham 2-1. But they didn't and the game turned, Imbula made it 1-1 then West Ham had a couple more chances, one of which was cleared off the line. Then at the end Stoke had a corner and Diouf made it 2-1 with a good header. You do feel for West Ham, but you watch Stoke and that was them all over. They were poor first half, but then 15-20 minutes into the second half they turned it on, and when they did they were very, very good.

next season with a 1-1 draw at Swansea City on Sunday. The result leaves Man City three points ahead of Manchester United in fourth, whose final game of the Premier League season with Bournemouth was abandoned because of a security threat. Man City have an 18 better goal difference. In Manuel Pellegrini's last game as manager before Pep Guardiola takes over in the summer, Man City took an early lead through Kelechi Iheanacho but a deflected Andre Ayew free-kick levelled the scores right on half-time. Pellegrini named an unchanged team for his last game and Man City gave their manager a perfect start. Francesco Guidolin greets Manuel Pellegrini Sergio Aguero, who was chasing Harry Kane for the Golden Boot, found space in the area on six minutes and although his shot was blocked, Iheanacho hammered home the rebound from close range. Swansea City manager Francesco Guidolin was handed the job on a permanent basis in midweek and his side responded well. Jefferson Montero almost equalised on 10 minutes but his bundled effort at the back post was ruled out correctly for a push on defender Bacary Sagna. Manuel Pellegrini looked back at the season and felt it was a good one for Manchester City Manuel Pellegrini looked back at the season and felt it was a good one for Manchester City Aguero fired into the side netting on 12 minutes before Kevin De Bruyne tested debutant Swansea goalkeeper Kristoffer Nordfeldt from the edge of the area. The chances were raining down on Nordfeldt's goal but Iheanacho's final finish was lacking as he fired over from the edge of the box on 30 minutes and Aguero was denied by Nordfeldt's boot from close range minutes later.

He connected well with the free-kick but Joe Hart would have had it covered had it not cannoned off Fernando's head and into the top corner. Sergio Aguero tries to find space De Bruyne found Eliaquim Mangala on 48 minutes with a sensational delivery from the right but the centre-half headed over from close range. Swansea rarely looked capable of upping the tempo to do Manchester United a favour but Federico Fernandez wasted a good opportunity on 57 minutes by heading a Wayne Routledge corner over the bar. Both teams dropped the tempo in the last half-hour as chances were at a premium. Aguero was replaced in injury time by the soon to be out of contract Yaya Toure. Andre Ayew of Swansea City scores his team's first goal The farewell theme continued at full-time as Pellegrini went over to the away end to throw his suit jacket to the fans, who gave him a warm reception. It will be Guardiola leading them next season and he looks likely to have Champions League football to work with, although he'll have to negotiate his way through a two-legged qualifier to make the group stages.

[Kristoffer] Nordfeldt saves it but pushes it straight into Kelechi Iheanacho, who sorts his feet out and it's 1-0. \"Then it could have been anything, they had so many chances and you do start wondering, is there something in this crazy season that we've had? But they had done enough and Swansea were quite happy with what they had. Joe Hart admitted that Manchester City have let themselves down this season but said that they have got the job done Joe Hart admitted that Manchester City have let themselves down this season but said that they have got the job done \"I don't know how Swansea's goal is going to go down. Andre Ayew takes the free-kick and I think it would have been an easy save for Joe Hart, but it comes off Fernando and goes right over the other side. \"It drifted this game and it was poor. But you look at it, Pep Guardiola coming in he'll be happy he's got Champions League, and it keeps Manchester United out of it. \"Francesco Guidolin has done a terrific job for Swansea, finishing 12th

celebrates scoring his team's first goal Troy Deeney’s second-half penalty secured a point for Watford as they were held to a 2-2 draw by Sunderland in Quique Sanchez Flores’ final game in charge. Earlier in the game, Jack Rodwell and Jeremain Lens scored for Sunderland, either side of Sebastian Prodl's strike for the home side. With the pressure off, Sunderland manager Sam Allardyce made nine changes from his side's 3-0 win over Everton in midweek as he handed starts to Jordan Pickford, Tom Robson and Rees Greenwood in a youthful-looking line-up. Departing Watford boss Quique Sanchez Flores says it has been an enjoyable experience managing the Hornets Departing Watford boss Quique Sanchez Flores says it has been an enjoyable experience managing the Hornets Both sides struggled to fashion clear-cut openings in the early stages with Watford's Almen Abdi going closest with a low shot from the edge of the box that flew inches wide. Sunderland's first real chance came on the half hour mark when Lens picked out Duncan Watmore with a lovely dinked pass to the far post and the England U21 man volleyed back across goal where N'Doye was lurking but Miguel Britos managed to clear over the crossbar. Jack Rodwell beats Heurelho Gomes to score The game's first goal came in the 39th minute when Lens found Rodwell at the back post and he coolly slotted past Heurelho Gomes to put Sunderland in front. They should have been two ahead moments later when Watmore was played in behind the Watford defence and finished past Gomes, only to be flagged for offside. Replays appeared to show he was on. Watford drew level straight after half-time when Prodl outmuscled John O'Shea to power home a header from Adlene Guediora's corner. The visitors appealed for a push in the back but referee Kevin Friend was unmoved. Jeremain Lens of Sunderland scores his team's second goal Sunderland were soon back in front however, as Watmore found Lens with a measured through ball and he beat Nathan Ake with a skillful dummy, before slotting the ball past Gomes. The visitors came close to making it three when Dame N'Doye found the back of the net with a stooping header from Sebastian Larsson's free-kick. But the linesman again came to Watford's rescue as the goal was disallowed for offside. Sunderland boss Sam Allardyce says his side deserved to win after some questionable decicions in their draw at Watford Sunderland boss Sam Allardyce says his side deserved to win after some questionable decicions in their draw at Watford The home side got back into the game when O'Shea was penalised for a foul on Jurado. The Irish international looked to have won the ball in a 50/50 challenge but his leg was high and he caught Jurado on the follow-through. Deeney made no mistake from the resulting spot-kick as he sent Pickford the wrong way to secure a point for the home side.

of Liverpool defence during the Barclays Premier League A much-changed Liverpool missed out on a place in next season's Europa League after being held 1-1 by West Bromwich Albion at the Hawthorns on Sunday afternoon. Salomon Rondon gave the Baggies an early lead after being set up by youngster Jonathan Leko, only for the Reds to equalise through Jordan Ibe's brilliant solo goal. However, the draw was not enough to see eighth-placed Liverpool qualify for Europe's second-tier competition, although they can still progress to the Champions League group stages if they beat Sevilla in Wednesday's Europa League final. West Brom, meanwhile, ended the campaign in 14th - but will slip down a position if Bournemouth beat Manchester United in their rearranged final match - after failing to win any of their last nine Premier League games. Not surprisingly, Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp made 11 changes from the side that drew 1-1 with Chelsea at Anfield in midweek with Wednesday's Europa League final occupying the German's mind. Salomon Rondon celebrates after scoring for West Brom against Liverpool The visitors were also able to welcome back long-term absentees Danny Ings, who has been out with a knee ligament injury since mid-October, and captain Jordan Henderson, who has missed the last five weeks also with a knee problem. However, Belgian striker Divock Origi had not recovered in time from an ankle injury to join that duo on the substitutes' bench and must now be a doubt to face Sevilla. The Baggies, though, were more interested in finishing the season with a morale-boosting victory having suffered three straight home defeats. And Tony Pulis, who kept the same team for a third match in a row, would have been pleased with how his players began the encounter, and none more so than young forward Leko. The England U17 international created the opening goal after just 13 minutes with some neat footwork which saw him evade the close attentions of three Liverpool players, before sliding Rondon through on goal. Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp was pleased with how his young side played in their 1-1 draw at West Brom. Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp was pleased with how his young side played in their 1-1 draw at West Brom. And the Venezuelan kept his cool to easily beat Adam Bogdan - making his first appearance in goal for the Reds since December's 3-0 loss at Watford - at his near post for his ninth Premier League goal of the campaign. If that piece of skill was impressive, though, then that which brought about Liverpool's equaliser from Ibe 10 minutes later was even better. The England U21 international turned Jonny Evans on the right-hand touchline, before embarking on a jinking solo run that started on the halfway line and ended with a well-placed side-footed finish past Ben Foster. West Brom were unfortunate not to score a second goal thereafter, but a mixture of bad luck and poor finishing denied them a deserved winner after half-time, in particular Rondon. West Brom boss Tony Pulis says his side had enough chances to win after their draw with Liverpool. West Brom boss Tony Pulis says his side had enough chances to win after their draw with Liverpool. The Venezuela international saw a clever cushioned header from Craig Gardner's free-kick strike the post two minutes into the second period, before he somehow missed the target from the rebound. Rondon was even more unfortunate midway through the second period after Gardner's left-wing corner fell to his feet some six yards out. But with the goal gaping, the 26-year-old saw his goalbound strike deflected behind by Martin Skrtel's outstretched foot. Both sides rung the changes in the closing stages of the contest, with Klopp giving both Henderson and Ings a useful run-out in the final quarter of the match with Wednesday's season finale against Sevilla in mind. Barcelona academy product Sergi Canos, 19, also made his debut for the Reds with nine minutes remaining, while Pulis handed youngsters Tyler Roberts and Sam Field some valuable game time towards the end. Jordan Henderson made his return to action after injury in Liverpool's draw at West Brom. Jordan Henderson made his return to action after injury in Liverpool's draw at West Brom.

"report": "Dieumerci Mbokani celebrates his brace against Watford at a downbeat Carrow Road Norwich City beat Watford 4-2 at Carrow Road on Wednesday night, but it was not enough to prevent them from being relegated back to the Championship. The home side fell behind to Troy Deeney's opportunistic 11th-minute goal, before responding three times before half-time through Nathan Redmond, Dieumerci Mbokani and a Craig Cathcart own goal. However, with news coming through at the break of Sunderland leading Everton 2-0, the mood in East Anglia turned from joy to sorrow as Odion Ighalo broke his recent drought by pulling a goal back for the visitors. Jose Manuel Jurado of Watford takes on Ivo Pinto And despite Mbokani adding a second with a fine finish just before the hour-mark, the Canaries' Premier League relegation - 12 months after winning promotion via the play-offs - was confirmed by the full-time whistle at the Stadium of Light. Norwich boss Alex Neil opted to make four changes to the team that lost 1-0 at home to Manchester United on Saturday in a match the home side had to win to maintain their slim hopes of beating the drop. Norwich boss Alex Neil admitted his side fell short this season after they were relegated from the Premier League Norwich boss Alex Neil admitted his side fell short this season after they were relegated from the Premier League However, the Canaries made the worst possible start to proceedings after allowing opponents, who had lost six of their nine games leading into this contest, an early lead. Watford captain Deeney flicked the ball into the path of Ighalo and despite John Ruddy blocking the Nigerian's close-range effort, his strike partner was in the right place to tap home into an empty net. Dieumerci Mbokani scores for Norwich The hosts were not behind for long, though, with Redmond drawing them level four minutes later, albeit with help from Watford goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes. The Brazilian somehow allowed Redmond's near-post shot to squirm under his body after the winger had played a neat one-two with Steven Naismith on the edge of the box. And just three minutes later the contest was completely turned on its head as Norwich went ahead for the first time, with that man Redmond again heavily involved in the goal. Quique Sanchez Flores says his Watford side lost intensity, focus and attention in their defeat at Norwich Quique Sanchez Flores says his Watford side lost intensity, focus and attention in their defeat at Norwich The England U21 international collected possession towards the left-hand edge of the box, before cutting in and firing a low shot against the post. But giant forward Mbokani was there to convert the rebound from close range, despite desperate Watford appeals for offside. The hosts really took control of proceedings though eight minutes before the break when Allan Nyom's unfortunate slip allowed Wes Hoolahan to fire a dangerous left-wing cross into the box, forcing Cathcart to slice the ball past his own 'keeper. But as news of Sunderland's third goal on Wearside reached East Anglia, Norwich switched off temporarily as Deeney broke clear to the right-hand byline, before pulling the ball back for the unmarked Igahlo to score his 15th goal of the season from near the penalty spot. Nathan Redmond of Norwich City celebrates However, the Canaries had the final say with the best goal of the night as man-of-the-match Redmond cleverly played Mbokani through on goal, with the Congo striker keeping his cool with a lovely dinked finish past the advancing Gomes.

Kone is mobbed after his second goal against Everton Sunderland secured their Premier League status with a 3-0 victory over Everton on Wednesday, relegating Newcastle and Norwich in the process.

The pressure riding on Wednesday's game clearly effected the hosts early on as they frantically looked to exert themselves on the Toffees. Everton boss Roberto Martinez would not answer a question about his future after his side were beaten 3-0 away to Sunderland Everton boss Roberto Martinez would not answer a question about his future after his side were beaten 3-0 away to Sunderland Such was their desire to employ a high pressing game that they were almost caught out as Matthew Pennington flashed a header wide on 13 minutes. And news of Norwich taking the lead against Watford added to the tension on Wearside. Younes Kaboul created Sunderland's first clear chance but, having done so well to carry the ball into the opposition area, he lashed a curling effort inches wide. Van Aanholt wheels away in celebration with his manager There was no cause for concern, though, as it was left to two of Kaboul's defensive partners to move the Black Cats to within touching distance of safety. First Van Aanholt settled the nerves, sending a free-kick around the wall and beyond Joel Robles, who should have done better with the tame set piece. Patrick van Aanholt scores the opening goal on Wednesday The Everton goalkeeper atoned for his error by thwarting Jermain Defoe's forceful header shortly after but he was helpless with Sunderland's second as Kone crashed home a thunderous effort from close range. Pennington had an early chance for the visitors two minutes after the restart but Everton's defensive frailties - that have marred their season - soon reared their head again as the hosts were presented with a string of chances to wrap up the victory. Jan Kirchhoff was delighted after Sunderland's 3-0 win against Everton confirmed their Premier League status for next season Jan Kirchhoff was delighted after Sunderland's 3-0 win against Everton confirmed their Premier League status for next season Defoe was played onside by John Stones and only a last-gasp clearance on the goalline prevented his chipped effort from making it 3-0. But Everton's reprieve was short-lived as, from the resulting corner where Wahbi Khazri almost scored directly, Kone was on hand to sweep the ball home from close range to seal the first double of his 10-year professional career. Lamine Kone of Sunderland scores his team's second goal during the Barclays Premier League match between Sunderland and Khazri and Defoe then got their wires crossed on 58 minutes as Sunderland missed the chance to make it four, before Defoe was denied by Robles again on 66 minutes. Sunderland sat back from there on, content on defending their lead and top-flight status. Norwich relegated despite beating Watford 4-2 at Carrow Road A late Everton surge, which saw Romelu Lukaku rattled Vito Mannone's woodwork, was the closest the visitors came to a consolation as the Black Cats completed their annual escape act with ease.

The Belgian substitute converted into an empty net after Asmir Begovic had unconvincingly parried the ball into his path from a Sheyi Ojo cross. Chelsea took the lead after Eden Hazard skipped through three challenges before slotting into the bottom corner just after the half-hour mark, a contender for goal of the season. Eden Hazard celebrates his superb goal in the first half The result means Liverpool must win at West Brom and hope Southampton lose or draw at home to Crystal Palace to finish seventh and have a chance of qualifying for the Europa League next season. However, seventh will only qualify for the Europa League if Manchester United win in the FA Cup final against Palace and finish in the top six. Liverpool can of course qualify for the Champions League if they beat Sevilla in the Europa League final on May 18. Jurgen Klopp made eight changes from the weakened side that beat Watford 2-0 on Sunday, while Guus Hiddink made four after the 3-2 defeat by Sunderland. Liverpool had the better of the game early on, with Baba Rahman's block six yards out denying Philippe Coutinho a sure goal after Alberto Moreno had pulled the ball back to him on the penalty spot. Begovic, in for Thibaut Courtois, parried away Adam Lallana's right-footed effort from long range shortly after, while at the other end Simon Mignolet got down well to block Hazard's dipping effort. Daniel Sturridge looks to slip the ball past Willian and Nemanja Matic Chelsea were ahead on 32 minutes through Hazard, who has belatedly hit form in recent months after a disappointing campaign for last year's PFA Player of the Year. Picking the ball up wide on the left 40 yards from goal, Hazard superbly danced through three challenges before slotting the ball into the bottom right corner from 18 yards. Mignolet then found himself caught between the goal-line and Bertrand Traore with the ball at the striker's feet, but luckily for the Belgian, the Chelsea man could only curl the ball just high and wide. Hazard was back to his scintillating best at Anfield, and again took on two Liverpool players before being denied by Mignolet's fine save to his right, while Begovic did well to deny Daniel Sturridge from close range after Lallana had played his England team-mate through on goal. Mignolet saved again from Pedro and then Bertrand Traore's long-range effort, while Lallana's close-range effort was blocked on the line by Begovic as the game neared an end. Hazard was thwarted once more by his Belgian team-mate Mignolet in stoppage time, but it was their compatriot Benteke who scored the Reds' equaliser just 15 minutes after coming on. Begovic was caught out by Ojo's deep cross, parrying the ball into Benteke's path to nod home unmarked from three yards for his 10th goal of the season.

"report": "Winston Reid scored the final goal at the Boleyn Ground West Ham bade farewell to the Boleyn Ground with a thrilling 3-2 victory over Manchester United on Tuesday night. On an emotionally-charged night, where the Hammers ended their 112-year association with their iconic stadium, Winston Reid wrote his name in the history books with the landmark final goal, which proved to be the winner. Diafra Sakho's deflected strike had broken the deadlock on 10 minutes - but two Anthony Martial goals in 21 second-half minutes turned the game on its head as Louis van Gaal's side looked set to keep Champions League qualification in their own hands. Winston Reid will go down in West Ham history as the defender scored the final goal at the Boleyn Ground Winston Reid will go down in West Ham history as the defender scored the final goal at the Boleyn Ground But West Ham, who had overran their visitors in a stunning first-half display, found a second wind, wrestling back the lead through Michail Antonio before Reid hit the winner on 80 minutes. The result strengthens West Ham's claims for Europa League football, with the win enough to move them to within a point of Manchester United, who handed the initiative back to neighbours City in the race for the top four. The bus carrying the Manchester United team is escorted by police after having a window smashed on its way to West Ham's Boleyn Ground The Manchester United team were caught in crowd trouble en route to the Boleyn, with their bus windows smashed in unsavoury scenes outside the ground. Kick-off was delayed by 45 minutes but that only stoked the already passionate crowd gathering, who yearned for an early goal on their night of celebration. Watch from inside the Manchester United team coach as it was attacked on its way to Upton Park for the game against West Ham Watch from inside the Manchester United team coach as it was attacked on its way to Upton Park for the game against West Ham The visitors quelled an early West Ham onslaught but their defence was soon breached when Sakho, having peeled away to the penalty spot, twisted to guide Manuel Lanzini's pull-back past David de Gea via a deflection off Daley Blind. Blind's carelessness at the back almost gifted the hosts a second on 20 minutes, with the deep-lying Dutchman playing Carroll onside. Lanzini slotted the former England striker through on goal but De Gea came to the Red Devils' rescue, stopping a low effort with his legs. De Gea was breached on 22 minutes but Antonio was denied a second as referee Mike Dean and his officials judged the ball to have gone out of play leading up to the right-back's close-range header, and awarded a corner. Wayne Rooney of Manchester United shoots past Mark Noble Wayne Rooney mustered his side's one, and only, shot of the first half, but his ambitious effort ballooned high into the Bobby Moore Stand. The Hammers dominated from there on, but Dimitri Payet was unable to convert their dominance into a second on 32 minutes when, after Martial was dispossessed Noble, he lashed his shot wide. Winston Reid celebrates Martial saw a half-hearted penalty claim waved away on the stroke of half-time as the Hammers went into the break with their deserved lead intact. Former West Ham midfielder Michael Carrick was introduced after the interval as Van Gaal sought a route back into the contest. And they were level within six minutes as Martial converted Juan Mata's pass from close range at the end of a brisk counter. Sakho should have restored the hosts' lead five minutes later but his stooping header failed to convert Payet's inch-perfect cross into the area. Manchester United's team coach was attacked as it neared Upton Park for their game against West Ham Manchester United's team coach was attacked as it neared Upton Park for their game against West Ham Martial then produced a moment of individual brilliance on 72 minutes as he skipped past Reid and beat Darren Randolph at his near post with a chipped finish. But the Hammers rallied and were level within four minutes as Payet found Antonio with a short free-kick, and he floated a header home. Diafra Sakho celebrates after giving West Ham the lead The turnaround was complete 10 minutes from time as centre-back Reid's header evaded the clutches of De Gea and the Hammers ended their Boleyn Ground account with a victory that will live long in the memory. Manager Bilic was in tears as the full-time whistle sounded - before the fans were treated to a lavish closing ceremony to mark the final match at their home of 112 years.

Meanwhile, Tottenham remain second on 70 points, two points clear of Arsenal, who drew 2-2 with Manchester City later in the day. Spurs go to Newcastle on the final day of the season while Arsenal are at home to Aston Villa. Spurs started on the front foot against Saints and only a fine save from Forster denied Christian Eriksen after six minutes, but the keeper was slow off his line when Spurs opened the scoring, allowing Son to nip past his challenge and tap into an empty net. Son capitalised on sluggish Southampton defending to open the scoring Despite the setback Ronald Koeman's side carried a threat on the break, and Dusan Tadic had already spurned one chance to tee up Davis before the Serbia international made amends for Southampton's equaliser. Excellent against Man City last weekend, Tadic plucked the ball out of the air and crossed for Davis, who squeezed his effort past Lloris. Both sides had opportunities before the break, the best falling to Harry Kane, who was denied by Forster after robbing Jose Fonte on the byline. Eric Dier halts Sadio Mane with a challenge in midfield Long headed wide shortly after half-time as the visitors more than matched their opponents, and Koeman's side went ahead with 18 minutes to play. Tadic was again involved, providing his sixth assist in his last four matches as Davis took his return pass and dribbled a shot through a clutch of Spurs defenders to find the bottom corner. Steven Davis was delighted to score twice as Southampton came from behind to beat Tottenham. Steven Davis was delighted to score twice as Southampton came from behind to beat Tottenham. Southampton continued to look dangerous on the break as Spurs pressed forward, Long and substitute James Ward-Prowse firing over, but the final chance of the match fell to the hosts.

Ronald Koeman was proud of his Southampton side's performance against Tottenham and their effort overall across the course of the season. A win or draw for Southampton in their final match against Crystal Palace will see the Saints break their record points tally - currently 60.

They are winless in three games and face the prospect of entering the final weekend of the season level on points with Arsenal if the Gunners beat Man City on Sunday afternoon.

Coutinho holds off Watford's Almen Abdi A much-changed Liverpool beat Watford 2-0 at Anfield on Sunday afternoon to maintain their hopes of a top-six finish. The home side led at half-time thanks to a rare Joe Allen strike - just his second in the league this season - before substitute Roberto Firmino sealed the points with his 11th goal of the season 14 minutes from the end. Despite remaining in eighth place in the table, the win sees the Reds move to within just two points of sixth-placed Southampton - with a game in hand on the Saints - while Watford stay 13th. Unsurprisingly, Jurgen Klopp made eight alterations from the team that beat Villarreal to reach the Europa League final on Thursday night, with only Simon Mignolet, Alberto Moreno and Philippe Coutinho keeping their places. Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp says his side were the better team after they beat Watford at Anfield Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp says his side were the better team after they beat Watford at Anfield However, unlike in last weekend's 3-1 loss at Swansea, when Klopp also made a whole raft of changes with European commitments in mind, Liverpool produced a far more cohesive display at a sun-drenched Anfield. The hosts found it hard to carve out any real openings in the first half though, that is until they took the lead 10 minutes before half-time with their first shot on target in the game. Watford boss Quique Sanchez Flores says his side played well despite their defeat to Liverpool Watford boss Quique Sanchez Flores says his side played well despite their defeat to Liverpool Allen was fouled midway in Watford's half, with Kevin Stewart quickly playing the ball to Philippe Coutinho, who in turn picked out Christian Benteke on the edge of the area. The Belgian striker, making a rare start in attack for the Reds, then did well to cushion a lovely header right into the path of Allen, with the unmarked midfielder keeping his cool to easily slide the ball past Heurelho Gomes. The visitors' greatest danger came from top-scorer Odion Ighalo, who while on the fringes of play before the break, really came to prominence in the second period with his side's best two chances. Joe Allen (second from left) is congratulated after opening the scoring However, on each occasion the Nigeria international was denied by the brilliance of Mignolet, who was only playing after back-up goalkeeper Danny Ward suffered a knee injury prior to the match. The goalkeeper's first impressive stop came 10 minutes after the interval after Ighalo had somehow managed to wriggle free on the edge of Liverpool's box, only for Mignolet to get fingertips to his shot. Roberto Firmino scored Liverpool's second in the 2-0 victory over Watford Then with time running out, Mignolet was again on hand to turn Ighalo's well-struck effort from a tight angle against the outside of the post. By that stage, Liverpool had already doubled their lead thanks to Firmino's 76th-minute strike, although in contrast to Mignolet's impressive stops, Watford No 1 Gomes will be disappointed with his part in the goal. Watford left-back Ikechi Anya saw his attempted clearance charged down by Sheyi Ojo, allowing Firmino to then drive at the visitors' back four, before the Brazilian beat Gomes with a low shot that somehow made its way through his compatriot.

Kevin de Bruyne made it 2-1 early in the second half with a fine individual effort, only for Alexis Sanchez to fire in an equaliser from the edge of the box. Wilfried Bony almost restored City's lead when he volleyed against the bar but there was to be no late winner in Manuel Pellegrini's last game in charge at the Etihad.

Manchester City midfielder Fernandinho was disappointed not to beat Arsenal after twice taking the lead in the game Manchester City midfielder Fernandinho was disappointed not to beat Arsenal after twice taking the lead in the game Having been criticised for their limp display against Real Madrid in midweek, City started with much more purpose and intensity at the Etihad. They were rewarded in the eighth minute as Fernandinho headed down for Aguero, who took a touch and then fired into the bottom corner. But City then shot themselves in the foot.

The visitors took a crucial three points when Wayne Rooney played in Mata and the Spain international kept his cool to beat John Ruddy with a close-range finish after 72 minutes. United move to within just a point of fourth-placed city-rivals Manchester City - until Sunday at least - in the fourth and final Champions League berth with just two games left to play this campaign, while Norwich slipped points from safety after Sunderland's win against Chelsea. Norwich boss Alex Neil opted to stick with the same XI who lost 1-0 at Arsenal last Saturday, despite the strugglers having failed to score in nine of the 14 Premier League matches leading up to this contest Manchester United midfielder Michael Carrick and Norwich's Wes Hoolahan compete for the ball at Carrow Road United, meanwhile, opted to rest both Daley Blind - who has been a virtual ever present in their team so far this season - and young striker Marcus Rashford with a crucial trip to Champions League-chasing rivals West Ham to come on Tuesday. But Louis van Gaal's side suffered an injury blow even before the match had started when top-scorer Anthony Martial pulled his hamstring in the warm-up, with Ander Herrera coming into replace the France attacker. That untimely setback appeared to disrupt United as their opponents dominated a tense and error-strewn first half, albeit without making that crucial breakthrough on a balmy afternoon in East Anglia. Louis van Gaal basked in the sunshine ahead of Manchester United's clash with Norwich City The Canaries' best chance came after just four minutes when the lively Nathan Redmond got to the left-hand byline, before standing an inviting cross up for Cameron Jerome, only for the striker to place his header too close to David De Gea. United, who also lost left-back Matteo Darmian to an early ankle injury after an innocuous-looking clash with Ivo Pinto, barely threatened the Norwich goal before the break. In fact, the closest the visitors came to scoring in the first period was when Chris Smalling somehow headed Juan Mata's right-wing corner over the bar from only three yards out just before the half-hour mark. Cameron Jerome misses his side's best chance of the match after heading straight at David de Gea The second half was an equally disjointed affair, that is until United broke the deadlock with 18 minutes to go after another misjudgement from Norwich centre-back Sebastien Bassong. The experienced Cameroon international failed to cut out a simple ball over the top for Wayne Rooney and despite seeming to waste the opportunity, United's captain kept his composure to set up Mata for his ninth goal of the campaign, and his fifth league strike against Norwich. Manchester United's Spanish midfielder Juan Mata (L) scores his side's winner Norwich reacted to falling behind by introducing Patrick Bamford to join both Jerome and Dieumerci Mbokani - who came on just after the hour-mark - in a three-man forward line. However, the Canaries' struggles in front of goal continued in the closing stages as they failed to create any clear-cut openings to draw themselves level.

Jack Colback and Aleksandar Mitrovic each squandered second-half opportunities to break the deadlock at Villa Park as Rafa Benitez's side failed to break down the Premier League's worst defence. The draw, combined with Sunderland's victory over Chelsea, means Newcastle drop into the relegation zone and they will be relegated if Sunderland beat Everton in front of the Sky Sports cameras on Wednesday. Aston Villa will play in the Championship next season Villa, in their final Premier League home game before relegation, failed to register a shot on target but did prevent a club-record 12th consecutive league defeat as they picked up their first point since February. Rafa Benitez named an unchanged team from Newcastle's victory over Crystal Palace, but they struggled for fluency in a tepid first half. Kevin Toner, handed his second league start by interim Villa boss Eric Black, was tasked with keeping tabs on Andros Townsend, and the in-form Newcastle winger was largely kept in check. Charlie Nicholas gives his reaction to the Aston Villa and Newcastle Utd stalemate. Charlie Nicholas gives his reaction to the Aston Villa and Newcastle Utd stalemate. The visitors' best chance of the first 45 minutes fell to Papiss Cisse, who snatched at his shot after Vurnon Anita's measured through-ball. The same combination ended in a similar result 10 minutes before half-time as an unmarked Cisse miscued his volley into the arms of Aston Villa goalkeeper Mark Bunn. Having impressed in the second half against Liverpool and Palace in their previous two matches, Newcastle came out after the break at a higher tempo and missed two golden opportunities inside the first 15 minutes. First, Colback blazed over from 10 yards before Mitrovic, who replaced the ineffective Cisse after 52 minutes, lobbed over with only Bunn to beat. Aston Villa fans protested during the game by throwing beach balls on to the pitch Benitez sacrificed his defensive midfield to throw on Ayoze Perez and Siem De Jong, but the visitors toiled as the game progressed and they failed to create any clearer chances. Bunn beat clear a firm strike from Georginio Wijnaldum and Mitrovic nodded wide from Colback's delivery, but Villa's defence was rarely stretched. News of Sunderland's dramatic fightback against Chelsea filtered through the ground as Newcastle surged forward in six minutes of added time, but Ciaran Clark's brave block from Wijnaldum's volley was as close as Benitez's side got to a late winner. Aleksandar Mitrovic says Newcastle must move on following their disappointing 0-0 draw at rock-bottom Aston Villa. Aleksandar Mitrovic says Newcastle must move on following their disappointing 0-0 draw at rock-bottom Aston Villa. They host Tottenham on the final day of the season but may be already relegated by then. They have 34 points, one fewer than Sunderland, who have their game in hand against Everton at the Stadium of Light. As for Villa, they conclude their season at the Emirates against Arsenal before turning their attention to the Championship. Soccer Saturday verdict - Charlie Nicholas This was a game I was rather disappointed with. In the first 45 minutes, Aston Villa didn't really put many passes together. It was so flat, it was a crazy first 45 minutes that lacked true ambition. The second-half changed a little bit. In the end Villa threatened just a couple of times but Newcastle ran out of ideas. Now Newcastle really have it all to do. They've got to try and hope Sunderland don't get anything, it's out of their control and they didn't deserve to win for me today. They might have created more chances but a goalless draw at this stage of the season is not helpful.

Vitality Matt Ritchie's late equaliser ensured Bournemouth snatched a 1-1 draw against West Brom in their final home match of the season. Salomon Rondon got on the end of a superb Jonny Evans cross after 16 minutes to put the Baggies en route to three points on the south coast. The lead should have been greater at the interval, but Craig Gardner saw his penalty brilliantly saved by Artur Boruc in the Bournemouth goal two minutes before the break, and that third West Brom penalty miss in a row proved costly as Ritchie headed a late equaliser. Matt Le Tissier gives his reaction to Bournemouth's 1-1 with West Brom Matt Le Tissier gives his reaction to Bournemouth's 1-1 with West Brom With both sides already safe from relegation on 42 points, the result matters little, but Ritchie's late intervention means Tony Pulis's side are on an end-of-season run of eight league games without a win. The first half saw the Cherries enjoy all the possession without every really causing problems, and it was the visitors who enjoyed the better of the chances. Salomon Rondon put West Brom in front Gardner deflected a Craig Dawson strike just wide of the post before Rondon broke the deadlock in deadly fashion. Boruc's clearance was really poor, young Jonathan Leko picked up the loose ball, showed great feet to pick out Evans, who whipped a perfect cross onto the head of Rondon. He powered the ball past the despairing dive of Boruc. Rondon (left) celebrates with Craig Gardner after his goal Gardner was then denied by a brilliant stop from Boruc low to the 'keeper's right, before ratoning for his earlier error to deny Gardner again, this time from 12 yards. Tommy Elphick needlessly conceded the penalty, pulling Dawson to the floor, but Gardner's powerful penalty was brilliantly touched onto the crossbar by Boruc, who had the awareness to get up and claw away the rebound. After the break, the pattern of the match stayed the same, with the home side enjoying all of the ball without ever really threatening. Both sides made changes which made a difference, with Callum Wilson and Josh King injecting more intensity into the Cherries' play. Harry Arter was fortunate to stay on the pitch after lunging in dangerously on Darren Fletcher, before Ritchie punished the Baggies for their profligacy eight minutes from time. Steve Cook launched a long throw into the middle, the Baggies failed to clear it, allowing substitute Ritchie to head in from close range. It was poor defending from Tony Pulis' men to allow the ball to bounce. The game came to life as a result, with Dawson coming within inches of a winner down the other end, but he was denied by the post, meaning both had to settle for a point which keeps the pair locked on 42 points. Soccer Saturday verdict - Matt Le Tissier In the first-half, Bournemouth created absolutely nothing. West Brom were very solid defensively. Afobe and Grabban up front had no impact on this game at all in the first half and you couldn't see how Bournemouth were going to get back into this game. I'd say that Bournemouth were probably Bournemouth a little bit fortunate to get a point out of it.

Two second-half strikes from Dwight Gayle helped the Eagles come from behind against Mark Hughes' men, who have now lost four of their last five league games. Palace dominated possession in the game's early stages but fell behind to a well-worked Charlie Adam strike midway through the first half. Gayle, in for injured club captain Mile Jedinak, levelled the scores with a simple finish shortly after half-time. The former Peterborough striker then grabbed his second with a well-struck free-kick after Connor Wickham had been brought down by Ryan Shawcross. The home side began the game brightly and went close to an opener inside two minutes when Yohan Cabaye fired a deflected free-kick narrowly wide of Jakob Haugaard's right-hand post. Palace then had a penalty appeal turned down by referee Kevin Friend after Gayle was bundled over, although contact appeared to occur outside the box. Gayle's brace confirmed Crystal Palace will be in the Premier League next season Gayle's brace confirmed Crystal Palace will be in the Premier League next season Palace manager Alan Pardew's side were enjoying long spells of possession in the sunshine at Selhurst but were unable to fashion any clear-cut chances, with Jason Puncheon and Joel Ward both guilty of wasting shots in and around the Stoke box. The Potters began to grow into the game and should have taken the lead through Xherdan Shaqiri. The Switzerland international was played through on goal by Marko Arnautovic, only to fire straight at Hennessey. However, the visitors didn't have to wait long for an opening goal. After winning the ball in midfield, Giannelli Imbula fed Arnautovic, who in turn played in Adam with a perfectly weighted through-ball. Stoke's Giannelli Imbula evades Palace midfielder James McArthur The former Liverpool and Blackpool midfielder, starting just his second game of the season, fired a low shot past Hennessey into the bottom right corner. Palace were stung into action and had another penalty shout dismissed when Gayle went down in the box under pressure shortly before half-time. Pardew would have been concerned with his side's first half performance, along with an injury to Cabaye that forced the France midfielder off at half-time. Palace had been limited to a number of speculative efforts in the first period but took just one minute to equalise in the second. Crystal Palace's Joel Ward is put under pressure by Stoke's Erik Pieters Yannick Bolasie received the ball inside the opposition's half and managed to weave his way past two defenders before appearing to be tripped in the area. Friend allowed play to continue after the ball fell to Gayle, who made no mistake with a simple finish past Haugaard. Puncheon then fired over from close range, shortly before Wickham hit the post with a header, as Palace threatened to cut loose. Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew will now have one eye on the FA Cup final against Manchester United on May 21 A second home goal seemed inevitable and duly arrived from the boot of Gayle, who curled a superb 25 yard free-kick into Haugaard's top corner to put the hosts deservedly ahead with 20 minutes remaining. Hughes responded by introducing Stephen Ireland and Jonathon Walters and the double change appeared to work almost immediately when Peter Crouch went close with a header from inside the six-yard box. Walters then scuffed a shot from a promising area whilst Arnautovic shot over the bar with an open goal gaping as Stoke pushed for an equaliser in the closing stages of the match. However, Palace were able to hold on to a vital win which quelled any lingering concerns surrounding the club's Premier League survival this season.

The Black Cats trailed 2-1 at the break after Diego Costa and Nemanja Matic scored either side of Wahbi Khazri's sweetly struck volley. But Fabio Borini levelled the match in the 67th minute and Jermain Defoe fired his 18th goal of the season soon afterwards to put the hosts ahead for the first time. John Terry was sent off late in the game for a second booking and Sunderland held on to climb out of the bottom three. With Newcastle only managing a point against Aston Villa, the Black Cats can now secure their top-flight status with a win in midweek against Everton - a game live on Sky Sports 1 HD - and in the process relegate the Magpies along with Norwich and Villa. It was a scenario that looked unlikely for much of the match on Saturday. Defoe believes Sunderland's character helped them overcome Chelsea Defoe believes Sunderland's character helped them overcome Chelsea Although Sunderland started positively, with Gary Cahill booked inside the first minute for bringing down Defoe, it was Chelsea who created the first chances and took an early lead. Cahill's pass deflected through kindly for Costa, who kept his cool to finish from close range. Chelsea continued to threaten and the closest Sunderland came was when DeAndre Yedlin headed at Thibaut Courtois from Defoe's cross. Wahbi Khazri celebrates equalising for Sunderland The Black Cats needed a moment of inspiration and it arrived late in the half as Khazri struck a superb volley from the edge of the box which took a slight deflection as it arrowed into the far corner. At that stage it looked like the hosts would go in at the break with the momentum, but they suffered a setback deep into injury-time as they failed to clear their lines and Matic pounced to finish under Vito Mannone. Phil Thompson reacts to Sunderland's victory over Chelsea. Phil Thompson reacts to Sunderland's victory over Chelsea. While the Sunderland keeper was beaten on that occasion, he saved twice from Costa in the second half to prevent the visitors extending their lead further. First he denied the striker after he was through on goal and then came out sharply to block another shot after a slick passing move. The saves would prove crucial as Sunderland turned the game around with two goals in two-and-a-half minutes. Defoe celebrates after scoring the winner at the Stadium of Light Borini levelled when his shot from the edge of the box deflected off Terry and beat Courtois before Defoe fired home from around the penalty spot shortly afterwards. Although the final 20 minutes was nervy, Sunderland held on and the visitors finished with 10 men as Terry was shown a second yellow for fouling Khazri. Soccer Saturday verdict - Phil Thompson In the first-half, Sunderland were chasing shadows. Chelsea had nothing to play for and were passing it around. Sunderland went in 2-1 down, they were all over the place and you thought Chelsea were more than comfortable. You were catching your breath in the second-half when the ball comes from the right-hand side, it takes a flick off a Chelsea player round about the penalty spot and Defoe takes one touch. A player of his class takes one touch, controls the ball and he drives it past Courtois. It was unbelievable and the noise was incredible. It was an unbelievable turnaround.

Dimitri Payet came close to opening the scoring inside three minutes, but his curling effort from the edge of the box was turned behind by Lukasz Fabianski. Swansea winger Modou Barrow gets to the ball ahead of West Ham midfielder Chiekhou Kouyate The France international continued to be a threat for West Ham and went close again after 18 minutes, firing a free-kick just over the crossbar. But, against the run of play, Swansea broke the deadlock and stunned a boisterous home support into silence. Ki and Kyle Naughton combined to great effect with the latter delivering a fabulous first-time ball across the six-yard box for Routledge to tap home. Francesco Guidolin thought Swansea were excellent in their 4-1 win but refused to answer any questions regarding his future Francesco Guidolin thought Swansea were excellent in their 4-1 win but refused to answer any questions regarding his future From then on, Swansea grew in confidence and were soon 2-0 up. Kingsley, one of six changes made by Francesco Guidolin, picked out Ayew inside the 18-yard box and the forward made no mistake, crashing his effort past Randolph. West Ham briefly threatened to pull a goal back before half-time, but Andy Carroll and Manuel Lanzini failed to keep their efforts on target. After the interval, Swansea continued to be the most threatening of the sides and grabbed their third when Ki rattled his volley into the bottom corner of the net following good work on the left flank by the impressive Modou Barrow. Kingsley raised hopes of a West Ham comeback when he inadvertently bundled home from close range after Michail Antonio and Sakho were denied by Fabianski. But Swansea would extend their lead in the closing stages with substitute Gomis slotting his shot into the bottom corner after a neat exchange of passes with Ayew. Soccer Saturday verdict - Paul Merson I thought Swansea were outstanding, I really did. They picked their passes on the counter attack and they were very ruthless. The atmosphere at the start of the game was absolutely phenomenal, at the end you would have thought it was raining. It was terrible. The fans couldn't believe it, Bilic couldn't believe it. Everybody has one of those games in their locker during the season, I don't care who you are. But to pick this day, and I really do think it was 'Oh, Swansea have got six changes, we'll turn these over' Match ratings West Ham: Randolph (6), Antonio (5), Cresswell (5), Reid (5), Ogbonna (5), Noble (6), Kouyate (5), Moses (5), Lanzini (6), Payet (6), Carroll (5).

Morgan and Claudio Ranieri lifted the trophy amid ecstatic scenes Wes Morgan and Claudio Ranieri lifted the trophy amid ecstatic scenes Jamie Vardy scored twice as Leicester celebrated being crowned Premier League champions with a 3-1 win against Everton at the King Power Stadium. In a carnival atmosphere, opera legend Andrea Bocelli started the title party by singing before kick-off before Vardy sparked the festivities into life on the pitch, converting Andy King's cross in just the fifth minute. King, who has won League One, the Championship and the Premier League with Leicester, got himself on the scoresheet in the 33rd minute, firing home from 10 yards after good work from Riyad Mahrez. The celebrations continued after the break as Vardy, who returned to the starting line-up following a two-match suspension, scored his 24th Premier League goal of the season from the penalty spot after being brought down by Matthew Pennington. Claudio Ranieri reflected on Leicester's amazing season and says he wants the fans to keep dreaming Claudio Ranieri reflected on Leicester's amazing season and says he wants the fans to keep dreaming Five minutes later the England forward had the chance to complete his hat-trick, again from the spot, but this time he blazed high over the crossbar. There was still time for Everton to grab a consolation in the 88th minute through substitute Kevin Mirallas but it could not dampen the mood around the King Power stadium as Leicester finally got their hands on the Premier League trophy. Andrea Bocelli sang Nessun Dorma to Ranieri and the Leicester fans Andrea Bocelli sang Nessun Dorma to Ranieri and the Leicester fans After being confirmed champions following Tottenham's 2-2 draw with Chelsea last Monday, Leicester's celebrations had been in full flow all week and they continued all the way to kick-off. There was a superb atmosphere as classical singer Bocelli, who promised Ranieri six weeks ago that he would sing if the Foxes won the league, performed Nessun Dorma and Time to Say Goodbye before kick-off. And it certainly inspired Leicester, who showed no signs of any hangover after their celebrations, as they took the lead in only the fifth minute after Vardy latched onto King's inch-perfect pass before firing past Joel Robles. Leicester captain Morgan admitted he felt drained after lifting the trophy Leicester captain Morgan admitted he felt drained after lifting the trophy Leicester, roared on by their supporters, were showing no signs of letting up as Mahrez picked out King at the far post, but the midfielder's header was kept out by Robles. Everton threatened in the 16th minute when Bryan Oviedo's low cross was turned behind Marcin Wasilewski, but it was all about Leicester and three minutes later Morgan was bursting into the visitors' penalty area before trying to pick out a team-mate. There was a party atmosphere all day in Leicester Out-of-form Romelu Lukaku was denied by Wasilewski and Tom Cleverley clipped over on rare Everton voyages forwards, with N'Golo Kante's hopeful effort saved by Robles. The heavens opened in Leicester as City continued to go forward, with King following up fine work by Mahrez to power home when the ball fell kindly for him in the box. Morgan and Mahrez missed the target before the break, after which Kasper Schmeichel denied Oumar Niasse with an unorthodox header before preventing a Lukaku back-heel. The Belgium international was again denied by the Leicester goalkeeper, whose opposite number had to be alert to deny Fuchs driving home after being realeased by Mahrez. Vardy reacts after scoring twice in Leicester's title party Vardy reacts after scoring twice in Leicester's title party Robles would soon be beaten, though, as Pennington brought down Vardy, with the Everton defender avoiding a second booking but giving away a penalty. The England striker made no mistake with the penalty and seven minutes later, Leicester's top scorer had another chance from the spot after a wild Darron Gibson challenge on Jeffrey Schlupp. Vardy stepped up again but this time he got his effort all wrong, ballooning the ball high over Robles' crossbar. Vardy scored his first penalty, but blazed a second over the crossbar Leonardo Ulloa and King flicked headers wide as the clock wound down, with Oviedo denying Vardy the hat-trick he craved, before Mirallas grabbed a late consolation. The strike visibly annoyed Schmeichel and his defensive colleagues, who wanted a clean sheet, but their disappointment soon turned to joy as Leicester captain Morgan lifted the Premier League trophy to cap the greatest day in the club's 132-year history.

Martin Tyler joins Patrick Davison to reflect on Chelsea's draw with Tottenham and Leicester winning the Premier League Martin Tyler joins Patrick Davison to reflect on Chelsea's draw with Tottenham and Leicester winning the Premier League Knowing nothing but a victory would keep them in with a chance of winning a first title since 1961, Spurs stormed into a two goal first-half lead with Harry Kane (35) and Son Heung-min (44) netting within nine minutes of each other. Tempers boiled over just before the interval when Danny Rose and Willian had to be pulled apart by Mauricio Pochettino, before Mousa Dembele appeared to gouge Diego Costa's eye. Gary Cahill scores Chelsea's first goal Chelsea, buoyed by the introduction of Hazard, were right back in it in the 58th minute thanks to Gary Cahill's strike, leaving a nervous 32 minutes for both Spurs and Leicester, whose players watched the game at Jamie Vardy's house. And they would have been celebrating as Hazard curled in a spectacular equaliser to hand Claudio Ranieri's side a first top-flight title in their 132-year history and leaving Spurs wondering what might have been. Following Leicester's 1-1 draw at Manchester United, Spurs started the game eight points behind Ranieri's side, knowing nothing but a win would keep them in touch with the league leaders. Chelsea captain John Terry heaped praise on Premier League champions Leicester Chelsea captain John Terry heaped praise on Premier League champions Leicester Much had been made of Chelsea's desire to end Tottenham's title hopes before kick-off and unsurprisingly Guus Hiddink's side flew out of the blocks with Cahill, back in the side alongside John Terry, heading Cesc Fabregas' corner wide of the upright. Tottenham saw off the opening onslaught and had a chance of their own in the 11th minute as Rose let fly from distance, but Asmir Begovic watched on as the ball sailed over the crossbar. Mousa Dembele (left) and Diego Costa clash just before half-time In a feisty affair, John Obi Mikel and Dembele squared up to each other before Kyle Walker appeared to kick out at Pedro after the winger had gone to ground. Cesc Fabregas fired wide in the 27th minute after good work from Diego Costa and minutes later referee Mark Clattenburg flashed the first yellow card of the night to Rose after another clash with Pedro in the build-up to the chance. Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino said he was extremely proud of his side for what they have achieved this season Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino said he was extremely proud of his side for what they have achieved this season Two minutes later, it was Spurs' turn to go close with Kane finding Son at the back post, but the South Korea international lashed his shot wide of the far post. They were not to be denied for long though as Erik Lamela slipped the ball through to Kane, who timed his run perfectly to beat the offside trap and then calmly rounded Begovic, before tapping the ball into the net for his 25th goal of the season. Tottenham forward Son Heung-Min scores his team's second goal The away end was celebrating again in the 44th minute as Kane pounced on Branislav Ivanovic's loose pass to pick out Christian Eriksen, who beautifully put Son in on goal, and the forward fired a right-footed shot past Begovic to put Spurs firmly on course for all three points. There was still time before the half-time whistle for yet another fracas as Rose and Willian squared up near the touch-line, prompting Pochettino to storm onto the field to separate them as players from both sides pile in. Bookings for Rose and Willian followed, but Dembele escaped punishment of his own after seeming to gouge Costa in the eye during the melee. Tottenham midfielder Erik Lamela said his side can hold their heads high after a fantastic season at the club Tottenham midfielder Erik Lamela said his side can hold their heads high after a fantastic season at the club Hiddink reacted by bringing Hazard on for Pedro at the break but it was Tottenham who kept coming forward with Kane's low shot saved by Begovic before Son fired wide. However, Chelsea seemed to be energised by the introduction of Hazard, who cut in from the left flank in the 52nd minute, firing a low shot towards the bottom corner which Hugo Lloris saved comfortably. Cahill (left) celebrates with team-mate Willian Six minutes later, the hosts were right back in it as Cahill brought down Willian's corner before firing firing a left-footed shot into the net. Chelsea's tails were up as Willian's curled effort was saved and Pochettino responded by bringing on Ryan Mason for goalscorer Son.

The comeback was complete seven minutes from time and it was last year's PFA Player of the Year, Hazard, who ended Spurs' title hopes. Tottenham striker Harry Kane said his side were disappointed to lose the Premier League title Tottenham striker Harry Kane said his side were disappointed to lose the Premier League title The 25-year-old, who scored Chelsea's title-winning goal against Crystal Palace last May, secured the title for Leicester with a superb first-time shot which curled into the top corner to send the home fans - and Leicester - wild. Tottenham's frustrations boiled over in six minutes of added time with Kane and Mason both booked for reckless challenges and unsavoury scenes continued at the final whistle, but it was Leicester's night and Ranieri had his former club to thank.

Sturridge could have pulled one back for the Reds instantly, as Sheyi Ojo played him in on the left, but his shot across the face of goal missed the net by inches. Cork celebrates his brilliant goal at the Liberty Stadium The second half started much like the first with very few chances to speak of, although Neil Taylor could have gifted Liverpool a goal as he turned an Ojo cross just past his own post in what was the best effort of any kind in the opening 15 minutes. The second-half goals came in quick succession with Benteke the first to score as he headed home from an Ojo corner to reduce the deficit and give Liverpool a glimmer of hope. However, Swansea restored their two-goal lead just minutes later as Ayew nabbed his second, taking advantage of some poor defending from Liverpool to coolly hit home through a sea of red shirts. Jefferson Montero tumbles under Nathaniel Clyne's challenge The afternoon got worse for the Reds as they ended the game with 10 men after Smith was shown a second yellow for a high challenge on Wayne Routledge, and Swansea could have had a fourth just minutes later as Angel Rangel smashed an effort into the side of the net. The rest of the game was seen out with relative ease by the hosts, with Sigurdsson failing to square the ball to Ayew for his hat-trick in the dying minutes and seeing his shot go wide - much to the dismay of the Ghanaian.

Martial (left) scored as Leicester were held to a draw at Old Trafford Leicester must wait to claim the Premier League title after being held to a 1-1 draw with Manchester United in a pulsating clash at Old Trafford. Needing victory on Sunday to claim the first top-flight title in their 132-year history, Claudio Ranieri's side started nervously and they were behind in the eighth minute after Anthony Martial's ninth league goal of the season. But the visitors showed the character that has underpinned their campaign so far, levelling the scores nine minutes later thanks to captain Wes Morgan's header. Wes Morgan admitted Leicester had to work very hard for a point against an in-form Manchester United Wes Morgan admitted Leicester had to work very hard for a point against an in-form Manchester United After the break, both sides continued to push forward in search of a winner as both Leonardo Ulloa and Riyad Mahrez went close, before Chris Smalling's header rattled the post with just over 10 minutes remaining. Leicester were forced to see out the game with 10 men after Danny Drinkwater received his marching orders in the 86th minute for a second bookable offence, but they did just that with the draw meaning they still need two points from games against Everton and Chelsea to guarantee the title. However, Ranieri's men could be crowned champions without kicking a ball if Tottenham fail to beat Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Monday Night Football. With Jamie Vardy still suspended, Ranieri stuck with the same side that won 4-0 at home to Swansea, but the visitors made the worst possible start and were made to pay when Antonio Valencia's cross reached Martial at the far post, and the Frenchman stroked the ball through the legs of Kasper Schmeichel. Anthony Martial celebrates putting Manchester United ahead United were brimming with confidence and continued to dominate, nearly doubling their advantage in the 15th minute but for a superb save from Schmeichel, who got down well to parry away Jesse Lingard's drilled shot after Marouane Fellaini's knock down. It proved to be a crucial save as two minutes later, Leicester were back on level terms as Morgan muscled his way through the United defence to head Drinkwater's free-kick across goal and past David de Gea into the far corner. Morgan levelled just nine minutes after the opener There was controversy in the 22nd minute, as Robert Huth appeared to grab Fellaini's hair and the Belgium international reacted by lashing out twice, once with his elbow and then with his hand. However, both escaped punishment after referee Michael Oliver missed the incident. Marouane Fellaini is seen elbowing Robert Huth in the face Oliver was back in the spotlight 10 minutes later when Danny Simpson gave away the ball away to Lingard on the halfway line. The winger looked to race through on goal but went to ground under the challenge of the Leicester full-back. Last man Simpson would surely have been sent off if the official had deemed the challenge a foul but he instead waved play on. Van Gaal says United should have been awarded a penalty when Robert Huth pulled Marouane Fellaini's hair in the box Van Gaal says United should have been awarded a penalty when Robert Huth pulled Marouane Fellaini's hair in the box And there was another big talking point in the 40th minute when Leicester appealed for a penalty. Goalkeeper De Gea was nearly caught out by Jeffrey Schlupp's cross, but the Spaniard managed to scramble back to parry the ball clear from under his crossbar. After Leicester's 1-1 draw, Claudio Ranieri offered some words of support to under-fire Man Utd manager Louis van Gaal After Leicester's 1-1 draw, Claudio Ranieri offered some words of support to under-fire Man Utd manager Louis van Gaal PFA Player of the Year Mahrez then picked up the rebound and as he looked to turn past Marcos Rojo, he was felled by the left-back, but no penalty was given. After the interval, Morgan continued to be a threat from set pieces, rising highest to meet Christian Fuchs' corner but his effort was easily gathered by De Gea. Marcos Rojo brings down Riyad Mahrez in the area, but nothing is given The end-to-end nature of the match continued, with Martial curling over but in the 52nd minute, Shinji Okazaki was inches away from giving his side into the lead after Simpson's cross flashed across goal. Chances were beginning to fall Leicester's way as Leonardo Ulloa twice went close, his first effort deflected wide before Lingard hacked the Argentine striker's header from the resultant corner away from goal. The pace of the game was ferocious as Schlupp raced down the left before centering for Okazaki, but De Gea was quickly off his line to thwart the latest Leicester attack. United threw on Juan Mata for Lingard in the 63rd minute but it was Leicester who continued to carve out the more clear-cut chances, with Ulloa heading another excellent Drinkwater set-piece just wide. Wayne Rooney felt United dominated the second half against Leicester and deserved to win Wayne Rooney felt United dominated the second half against Leicester and deserved to win Mahrez was next to test United's goalkeeper, cutting in from the right on his left foot before unleashing an effort on goal which De Gea punched to safety. Leicester started to look more and more jaded as the game went on which allowed United back into the contest, and Smalling went close, hitting the post with a header after being picked out at the far post by Rooney. The Super Sunday panel felt Leicester were fortunate not to have a penalty awarded against them The Super Sunday panel felt Leicester were fortunate not to have a penalty awarded against them Ranieri's men were forced to see out the game with 10 men after Drinkwater picked up his second yellow card for a foul on substitute Memphis Depay right on the edge of the penalty area with the home fans screaming for a penalty. But despite the numerical disadvantage, Leicester held on to inch closer to a historic Premier League crown, which could now be sealed as early as Monday night.

The Saints raced into a two-goal lead inside half an hour at St Mary's as Shane Long and Mane struck, before Kelechi Iheanacho headed City back into the game just before half-time. Jose Fonte felt Southampton's third goal made all the difference, as Man City had made a strong start to the second half Jose Fonte felt Southampton's third goal made all the difference, as Man City had made a strong start to the second half But Mane netted twice more after the break to leave City looking over their shoulders again in the race for the top four. They are now just four points ahead of Manchester United with two league fixtures left to play, while Louis van Gaal's side have a game in hand. Southampton, meanwhile, climbed back above Liverpool into seventh, boosting their hopes of Europa League qualification in the process. One bright spark for City, however, was the performance of Iheanacho, who netted a stunning late consolation to make it four goals in two games for him on an otherwise dreadful day for the away side. Mane completes his hat-trick against Manchester City Manuel Pellegrini made eight changes to his side with Real Madrid in midweek in mind, and it showed in their disjointed performance for most of the first half. Time and time again City conspired to lose the ball in dangerous areas, with Fernandinho and Fabian Delph particularly culpable, and only a lack of incision in the final third stopped Southampton from taking the lead sooner. Graeme Souness says Manchester City have let down their supporters this season and the players deserve extreme criticism for their display at Southampton Graeme Souness says Manchester City have let down their supporters this season and the players deserve extreme criticism for their display at Southampton After 25 minutes, though, they did make it 1-0, and it was a fine move as Cuco Martina pinged a ball into Dusan Tadic over the top, before he pulled it back into the path of Long. There was still work for the Irishman to do, with a few yards to make up on Nicolas Otamendi, but Long simply wanted it more and beat the City defender to the ball before poking it past Joe Hart. Southampton were head and shoulders above Man City on Sunday And less than three minutes later, Hart was beaten again. This time, a fine counter-attack saw Victor Wanyama pick out Tadic, who waited and waited before threading a fine pass into the path of the onrushing Mane, who slammed it home at the first time of asking. City were sorely lacking going forward, with the likes of Raheem Sterling and Wilfried Bony struggling to make an impression, but on the stroke of half-time they managed to get a foothold in the game through Iheanacho. Manuel Pellegrini admitted he made eight changes with Man City's Champions League semi-final in mind, but the replacements did not defend well Manuel Pellegrini admitted he made eight changes with Man City's Champions League semi-final in mind, but the replacements did not defend well The 19-year-old forward, starting his second Premier League game in a row after netting two against Stoke last week, pounced to head home from six yards out after Samir Nasri's ball in had ricocheted off a couple of Southampton defenders and fallen into his path. It was a lifeline City scarcely warranted, and Saints deservedly restored their two-goal lead in the 57th minute as Mane netted from close range after Virgil van Dijk's header from a corner had crashed off the bar - via the top of Hart's head. Mane was named Man of the Match for his display And 11 minutes later, he completed his hat-trick, again latching onto a Tadic pass before firing low inside the near post from just inside the area. There was more drama to come, however, as Iheanacho added a fine second for himself and City with a goal that deserved far more than just consolation status. Ronald Koeman feels Southampton can qualify for Europe and beat last season's points tally Ronald Koeman feels Southampton can qualify for Europe and beat last season's points tally The Nigerian picked up Jesus Navas' pass just inside the area, before taking a touch and curling an absolute peach past the helpless Fraser Forster and into the top corner. City still had 11 minutes to find their way back in, but never really threatened again, and Pellegrini and Co will hope to forget about this one as soon as possible before attention turns to Wednesday night and the Bernabeu.

Baines struck the winning goal against Bournemouth Everton left-back Leighton Baines scored the winner against Bournemouth to give Roberto Martinez a much-needed 2-1 win at Goodison Park on Saturday. Baines struck the decisive goal of the game in the 64th minute, rattling home Aaron Lennon's low pass to consign the visitors to a fifth defeat in six games. Tom Cleverley had earlier opened the scoring for Everton after only eight minutes but saw his strike instantly cancelled out by a Marc Pugh equaliser. Bournemouth pushed hard for an equaliser in the closing stages but never really extended Tim Howard, who was named captain on his penultimate Goodison Park appearance. Charlie Nicholas gives his reaction to Everton's 2-1 win over Bournemouth. Charlie Nicholas gives his reaction to Everton's 2-1 win over Bournemouth. But despite winning the game, several supporters remained behind after full-time and held up banners requesting Martinez's removal and his future will remain in doubt despite this narrow victory, only Everton's fifth of the season at home. Baines celebrates scoring the winner At one point a sign was flown over the ground stating it was \"time to go Roberto\" and the home side's performance in the first half will have done little to change the minds of disgruntled supporters. Eddie Howe felt his Bournemouth team looked the better side for long periods of the game against Everton Eddie Howe felt his Bournemouth team looked the better side for long periods of the game against Everton The goals which the period brought were separated by barely a minute and were the only real entertainment in a first half dominated by seemingly endless Everton possession but no cutting edge. The home side had almost 64 per cent of possession in that time and managed just two shots on target as they adopted a slow and - at times - tedious approach. Cleverley's goal came after the midfielder took a superb first touch to take his marker out of the game and steer a low shot inside Artur Boruc's left-hand post. Everton held a tribute to the 96 Liverpool fans who lost their lives in the Hillsborough disaster before their game with Bournemouth Everton held a tribute to the 96 Liverpool fans who lost their lives in the Hillsborough disaster before their game with Bournemouth But almost immediately, Bournemouth were level after Callum Wilson beat Premier League debutant Matthew Pennington to the ball - amid strong Everton appeals for a foul - before delivering a cross which found Marc Pugh, who bundled a shot underneath Howard. Bournemouth had the next good chance of the game when Matt Ritchie saw his snapshot from the edge of the box well blocked after a marauding Charlie Daniels run from left-back and Ross Barkley forced Boruc into a point-blank save with his chest after exchanging passes with Oumar Niasse. Tom Cleverley opened the scoring at Goodison Park The second half was a much more open affair, partly because both teams tired, and partly because Bournemouth adopted an attacking outlook after going behind to Baines' goal. The full-back took it in the style of a seasoned striker, powering home a first-time shot after Lennon's cross had evaded everyone else. Bournemouth were energised by the introduction of substitutes Junior Stanislas and Benik Afobe but the latter spurned the visitors' best chance of the game when he diverted a header over from a fine Wilson cross 12 minutes from time. Everton had, to the nostalgic delight of their supporters, put on Tony Hibbert as a second-half substitute for his first appearance in 16 months, and there was a glimpse of the future as well as the past when 18-year-old forward Kieran Dowell was given a late cameo. Matthew Pennington was on cloud nine after he made his debut in Everton's 2-1 win over Bournemouth. Matthew Pennington was on cloud nine after he made his debut in Everton's 2-1 win over Bournemouth. Martinez has this week spoken of his faith in the club's emerging younger players but it remains to be seen if the manager will be given the chance to oversee their first-team development in the long term. Soccer Saturday verdict - Charlie Nicholas It was such a classy start what Everton did with the 'Justice for 96', but it was flat after that because everyone is waiting for this Everton team to excite them the way they did earlier in the season - and that didn't quite materialise. It got a lot better for them in the second half. Bournemouth were hard done by. I thought they played well again today. All round, Roberto Martinez will be delighted and I will point out that the protestors waited right until the end. They didn't have them during the game. They sat and were quiet and right at the final whistle a lot of them stayed to protest against Martinez and unfortunately, and I think wrongly, against Bill Kenwright. Roberto Martinez said his Everton side showed togetherness and character in their 2-1 win over Bournemouth.

Newcastle United goalkeeper Karl Darlow saved a penalty from Crystal Palace's Yohan Cabaye The victory, combined with dropped points for their relegation rivals, sees Newcastle climb to 17th, one point clear of Sunderland and two clear of Norwich, albeit having played a game more than both.

Newcastle players celebrate with Andros Townsend after his goal in the second half The home fans grew increasingly frustrated with perceived time-wasting from the visitors from as early as the half-hour mark, but didn't have to wait long to watch their side go in front after the interval. Townsend had been a growing influence on the game, and when he won a free-kick 25 yards from goal, the winger stepped up to curl past Wayne Hennessey. Andros Townsend curled his free-kick past Palace 'keeper Wayne Hennessey It was his fourth league goal since joining from Tottenham in January, beating his total of three scored in 50 appearances for Spurs.

Andros Townsend celebrates after scoring the only goal of the game at St James' Park Soccer Saturday verdict - Paul Merson It was very edgy. Newcastle didn't start very well and the better team in the first half was definitely Crystal Palace. But what a goal from Townsend. It looked like Newcastle were going to run away with it until the penalty out of nothing. A great save from Darlow and that was it really. They held their nerve after that. It's a massive, massive three points. The thing I like about Townsend is he always gets on the ball. Some of his passing in the first half wasn't great, but he always gets on the ball and that's what you need at Newcastle.

"report": "Sunderland celebrate their injury-time leveller Jermain Defoe scored a penalty in the final minute of stoppage-time as relegation-threatened Sunderland salvaged a dramatic 1-1 draw against Stoke on Saturday. Desperate for points to boost their survival hopes, the Black Cats struggled to create clear-cut chances and it looked like Marko Arnautovic's second-half goal would consign them to defeat. But, with time running out, Defoe won and calmly converted a penalty after a lengthy delay to keep the Sunderland fans dreaming of survival. Matt Le Tissier gives his reaction to Sunderland's last gasp 1-1 draw with Stoke Matt Le Tissier gives his reaction to Sunderland's last gasp 1-1 draw with Stoke Newcastle's home win over Crystal Palace means Sunderland drop into the bottom three, but they have a game in hand over the Magpies. Sunderland fielded the same starting line-up for the fifth match in a row while Stoke made five changes, having shipped four goals in each of their three previous games. Mark Hughes recalled forward Peter Crouch who proved to be the key man in the first half as his aerial prowess caused the Sunderland defence ceaseless problems. Peter Crouch caused the Sunderland defence problems throughout The former England man drew a one-handed save from Vito Mannone with a header before nodding another chance just wide of the post. But it was top-scorer Arnautovic who squandered the best opportunity of the half, blazing a shot over the crossbar after a Giannelli Imbula pass had put him in on goal with plenty of time to pick his spot. Worryingly for Sunderland, despite the best efforts of Defoe and the lively Patrick van Aanholt, chances were thin on the ground for the visitors, and they found themselves a goal down five minutes into the second half. Marko Arnautovic fired Stoke into the lead Crouch nodded down a Charlie Adam cross and Arnautovic was far more composed his time, waiting patiently as Lamine Kone failed to cut the ball out before thumping a left-footed shot into the net. Arnautovic was withdrawn with an injury and the goal sparked some life out of Sunderland, Defoe shooting just over after cutting inside and later trying an acrobatic volley which also went over the top. But Stoke also had chances to finish the game off, Mannone doing well to bravely foil Crouch after substitute Jon Walters had nodded the ball into the danger area. Jermain Defoe secured a point from the penalty spot late in Sunderland's 1-1 draw against Stoke Jermain Defoe secured a point from the penalty spot late in Sunderland's 1-1 draw against Stoke The hosts had an even better chance in stoppage-time, a lovely Crouch flick and a neat Walters pass putting Imbula through, but the midfielder was somewhat slow to move forward and, when he eventually got a shot away, it was just wide of the post. Sunderland's race appeared to be run at this point however, and it did not look like the wasted chance would prove costly, but Defoe had other ideas. Defoe salvaged a point with a late penalty With just seconds remaining, the experienced forward twisted and turned in the box, before going down under pressure from Geoff Cameron. Referee Craig Pawson pointed to the spot and, despite a delay before the kick could be taken, Defoe confidently found the right-hand corner as Jakob Haugaard flung himself in the opposite direction. The Black Cats and their travelling army celebrated the point jubilantly and they move on to play host to Chelsea next Saturday. Peter Crouch made only his third Premier League start of the season. Peter Crouch made only his third Premier League start of the season. Soccer Saturday verdict - Matt Le Tissier I don't think I ever took a penalty so late at such a crucial stage of the season. It is butterflies-in-the-stomach time, but fair play to Defoe, who looked cool, calm and collected when it was given. The finish was very good, sending the goalkeeper the wrong way. There was no question about the penalty award, for me. I thought Stoke were the better side in terms of quality and Sunderland looked nervous which is understandable at this stage of the season. Fair play to them for digging in. Big Sam [Allardyce] made some substitutions and they got the break in the end with the penalty. Mark Hughes was disappointed not to get back to winning ways.

"report": "Troy Deeney won it for Watford with two late goals A late double from Troy Deeney handed Watford a dramatic 3-2 win over already-relegated Aston Villa in the Premier League on Saturday. The Birmingham City fan scored in the 90th and 93rd minute against 10-men Villa to hand Watford all three points despite a much-improved show from the Premier League's bottom side. Villa took the lead just before the half-hour mark through Ciaran Clark's strong header from a corner, before Almen Abdi equalised with a superb free-kick on the stroke of half-time. Jordan Ayew scored Villa's second at Vicarage Road But Villa regained the lead three minutes after the break through Jordan Ayew's fine finish from 20 yards, though the visitors had to play the final stages with 10 men after Aly Cissokho's dismissal before Deeney's late double. The result leaves Watford in 12th place on 44 points, handing them only their second league win in nine games, while Villa have now lost their last 11 league games, equalling an unwanted club record. Watford made four changes from the side that lost 2-1 to Crystal Palace in the FA Cup semi-final last weekend, while Villa made three, handing teenage defender Kevin Toner his first start. Villa players celebrate Ciaran Clark's goal in the first half After a slow start, Mark Bunn saved well down low from Odion Ighalo's effort from an acute angle on the left, before Ben Watson's fine touch and volley from 30 yards hit the crossbar. Troy Deeney scored twice late-on to secure a 3-2 win against Aston Villa. Troy Deeney scored twice late-on to secure a 3-2 win against Aston Villa. Villa took the lead moments later through Republic of Ireland defender Clark, who got a good connection on Ashley Westwood's drilled corner to head into the ground and past Heurelho Gomes. The visitors were nearly 2-0 up minutes before the break through Ayew, who saw his diving header from 12 yards come off the near post and clear, but Watford were soon level. Almen Abdi celebrates equalising from a free-kick on the stroke of half-time After winning the free-kick from Idrissa Gueye's foul, Abdi curled the ball into the bottom left corner from 25 yards past the dive of Bunn. Villa were ahead again on 48 minutes, Ayew converting into the bottom left corner from 20 yards after a fine one-two with Rudy Gestede on the edge of the box. Gestede should have made it 3-1 moments later, but blazed over the bar from 12 yards after Westwood's lay-off, while at the other end Clark cleared Deeney's header from a corner off the line. Almen Abdi competes for the ball against Leandro Bacuna (R) and Idrissa Gana (L) Eric Black's Villa came close twice in quick succession through Toner's header and Gestede's blocked shot, but they were reduced to 10 men after Cissokho's cynical last-man foul on Ikechi Anya. They looked to have held on until the 90th minute, when Deeney got in between Villa's centre-backs to glance a header into the bottom left corner from Steven Berghuis' right-wing cross. And Deeney, who scored in the return fixture at Villa Park, won it for Watford with a fine curling finish into the bottom corner as the ball broke to him on the edge of the area.

team's second goal against West Brom at The Hawthorns Mark Noble scored twice as West Ham continued their push for European football next season with a comfortable 3-0 Premier League win at West Brom on Saturday. West Brom started the brighter of the two sides but they were made to pay for missed chances when Cheikhou Kouyate headed Dimitri Payet's inch-perfect cross past Ben Foster in the 34th minute. The visitors doubled their advantage in injury time of the first half as Kouyate's pass found Noble in the penalty area and the Hammers skipper showed good composure to find the far corner with his right-footed shot. After the break, West Ham extended their advantage and it was Noble again, volleying Andy Carroll's cross into the roof of the net to score his fourth goal in two games. Victory moves Slaven Bilic's side, who are unbeaten in 10 matches the league, above Manchester United into fifth, but Louis van Gaal's side will reclaim fifth spot if they avoid defeat against title-chasing Leicester on Super Sunday.

West Brom handed a first Premier League start to Jonathan Leko, who became the first player born in 1999 to start a top-flight game. The 17-year-old made an early impact, bursting past Aaron Cresswell before pulling the ball back for Craig Gardner, whose first-time effort was blocked by Winston Reid. The midfielder latched onto the rebound but was denied again, this time by a smart save from Adrian. West Brom had the better of the opening exchanges and in the 14th minute they created another opening for Gardner, who curled a shot towards the far corner. The ball looked destined for the back of the net until Michail Antonio intervened to deflect the ball wide. Cheikhou Kouyate celebrates his opener at West Brom Leko was again in involved in the 23rd minute, leaving Cresswell behind again before firing a dangerous, low cross in the penalty area, forcing Adrian into a block at his near post. The ball fell to Gardner but this time he failed to hit the target, heading wide at the back post. West Brom boss Tony Pulis was left frustrated at the chances his side missed in their defeat to West Ham. West Brom boss Tony Pulis was left frustrated at the chances his side missed in their defeat to West Ham. And Tony Pulis' side were made to pay for their missed chances in the 34th minute as the ball broke to Payet on the right flank after Reid's tackle, and the France international picked out the perfect cross to find Kouyate, who headed the ball back across goal and into the bottom corner. Their lead was extended in added time and Kouyate was involved again, racing into the area to tee up Noble, who survived a poor first touch to stab the ball into the corner. Noble (centre) celebrates scoring his sides second goal of the game Pulis attempted to turn things around with Saido Berahino and Sandro replacing James McClean and Claudio Yacob, but the hosts continued to miss chances. Salomon Rondon's weak header was easily gathered by Adrian, before Berahino missed a glorious chance on 64 minutes after being teed up by his strike partner. Berahino had been on the pitch for less than 90 seconds when Rondon cushioned a cross into his path, but he could only drag his effort wide from 15 yards. West Brom's Jonathan Leko says he was shocked to make his debut for the club in their defeat to West Ham.

Fellow substitute Sandro shot wide but West Ham wrapped up the victory with 11 minutes remaining when Noble scored his second. Payet ran at the heart of the West Brom defence before releasing Carroll to cross for Noble, who adjusted his body to smash a 10-yard volley into the roof of the net to ensure West Ham continue their charge towards European qualification next season. Kouyate (left) and Darren Fletcher battle for the ball at The Hawthorns Soccer Saturday verdict - Phil Thompson I think 3-0 was maybe a bit harsh on West Brom. In the first 25 minutes it was all West Brom and West Ham couldn't get into the game. Young Jonathan Leko - remember his name - was giving Aaron Cresswell an absolute nightmare. But in the end it was a very, very good win. West Ham boss Slaven Bilic says his side were 'really good' in their 3-0 win at West Brom.

The Albion centre-back put Spurs in front with an own goal on 33 minutes, squeezing the ball into his own net under pressure from Jan Vertonghen at a free-kick. Dele Alli could face retrospective action after appearing to hit Claudio Yacob The hosts failed to convert a number of good chances, hitting the woodwork three times, and Dawson punished them with 18 minutes left when he rose above Eric Dier and Hugo Lloris to head home from a corner. It means league leaders Leicester are just one win from the title, with three games left, and can clinch the trophy with victory over Manchester United at Old Trafford on Super Sunday. Spurs could also be without Dele Alli, who may face retrospective action from the FA after he was filmed hitting out at Claudio Yacob and striking him in the stomach, off the ball and unseen by referee Mike Jones. Tottenham dominated the first half, keeping the Baggies pinned back in their own defensive third, and Albion goalkeeper Boaz Myhill was forced to make two excellent saves within the first 10 minutes. Jan Vertonghen celebrated but it was an own goal by Dawson that gave Spurs the lead After Christian Eriksen went close with a free-kick, Myhill tipped a low Harry Kane effort onto the far post before punching away Toby Alderweireld's awkward cross-shot that could have found the net. Harry Kane admits the 1-1 draw is a blow but insists Spurs will keep fighting for the title Harry Kane admits the 1-1 draw is a blow but insists Spurs will keep fighting for the title Eriksen then hit the crossbar on 13 minutes with another sweetly-struck set-piece that was aimed at the top right-hand corner, and then Myhill saved well again from Kane low down on 20 minutes. Tony Pulis was pleased with the work rate and organisation of his West Brom side Tony Pulis was pleased with the work rate and organisation of his West Brom side Spurs were finally helped into the lead by Dawson when Eriksen's free-kick deep into the penalty area went underneath Myhill via the defender's body, with Vertonghen celebrating as if he had scored his first league goal in since March 2013. Mauricio Pochettino was disappointed to see his title-chasing Tottenham side spurn so many chances Mauricio Pochettino was disappointed to see his title-chasing Tottenham side spurn so many chances The home side still seemed in control as Erik Lamela hit the post from Eriksen's low cross on 58 minutes and then went close through the Denmark international on 65, but they grew frustrated with themselves as the game wore on and their usual strengths began to drop. Passing accuracy decreased, West Brom had more possession, and Tottenham failed to win the ball back as often. Salomon Rondon gave them a stern warning with a shot from a tight angle that Lloris had to tip over the bar. Dawson headed home West Brom's equaliser on 73 minutes And it was the France number one who was arguably to blame for the equaliser as he came to claim the resulting corner but failed to beat Dawson to the ball, and the defender found the net from six yards. Craig Gardner and Darren Fletcher give their reactions after West Brom claimed a point at the Lane Craig Gardner and Darren Fletcher give their reactions after West Brom claimed a point at the Lane Tottenham looked shocked and deflated and struggled to create a chance in the final moments. They dropped to the turf as the final whistle was blown, knowing their title hopes have begun to fade.

climb out of relegation zone, Gunners fail to reclaim third Laurent Koscielny battles Sunderland's Jermain Defoe for the ball at the Stadium of Light Sunderland climbed out of the relegation zone and pegged Arsenal back after a goalless draw at the Stadium of Light on Sunday. Both sides had penalty shouts turned down in the first half, as referee Mike Dean waved away appeals from Jermain Defoe and Alex Iwobi. Patrick van Aanholt went closest to breaking the deadlock when his free-kick hit the post, while former Arsenal goalkeeper Vito Mannone made several impressive saves to preserve his clean sheet. Jermain Defoe appealed for a penalty after Per Mertesacker blocked his shot Jack Wilshere came off the bench in the closing stages for Arsenal, making his first appearance since the 2015 FA Cup final. The draw moves Sunderland above Norwich City on goal difference into 17th, while Arsenal remain fourth on 64 points, level with third-placed Manchester City and now only five points clear of Manchester United having played a game more. Both teams were unchanged from recent victories, but it was the visitors who carved out the first opening when Iwobi fired a yard wide after quick feet on the edge of the box. Arsene Wenger named an unchanged Arsenal team from their victory over West Brom But Sunderland grew into the game, with Wahbi Khazri and Lee Cattermole both going close before Van Aanholt struck Petr Cech's post with a curling free-kick. And the hosts felt they should have had a penalty when Defoe's first-time shot struck Per Mertesacker on the arm, but referee Dean ignored their protest. Jermain Defoe says Sunderland should have been awarded a penalty but insists he is happy with a crucial point Jermain Defoe says Sunderland should have been awarded a penalty but insists he is happy with a crucial point The official did the same to Arsenal just before half-time, when Iwobi appealed for handball after his strike hit the covering DeAndre Yedlin on the arm. Mannone kept his former club out with a smart save from Alexis Sanchez's free-kick, while the Chilean also had a header cleared off the line in an entertaining first half. Defoe tested Cech with a stinging volley five minutes after the break, and the Arsenal 'keeper was alive to keep out Yann M'Vila's scuffed follow-up. He was called into action again by Khazri, while down the other end Iwobi miscued his volley after good work by Oliver Giroud. Arsene Wenger says it was disappointing Arsenal did not take their chances Arsene Wenger says it was disappointing Arsenal did not take their chances The Arsenal striker, who has now extended his longest league run without a goal to 14 games, endured a frustrating afternoon and was replaced by Danny Welbeck with 20 minutes to play. Defoe looked most likely for Sunderland and after beating Mertesacker in a foot-race, the striker saw his chip drop wide of Cech's goal with the goalkeeper beaten. Sam Allardyce also named an unchanged Sunderland team But he wasted the chance to present Fabio Borini with a tap-in when Laurent Koscielny cut out his square pass after Khazri's through ball. And Mannone breathed a sigh of relief after misjudging a clearing header outside his box, as Younes Kaboul bailed out his 'keeper by dispossessing Welbeck.

Leicester's third goal Leonardo Ulloa scored twice to help inspire Leicester to a comfortable 4-0 victory over Swansea at the King Power Stadium and move Claudio Ranieri's side a step closer to the Premier League title. In the absence of top goalscorer Jamie Vardy, Ulloa led the line to great effect scoring either side of half-time as the hosts went eight points clear of nearest rivals Tottenham at the top of the Premier League table. Riyad Mahrez set Leicester on their way in the 10th minute after intercepting Ashley Williams' poor pass, before firing a low shot into the bottom corner. The Algeria international, who alongside team-mates Vardy and N'Golo Kante is up for the PFA Player of the Year on Sunday evening, then helped the hosts double their advantage in the 30th minute, sending in an inch-perfect free-kick for Ulloa to head past Lukasz Fabianski. Riyad Mahrez celebrates opening the scoring against Swansea Ulloa added a third on the hour mark, tapping home Jeffrey Schlupp's pass to score his third goal in two games before substitute Marc Albrighton rounded off proceedings in the 85th minute to help record Leicester's biggest win of the season. Victory means Leicester need just five points from their remaining three matches to claim the title ahead of Tottenham, who play West Brom on Monday Night Football. Speculation was rife before kick-off as to who Claudio Ranieri would turn to in place of the suspended Vardy and it was last week's penalty hero Ulloa who got the nod. Ulloa and Mahrez praised Leicester's 4-0 win against Swansea Ulloa and Mahrez praised Leicester's 4-0 win against Swansea Ranieri, who had only made 25 changes to his starting 11 all season before kick-off, sprung another change with Jeffrey Schlupp replacing Albrighton. With the title well within Leicester's grasp, there were plenty of nerves around the ground before kick-off and it showed on the pitch in the second minute as Wayne Routledge swung a cross into the Leicester penalty area with the outside of his boot, but the unmarked Andre Ayew could not get on the end of it. Mahrez opened the scoring in the 10th minute However, just eight minutes later, all the nerves had disappeared thanks to a horrendous error from Williams. The Swansea skipper's woeful pass was easily intercepted by Mahrez, and the Algerian showed his composure to cut back onto his right foot and fire past Fabianski for his 17th goal of the season. Mahrez was certainly stepping up in the absence of Vardy, taking his side forward at every opportunity and the forward did brilliantly in the 27th minute to create space for a shot, but his drilled effort was well blocked. Leon Britton says Swansea were very disappointed with their performance Leon Britton says Swansea were very disappointed with their performance From the resulting corner, the loose ball dropped to Christian Fuchs, but the full-back's acrobatic effort was easily saved by Fabianksi. Leicester were in the ascendancy and they made it count when Mahrez's inch-perfect free-kick was headed in expertly by Ulloa in the 30th minute. Ulloa heads in Leicester's second goal The King Power Stadium was rocking but just two minutes later Swansea showed they were still a threat with Federico Fernandez heading just over and Gylfi Sigurdsson forcing Kasper Schmeichel into a smart save low down to his right. Francesco Guidolin threw on Jefferson Montero and Alberto Paloschi in place of Routledge and Leroy Fer as Swansea came out with renewed vigour after the break, but the final pass was still letting the visitors down. Leroy Fer and N'golo Kante battle for the ball The wind was finally taken out of Swansea's sails on the hour mark when Schlupp nipped the ball around Angel Rangel before attempting to square the ball to Ulloa. The pass was blocked but luckily for Schlupp the ball rebounded to him and at the second attempt he picked out Ulloa, who tapped into an empty net. The Foxes started to turn on the style with Schlupp, buoyed by his assist, powering an effort towards the bottom corner in the 66th minute, but Fabianski got across well to make an excellent save. Shinji Okazaki was next to go close for the hosts, picking up the loose ball just inside the penalty area, before firing his effort over the crossbar. Claudio Ranieri says Leicester gave a fantastic performance in their 4-0 win against Swansea Claudio Ranieri says Leicester gave a fantastic performance in their 4-0 win against Swansea With Ulloa's back seemingly stiffening up, Ranieri, who could be without Vardy for next week's trip to Manchester United, took no chances, replacing the striker with Andy King for the final 12 minutes. The substitute had not one, but two chances to score in quick succession after going clear through on goal, but the Welshman was denied by Fabianski before curling an effort over the crossbar. Riyad Mahrez celebrates with his team-mates after opening the Swansea It was to be another substitute to round of proceedings for the home side as Albrighton, on for the impressive Schlupp, powered the ball into the roof of the net to secure Leicester's joint biggest win in the Premier League and move them ever closer to a first Premier League title in the club's history.

Fernando opened the scoring at the Etihad Stadium - somewhat against the run of play - after 35 minutes, before Sergio Aguero converted from the penalty spot eight minutes later to double the hosts' advantage. After winning the penalty in the first half, the impressive Iheanacho got in on the act himself after the interval, making sure of the victory with two expertly-taken goals on 64 and 74 minutes to seal a comfortable victory ahead of Tuesday's Champions League date with Real Madrid. Sergio Aguero celebrates after scoring Manchester City's second The result sees City leapfrog Arsenal into third - until the Gunners play on Sunday at least - and open up a five-point gap over bitter rivals Manchester United in fifth, while Stoke remain ninth after another disappointing display. The beginning of the game lacked any real intensity, with City struggling to find their rhythm in front of their subdued fans. Stoke carved out a few half-chances, with Joselu missing the best of them, heading wide when picked out well by a smart Mirko Arnautovic cross. Giannelli Imbula (left) tussles with David Silva However, as soon as City took the lead on 35 minutes, they gained control. Jesus Navas did brilliantly to win the corner, delivered it himself, and picked out the run of Fernando, who glanced his header into the corner. Eight minutes later it was two, but Mark Hughes will be unhappy that it was more than avoidable. Iheanacho darted into the box, bamboozled Ryan Shawcross with some fleet-footed skills, before being tugged to the ground by the Stoke skipper. Aguero stepped up to take the penalty, at the same end he missed against Paris Saint-Germain, but this time converted with consummate ease. After the break, Stoke looked to take the game to City, as Manuel Pellegrini's men took their foot off the gas too early. Phil Bardsley vies for the ball with Silva at the Etihad Joselu missed a great chance to get his side back it after being picked out superbly by Arnautovic, but he fired wide with the goal at his mercy. Then, as City sat too deep and invited pressure, Arnautovic created an opportunity out of nothing for himself, beating Pablo Zabaleta all ends up, only to be denied by a brilliant stop from Joe Hart. Jesus Navas attempts to challenge Stoke goalkeeper Shay Given The Potters would live to rue those missed opportunities, as City made sure of the three points with a swift goal on the counter after 64 minutes. Navas was again at the heart of it, delaying his pass superbly, before laying the ball into the path of the onrushing Zabaleta, who pulled it back for Iheanacho to score his 10th goal of the season. Manuel Pellegrini hailed the performance of Kelechi Iheanacho Manuel Pellegrini hailed the performance of Kelechi Iheanacho The rest of the match was a mere training exercise for Pellegrini's men, but they put further gloss on the win with Iheanacho latching onto Wilfried Bony's through-ball, before rounding Stoke substitute goalkeeper Jakob Haugaard and slotting home. The only slight sore point for City fans was the injury Yaya Toure sustained towards the end of the match, which could make him a doubt for their midweek Champions League semi-final. Glenn Whelan says there can be no excuses following Stoke's 4-0 defeat Glenn Whelan says there can be no excuses following Stoke's 4-0 defeat Despite their relatively impressive campaign, Mark Hughes will not be enamoured by the fact that Stoke are now the first side since Wigan in 2010 to concede four goals in three successive matches.

Villa - now a game away from equalling their club record losing streak of 11 from 1962-63 - made two changes from the side that lost 1-0 at Manchester United last Saturday, while Saints made four and gave a start to striker Jay Rodriguez, his first in the Premier League since September. Villa's Jordan Ayew battles with Oriol Romeu in midfield It was Long, another of those replacements, who caused the problems early on, hitting the bar from 10 yards after getting the better of Joleon Lescott, who bore the brunt of the Villa fans' anger. \"You're not fit to wear the shirt\" rang out at Villa Park, and the home fans soon saw their side go one down thanks to former West Brom striker Long, who headed home unmarked from six yards after Ryan Bertrand's superb left-wing ball. Villa fans made their feelings known about the club's current situation Villa went close at the other end through Leandro Bacuna, who headed wide from Westwood's cross from the right, before Saints hit the woodwork again through Virgil van Dijk after the Dutchman cut inside in the area and drilled an effort towards the near post. Westwood's close-range effort fell into the grateful hands of Fraser Forster moments later, but it was 2-0 to Southampton on 39 minutes thanks to Tadic's simple finish.

Ronald Koeman was satisfied with Southampton's 4-2 win Ronald Koeman was satisfied with Southampton's 4-2 win Guzan stood tall to deny Long just before the hour mark after Tadic's superb through ball, and it was the Serbian midfielder who scored Saints' third with a low deflected effort off the boot of Westwood from just outside the area.

Gestede came on for Ayew, surprisingly, and the crowd were absolutely furious, because Ayew has probably been one of the best ones. I think he must have got an injury or something like that. \"But it was a canter for Southampton. Shane Long was in acres of space to score the first, it was incredible, and I think the second goal caps everything for this Villa side. Bacuna makes a pass back into his own half and Long then gets past Joleon Lescott. It was shocking! These are the things which Villa have had to put up with up.

Bournemouth would not lie down, however, and they were back in the game less than two minutes later as a neat corner routine saw Simon Francis whip a cross in for Elphick, the skipper rising highest in the area to head into the ground and over Asmir Begovic for his first ever Premier League goal. Cesc Fabregas urged Chelsea to finish the season with pride Cesc Fabregas urged Chelsea to finish the season with pride They had a chance to level in the 38th minute as Grabban raced in behind John Obi Mikel - who was being played out of position at centre-back - before forcing a decent stop from Begovic. Pedro then wasted a glorious opportunity on the stroke of half-time to add his second and Chelsea's third, but somehow failed to hit the target after again being played in behind Bournemouth's defence by Fabregas. Willian added a third for Chelsea in the second half After such a frantic first half there was far less goalmouth action in the second, at least not until Chelsea put the game beyond doubt with 19 minutes to go. Guus Hiddink was pleased with Chelsea's performance Guus Hiddink was pleased with Chelsea's performance Bournemouth again left Fabregas with too much space, and the Spaniard slipped Willian in behind, before he took a touch and dinked the ball over Boruc. Eddie Howe felt Bournemouth lost their way in the second half Eddie Howe felt Bournemouth lost their way in the second half The goal completely flattened Bournemouth, who had thrown on Callum Wilson and Benik Afobe in the hopes of pulling level, and Hazard netted again in the first minute of stoppage time. Fabregas was at the heart of it once more as his superb flick allowed Nemanja Matic to break into the Bournemouth box and pull one back into the six-yard box for Hazard to tuck home. Willian celebrates with Cesc Fabregas after scoring his sides third goal Paul Merson's Soccer Saturday verdict \"Hazard was very good. He fancied it today and it was like the old Hazard of last season. He was lively on the ball, he was sharp. When he got it, he always wanted to have a go at players. \"And Fabregas was outstanding. His range of passing was absolutely phenomenal. \"They were never out of the game, Bournemouth. They kept going, King had the beating of the centre-halves, and Elphick scored with a header \"But, second half, Chelsea turned it up another gear and, when you watch this, their attacking stuff is different class. I think they need defenders, especially if they are not giving John Terry a new deal. \"No qualms with Bournemouth, their fans should be very proud of them. They gave as good as they got and Begovic made some good saves. Their job is done and they have to plan for next season and make sure they stay up.\" Player ratings Bournemouth: Boruc (4), Francis (4), Cook (4), Elphick (5), Daniels (4), Stanislas (5), Gosling

from two goals down to draw 2-2 at Liverpool and earn a potentially vital point in their fight against Premier League relegation. The hosts were without defender Mamadou Sakho following the pre-match announcement that he is being investigated by UEFA for a possible anti-doping violation. However, they looked to be on their way to a comfortable victory as Daniel Sturridge scored after just 68 seconds and Adam Lallana added a fine second on the half-hour mark. Colback's strike ended Newcastle's run of nine consecutive away defeats But Newcastle battled back impressively after the break, with Papiss Cisse heading home a few minutes after the restart and Jack Colback equalising with a deflected shot after 66 minutes. While the Magpies could not go on to grab a winner, the point moves them level with Sunderland and one point behind 17th-placed Norwich. Although Sunderland have two games in hand on the Magpies and the Canaries have one, Benitez will be buoyed by his side's battling display after they looked to be out of the game at half-time. Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp and former Anfield manager Rafa Benitez share a pre-match moment The Spaniard received a warm reception on his return to Anfield, where he won the Champions League and FA Cup during a six-year spell in charge from 2004-2010. Liverpool are also gunning for European glory this season and perhaps with one eye on the Europa League semi-final against Villarreal on Thursday, Jurgen Klopp made five changes to his side, with Philippe Coutinho dropped to the substitutes' bench. Moussa Sissoko of Newcastle makes a challenge on Adam Lallana Newcastle stuck with the same starting XI that drew against Manchester City in midweek, but they found themselves behind after 68 seconds as Sturridge chested down a long ball, turned and then fired into the bottom corner. Having scored four goals in their previous three matches at Anfield, the hosts were brimming with confidence and Roberto Firmino had a shot blocked before Sturridge fired over from distance. Daniel Sturridge celebrates his early opener for Liverpool against Newcastle Newcastle offered little at the other end and they fell further behind after half an hour when Lallana curled home a fine shot from just outside the box. It could have been worse for the visitors had Chancel Mbemba not made a good recovery tackle to deny Firmino a shooting chance before penalty appeals for handball against Paul Dummett were waved away. Colback rescued what could turn out to be a very valuable point in their fight for Premier league survival Colback rescued what could turn out to be a very valuable point in their fight for Premier league survival But Newcastle halved the deficit in the 49th minute as Simon Mignolet could not claim Vurnon Anita's hanging cross, leaving an empty net for Cisse to head into. Cisse then made a mess of a promising opening on the break as Newcastle pushed for a second. Jurgen Klopp was disappointed with his side’s 2-2 draw Jurgen Klopp was disappointed with his side’s 2-2 draw After Firmino saw a goal chalked off for offside at the other end, the visitors equalised in the 66th minute when Andros Townsend's cross was nodded down inside the box and Colback's first-time shot deflected past Mignolet. Neither side could grab a winner, with Lallana's low cross going untouched in the six-yard box and Coutinho having a shot blocked inside the box. Matt Le Tissier gives his thoughts on Newcastle's comeback to earn a point against Liverpool Matt Le Tissier gives his thoughts on Newcastle's comeback to earn a point against Liverpool Matt Le Tissier's Soccer Saturday verdict \"It was a brilliant finish by Sturridge to put Liverpool 1-0 up after 68 seconds and Lallana made it two with an equally good goal. At that point, you could not see any other result. \"Wijnaldum came on at half-time, so Newcastle changed it a little bit then. And they got an early second-half goal, which really geed them up a bit, because they were looking a bit down-hearted heading into half-time. \"I'd probably say Mignolet was a little bit at fault for the Cisse goal. I think he must have been bored in that first half because he decided to try and come for the cross and never got near enough. It went over him and Cisse was at the far post. \"Colback then made it 2-2 with a shot that took a little deflection, and Newcastle scrapped and fought from that moment on to the final whistle. They defended really well and ground out a point. As unlikely as it seemed, it might just be a very important one.\" Rafael Benitez was delighted with his team after they came from two goals down Rafael Benitez was delighted with his team after they came from two goals down Player ratings Liverpool: Mignolet (5), Randall (5), Lovren (6), Toure (6), Moreno (7), Stewart (6), Allen (7), Milner (6), Firmino (6), Lallana (7), Sturridge (7).

Andy Carroll celebrates with Dimitri Payet after opening the scoring at Upton Park Watford were handed a lifeline when Sebastian Prodl slammed in a half-volley after 64 minutes, but substitute Troy Deeney saw his late penalty saved by Adrian before Nordin Amrabat was sent off for his second yellow card in the dying seconds. Manchester United's 2-0 win over Crystal Palace means West Ham remain sixth, three points off fifth and a further point behind fourth-placed Arsenal, who face West Brom live on Sky Sports on Thursday. Watford, with an FA Cup semi-final on Sunday, made seven changes but it was Carroll, one of three West Ham alterations from their 2-2 draw at Leicester, who opened the scoring. Carroll volleys past Heurelho Gomes to open the scoring at Upton Park The Hammers striker guided home Dimitri Payet's cross for his sixth goal in as many games. Falling behind brought Watford to life, but with Odion Ighalo left out of the squad and Deeney on the bench, they lacked a focal point, and West Ham made them pay just before half-time. Holebas was the villain for the visitors, climbing over the back of Kouyate, and referee Mike Dean had no hesitation in pointing to the spot. Noble still had plenty to do against Heurelho Gomes, who saved two Saido Berahino penalties on Saturday, but the midfielder sent the goalkeeper the wrong way. It could have been even better for the home side in first-half stoppage time, but Manuel Lanzini miscued wide when it looked easier to score. Manuel Lanzini is closed down by Valon Behrami on Wednesday evening Abdi spared his blushes shortly after the restart, turning Jose Manuel Jurado's cross over the bar and leaving manager Flores with his head in his hands on the sideline. The Hornets midfielder capped a nightmare few minutes when he then conceded the second penalty of the evening for a pull on Antonio, duly dispatched by a grateful Noble. West Ham manager Slaven Bilic hailed his side's performance after they beat Watford 3-1 at home West Ham manager Slaven Bilic hailed his side's performance after they beat Watford 3-1 at home But 11 minutes later Watford threatened to make a game of it as Prodl expertly fired home Steven Berghuis' free-kick. The goal prompted Flores to introduce Ikechi Anya and Deeney, and the pair made a difference as Anya twice stretched the West Ham defence. Watford manager Quique Sánchez Flores was pleased with his side's display despite suffering a 3-1 defeat away at West Ham Watford manager Quique Sánchez Flores was pleased with his side's display despite suffering a 3-1 defeat away at West Ham The hosts had chances to wrap up the points too, as Victor Moses and Lanzini both squandered clear-cut opportunities, but an Angelo Ogbonna shirt-pull on Prodl gave Deeney the perfect chance from the spot to set up a frantic finish. The Hornets striker could not take it, though, as his poorly-struck spot-kick was kept out by Adrian. Things got worse for the visitors in the closing stages when Amrabat, booked for a late challenge on Kouyate midway through the second half, saw red for a similarly mistimed lunge on Winston Reid deep into stoppage time.

Divock Origi's opening goal ​Jurgen Klopp delivered in his first Merseyside derby as Liverpool tore apart 10-man Everton to win 4-0 at Anfield. Goals from Divock Origi (43) and Mamadou Sakho (45) were an accurate reflection of the Reds' dominance even before Ramiro Funes Mori was shown a straight red card (50) for a challenge on Origi. The tackle ended the Belgian's evening, a sole reason for regret as Daniel Sturridge (61) and Philippe Coutinho (76) made it 12 goals in three home games on an evening which offered further thrilling evidence of Klopp's growing influence. So impressive were Liverpool in recording a fourth straight win on Klopp's derby debut, it was easy to forget the drab display at Goodison Park in October that provided an unremarkable footnote to the Brendan Rodgers era. Origi outjumps John Stones to head his side in front The Reds racked up 41 attempts to their rivals' three, and while Roberto Martinez is unlikely to suffer the same fate as Rodgers in the coming days, defeat in Saturday's FA Cup semi-final would provide real ammunition for the vocal section of Everton supporters continuing to call for a change of manager. Former Everton manager David Moyes said his old side were 'terrible' in their 4-0 defeat to Liverpool Former Everton manager David Moyes said his old side were 'terrible' in their 4-0 defeat to Liverpool Even an admirable record on the road - \"Champions League away form\", according to Martinez this week - looks an ever-more threadbare safety net given the Toffees have collected just two points from their last four games away from Goodison. And aside from the odd ineffective counter-attack early in the game there was little encouragement to be scraped together from a dismal derby performance by a side featuring all Everton's big names. Man of the match James Milner was delighted to see Liverpool maintain their recent momentum Man of the match James Milner was delighted to see Liverpool maintain their recent momentum Joel Robles kept them in it early on, winning one-on-ones with Adam Lallana and Roberto Firmino, but the goalkeeper was beaten twice in as many minutes just as it looked as though Everton's seat-of-the-pants defending would see them to half-time. Robles was caught in two minds as James Milner swung in a cross, Origi outjumping John Stones to head a simple first, and Milner played a one-two with Lallana to lay on the second for an unmarked Sakho. Origi is stretchered off as Daniel Sturridge shows his concern Gareth Barry - on his record-equalling 571st Premier League start - was taken off at the break, but his midfield replacement Muhamed Besic soon found himself playing as a makeshift centre-half after Funes Mori's ugly lunge at Origi brought the fixture's 21st red card of the Premier League era. Ross Barkley was sacrificed in a reshuffle that had no discernible effect as Sturridge, on for Origi, slotted his 50th Liverpool goal after Lucas had intercepted Stones' casual ball out from the back. Sub Sturridge slots his 50th goal for Liverpool That proved Stones' last contribution as he was replaced - suffering stomach cramps - and Liverpool threatened to heap real humiliation on a back line now featuring Besic and James McCarthy. Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp said the injury to Divock Origi dampened the enjoyment of his Merseyside derby win Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp said the injury to Divock Origi dampened the enjoyment of his Merseyside derby win As it was they had to settle for just one more, Coutinho's trademark curler taking the slightest nick off Sturridge, who claimed the goal at the time and again immediately after the final whistle. The England striker rained shots down on Robles towards the end, while full-backs Alberto Moreno and Nathaniel Clyne also came close and even Lucas chanced his arm from distance.

in the race for the top four with a 2-0 victory over Crystal Palace on Wednesday. An early Damien Delaney own goal and a cracking effort from Matteo Darmian means United close the gap on Arsenal in fourth to just one point, although the Gunners have a game in hand. Louis van Gaal's men were rarely troubled by a lacklustre Palace side, who looked to have one eye on Sunday's FA Cup semi-final against Watford and didn't register a single shot on target. Attention now turns to The Emirates on Thursday evening where Arsenal take on West Bromwich Albion, live on Sky Sports 1. Morgan Schneiderlin, Wayne Rooney and Anthony Martial celebrate after Damien Delaney's own goal Julian Speroni was making his first start of the season for Palace as Alan Pardew made seven changes. The goalkeeper's first task of the night was to pick the ball out of his net. Darmian latched onto a nice flick from Marcus Rashford down the left and fizzed a cross into the middle. It was a hopeful cross, but Delaney turned it into a good one as he clumsily turned the ball into his own net with his right foot. From that moment Palace were never in the game as United controlled proceedings through Wayne Rooney, who excelled in a deeper role. He was feeding the front three of Rashford, Anthony Martial and Jesse Lingard fruitful service and all that was lacking was a killer instinct in front of goal, otherwise the scoreline could have become very one-sided. Martial was denied on 23 minutes by a save from Speroni and the Palace stopper had to be even more alert seven minutes later to brilliantly tip away a fearsome shot from the right edge of the box by the lively French attacker. Louis van Gaal believes Manchester United's latest win over Crystal Palace keeps them in with a chance of clinching a top four spot Louis van Gaal believes Manchester United's latest win over Crystal Palace keeps them in with a chance of clinching a top four spot Delaney nearly doubled his tally of own goals for the night on 32 minutes as he accidentally turned a Martial cross towards his own net but his blushes were spared as the ball drifted the wrong side of the post. United had won their previous three Premier League home games by a 1-0 scoreline but always looked capable of finding further breakthroughs and it came on 56 minutes. A corner could only be cleared out to Darmian and under little pressure from the Palace defence, he controlled the ball and rocketed a thunderous half-volley into the net via the far post, scoring his first United goal in spectacular fashion. Alan Pardew admits his side may have had one eye on their FA Cup semi-final clash with Watford after losing 2-0 to Manchester United Alan Pardew admits his side may have had one eye on their FA Cup semi-final clash with Watford after losing 2-0 to Manchester United Rooney was searching for his 100th Premier League goal at Old Trafford for Manchester United and the closest he came to getting it was on the hour mark but his side-footed effort from 20 yards was blocked away by Pape Souare two yards from his goal-line. Speroni saved a Rashford effort just before the striker was substituted to a standing ovation on 63 minutes as United saw the game out very comfortably.

From an offside position, Sergio Aguero scored his 100th Premier League goal as Manuel Pellegrini's men took a 14th-minute lead at St James' Park but Vurnon Anita levelled the contest on 31 minutes with a well-taken goal. Newcastle, buoyed by Saturday's victory over Swansea, pushed for a winner but they couldn't convert their positive performance into goals as City, boosted by the returning Vincent Kompany, stood firm on Tyneside. Given Newcastle's recent plight, the point will be welcomed by Rafa Benitez's side, who were fortunate Chancel Mbemba's challenge on Sergio Aguero in the area went unpunished in the second half. Niall Quinn and Thierry Henry look at the two big talking points surrounding Sergio Aguero - his offside goal and his penalty appeal Niall Quinn and Thierry Henry look at the two big talking points surrounding Sergio Aguero - his offside goal and his penalty appeal For Newcastle, the draw sees them miss the chance to move out of the relegation zone for the first time under Rafa Benitez, they remain 19th, two points from safety. City, meanwhile, remain in third position, five points clear of fifth-placed Manchester United, who have played a game less. Sergio Aguero celebrates after opening the scoring Newcastle almost made the perfect start but Papiss Cisse's fourth-minute header from Andros Townsend's cross nestled on the roof of the City net. The early optimism created by the hosts' promising start soon evaporated in controversial circumstances as Aguero, from a clear offside position, headed Aleksandar Kolarov's free-kick beyond Karl Darlow on 14 minutes. Paul Dummett can't stop the ball as Jesus Navas runs forward The goal sealed a century of top-flight goals in England for the Argentine, who achieved the feat in 147 appearances, second only to Alan Shearer on 124 games. City could have made it two on 23 minutes, but Kevin De Bruyne failed to punish Jamaal Lascelles' error and lashed a wild effort wide. Anita equalises for Newcastle Many sides in Newcastle position would have crumbled at that point, but the hosts rallied and should have been level just before the half hour. Moussa Sissoko intercepted Kolarov's mis-placed pass before running the length of the field to the City area, but he couldn't find the finish as Joe Hart was forced into a routine save. Newcastle boss Rafael Benitez was pleased with how his side came from a goal behind Newcastle boss Rafael Benitez was pleased with how his side came from a goal behind But Newcastle got their reward shortly after as Anita gathered the ball on the right, cut inside Kolarov and crashed a low, left-footed effort off the post and beyond Hart. City started the second half strongly and were denied a penalty five minutes after the interval when Mbemba's clumsy challenge on Aguero was ignored by referee Kevin Friend. Vincent Kompany said he is getting back to full fitness after completing 90 minutes Vincent Kompany said he is getting back to full fitness after completing 90 minutes Jesus Navas and Aguero were both denied by Darlow in the space of 15 minutes as both teams struggled to create clear chances. Newcastle boss Rafael Benitez was pleased with how his side came from a goal behind Newcastle boss Rafael Benitez was pleased with how his side came from a goal behind Georginio Wijnaldum was brought on as Newcastle pushed for a late winner, and the Dutchman came so close to producing just that as Hart expertly kept his effort out two minutes from time as both teams settled for a point.

Kane gave Spurs the perfect start in the ninth minute, linking up with Mousa Dembele before finding the bottom corner. Tottenham's Dele Alli celebrates after scoring against Stoke The visitors had to wait until the 67th minute to double their advantage as Alli chipped home, but Kane quickly added a third as Tottenham turned on the style. And Alli put the icing on the cake with a measured volley eight minutes from time to put the pressure back on Leicester after they dropped points against West Ham on Super Sunday.

Mauricio Pochettino says his Tottenham side are still fighting for and dreaming of winning the Premier League Mauricio Pochettino says his Tottenham side are still fighting for and dreaming of winning the Premier League Kane had already squandered an easier chance when he curled home to put Spurs in front, playing a give-and-go with Dembele before finishing from just inside the box. Two minutes before, the England forward's first touch had let him down in the penalty area, allowing Given to save his shovelled shot after Erik Lamela's through ball. But Kane's 23rd league goal of the season was reward for Tottenham's strong start, and they largely controlled the first half.

Lamela broke behind a tired Stoke defence and squared for the striker to add his 24th league goal of the season, putting him two clear of Jamie Vardy in the race for the Golden Boot. Dele Alli chipped home to score Tottenham's second The hosts found it difficult to live with Tottenham's pace in attack, and despite the introduction of Joselu for an injured Xherdan Shaqiri at half-time, they tested Lloris just once more in the second half. And Alli added his second, and Tottenham's fourth, with a fine volley from Eriksen's cross to add an exclamation point to already impressive performance. Kane leads the Premier League Golden Boot race by two goals Leicester will have the opportunity to restore their eight-point lead when they face Swansea next Sunday, before Spurs are in action again on Monday Night Football at home to West Brom.

​Roberto Firmino and Daniel Sturridge struck as Liverpool beat Bournemouth 2-1 on Sunday. Firmino gave Liverpool the lead in the 41st minute at the Vitality Stadium, and Sturridge doubled their advantage a few minutes later. Josh King then pulled one back in second-half stoppage time for the Cherries, but it was too little too late for Eddie Howe's men. Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp did not respond well when one of the first questions in the Bournemouth press conference was about Daniel Sturridge Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp did not respond well when one of the first questions in the Bournemouth press conference was about Daniel Sturridge Until that point it was a comfortable afternoon's work for Liverpool, who moved level on points with Southampton in the Premier League table. Jurgen Klopp made 10 changes from the side that beat Borussia Dortmund on Thursday night, but his side still dominated most of the first half, albeit creating very few chances. Roberto Firmino bagged Liverpool's first goal Eventually, though, they opened the scoring as Firmino, the only man to keep his place in the side, was on hand to poke the ball into an empty net after Bournemouth goalkeeper Artur Boruc had palmed Sturridge's superbly improvised backheel into the Brazilian's path. Then, on the stroke of half-time, Sturridge doubled their lead, and it was about as easy as it could get for the away side. Jordon Ibe floated a free-kick into the Bournemouth area in the second minute of stoppage time and Sturridge rose highest to head it into the bottom corner. Sturridge celebrates with his team-mates For all captain Tommy Elphick's talk of winning as many games as possible between now and the end of the season, Bournemouth looked for the most part like a side that had reached the 40-point milestone and were already planning their summer holidays. Howe had made just one change from his side that beat Aston Villa last week to reach 41 points, but there was very little to speak of in an attacking sense from the home side in the first half. Eddie Howe says his Bournemouth side did too little too late in their defeat to Liverpool Eddie Howe says his Bournemouth side did too little too late in their defeat to Liverpool In an attempt to get his side going the Bournemouth boss threw on striker Lewis Grabban for Junior Stanislas at the break, but it made little difference as Liverpool continued to dominate the early stages of the second half. Boruc wasn't having his best afternoon in goal for the Cherries, and gave Firmino a great opportunity to make it 3-0 within two minutes of the restart, first spilling the ball out for a corner, before spilling the actual corner into the path of the Brazilian, who crashed the ball wide when he should have hit the target. Sheyi Ojo and Simon Francis tangle And after 53 minutes Sturridge had a glorious chance to add his second, but could only clip the outside of the post with a dink over Boruc after being played in by Joe Allen. One of Klopp's changes was to hand a debut to goalkeeper Danny Ward in place of Simon Mignolet, and the Welshman was called into action on several occasions in the second half, denying King twice before making a great late save from Grabban's close-range header. Firmino scored the opening goal of the game Sturridge had two great chances to add his second in the final few minutes, first hitting the woodwork then curling an effort just over the bar, before Ward was finally beaten in the 93rd minute as King took a touch just inside the area from Andrew Surman's ball before firing home. Bournemouth then could have nicked a point at the death as Steve Cook headed just over, but Liverpool held on for the three points.

"Leonardo Ulloa of Leicester City celebrates after his late equaliser Leonardo Ulloa scored from the penalty spot in the fifth minute of injury-time to earn 10-man Leicester a dramatic 2-2 draw with West Ham. The Foxes' title hopes looked to be derailed by two West Ham goals in the last 10 minutes as Andy Carroll's penalty (84) and Aaron Cresswell's screamer (86) turned Sunday's Premier League clash on its head. Watch the moment Leicester were awarded an injury-time penalty which was to earn them a crucial 2-2 draw against West Ham Watch the moment Leicester were awarded an injury-time penalty which was to earn them a crucial 2-2 draw against West Ham Jamie Vardy's first-half strike had given Leicester the lead but he was sent off for a second yellow card on 56 minutes after being penalised for diving. But the title favourites showed character to claw themselves back into the game, with Ulloa snatching a point at the death from the penalty spot, after Carroll was adjudged to have fouled Jeff Schlupp. Watch Aaron Cresswell's strike which gave West Ham a 2-1 lead at Leicester Watch Aaron Cresswell's strike which gave West Ham a 2-1 lead at Leicester Claudio Ranieri's men remain top of the league and eight points points clear of second-placed Tottenham, who have the chance to close the gap to five points with victory at Stoke on Monday Night Football. Unsurprisingly, Ranieri named the same side for the sixth consecutive game, keeping faith with the players that comfortably dispatched Sunderland 2-0 a week ago. However, West Ham boss Slaven Bilic made five changes to the side the slipped to a 2-1 FA Cup defeat to Manchester United in midweek with Carroll surprisingly named among the substitutes after scoring a hat-trick against Arsenal last weekend. The visitors started quicker and were unfortunate not to score inside the opening two minutes when Cheikhou Kouyate met Dimitri Payet's free kick with a powerful header, only for Kasper Schmeichel to parry it onto the post before it trickled across the line and hit the other upright before ending up in the goalkeeper's arms. Leicester manager Claudio Ranieri praised his side's ability to earn a late draw against West Ham Leicester manager Claudio Ranieri praised his side's ability to earn a late draw against West Ham Leicester broke the deadlock in the 18th minute with a swift counter-attack. Schmeichel was the protagonist as he set the Foxes free from inside his own box, enabling the marauding N'Golo Kante to slide Vardy through to slam home his 22nd goal of the season in emphatic fashion. The frantic start dissipated after the goal as tensions soon began to flare, with firstly Vardy then Winston Reid going into the referee's notebook following two forceful challenges inside 30 minutes. Andy Carroll scores West Ham's equaliser from the penalty spot against Leicester Bilic introduced Carroll at the break and the 27-year-old striker almost hauled the visitors level four minutes after, but he couldn't steer his header on target after he met Payet's low corner. Leicester nearly doubled their lead when Shinji Okazaki found space in behind the Hammers defence, but Vardy couldn't make contact after the Japan international had sent an inviting ball across the face of goal on 55 minutes. Leicester's Kasper Schmeichel makes a save from West Ham's Cheikhou Kouyate And City's task was made all the more difficult when they were reduced to 10 men for only the second time this season when Vardy received a second bookable offence for simulation. The England striker appeared to have been upended in the box by Angelo Ogbonna, but after a theatrical fall referee Jon Moss brandished another yellow to the bewilderment of Ranieri in the technical area and the vociferous home support. West Ham striker Andy Carroll disputed the last-minute Leicester penalty West Ham striker Andy Carroll disputed the last-minute Leicester penalty West Ham, buoyed by the extra man, forced an equaliser six minutes from the end when Wes Morgan was penalised for tugging Reid inside the area at a corner. Carroll converted the resulting penalty, sending Schmeichel the wrong way. The drama wasn't to end there, though, as Cresswell looked to have snatched all three points for Bilic's men with a stunning strike from the edge of the box just two minutes later. Leicester Jamie Vardy (right) reacts after referee Jonathan Moss awarded him a second yellow card for simulation The home fans roared for a penalty of their own in the 90th minute when Robert Huth went down under the challenge of Ogbonna, but referee Moss refused to point to the spot. However, there was late drama when Moss did award a penalty in the dying seconds of the match when Carroll stepped across Schlupp and he went down under minimal contact on the edge of the box. Jamie Vardy of Leicester City scores the opening goal Ulloa kept his nerve with almost the last kick of the match to send the King Power Stadium wild as Leicester need just eight points from their final four matches to claim their maiden top-flight title.

Alexis Sanchez put the hosts ahead at the Emirates on the stroke of half-time with his third goal in as many games, and the hosts squandered several opportunities before Yannick Bolasie secured a point.

The goal earned Crystal Palace a 1-1 draw at The Emirates Should Arsenal goalkeeper Petr Cech have kept out Yannick Bolasie's long-range shot? The goal earned Crystal Palace a 1-1 draw at The Emirates The Palace winger cut inside on 81 minutes and caught Petr Cech by surprise with a low drive from the edge of the box that found the corner. The visitors could have won the game when substitute Wilfried Zaha capitalised on an error from Laurent Koscielny, but a last-ditch tackle from Gabriel bailed out his team-mate. Bolasie scored his fifth league goal of the season at the Emirates The result leaves Arsenal looking over their shoulder in the race for a top-four spot, with Manchester United just four points behind them in fifth place. Meanwhile, Crystal Palace remain 16th and extend their unbeaten run to four Premier League matches. Arsene Wenger brought Cech back into the side after Arsenal's 3-3 draw at West Ham, and the Gunners goalkeeper was the first to be tested. Even then, the first shot on target didn't come until the 28th minute in a low-key start, but Cech comfortably gathered Bolasie's hopeful strike. Alexis Sanchez had given Arsenal the lead with a header in first-half stoppage time It opened up as half-time approached, and both sides had opportunities before Sanchez opened the scoring. Connor Wickham headed Yohan Cabaye's free-kick over the bar for Palace, while Wayne Hennessey smartly denied Mesut Ozil after a neat one-two with Sanchez. The Chilean broke the deadlock in first-half stoppage time, holding off the challenge of Pape Souare and heading over the Palace 'keeper after a measured chip from Danny Welbeck. Sanchez celebrates after heading past Wayne Hennessey It was only Arsenal's second attempt on target in a lethargic opening half as they controlled more than 75 per cent possession but laboured in the north London sun. And they missed several chances after the break to extend their lead, with Alex Iwobi and Welbeck both guilty. The former fluffed a header after a fine cross from Francis Coquelin, before Welbeck struck straight at Hennessey with Ozil and Sanchez waiting for the cross. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger was left disappointed with his team's performance Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger was left disappointed with his team's performance Ozil then sent a free-kick narrowly wide as the Gunners pushed for a second, and Hennessey saved bravely from Welbeck after a poor clearance from substitute Emmanuel Adebayor. Palace served warning of their threat when Bakary Sako's header forced a fine stop from Cech, but the Arsenal 'keeper will not look back fondly on the visitors' winner. With nine minutes to play, Bolasie was shown onto his right-foot and his firm strike squirmed past Cech to level. Crystal Palace boss Alan Pardew praised the performance of Bolasie Crystal Palace boss Alan Pardew praised the performance of Bolasie Arsenal piled forward in search of the winner, but Palace had the best opportunity to steal the victory in stoppage time. A mistake from Koscielny allowed Zaha into the penalty area, and only Gabriel's covering tackle denied Adebayor a tap-in. Boos for the home side were audible at the final whistle following Arsenal's second straight draw, and the dropped points mean they face a battle to hold onto a top-four spot with five games remaining.

"Jermain Defoe, left, celebrates scoring his team's second goal with Fabio Borini Sunderland boosted their Premier League survival hopes with a crucial 3-0 victory over relegation rivals Norwich at Carrow Road. Trailing the hosts by four points at the start of the day, Sunderland took the lead in the 41st minute when Fabio Borini converted from the spot after being brought down in the penalty area by Andre Wisdom. Jermain Defoe doubled his side's advantage in the 53rd minute, converting Borini's cross after an error from Sebastien Bassong before Duncan Watmore rounded off the scoring in injury time. Victory sees 18th-placed Sunderland move to within a point of Norwich in 17th with a game in hand, while the result also sees Aston Villa, who take on Manchester United on Saturday afternoon, avoid relegation for a few hours at least. With so much at stake at Carrow Road tensions were running high and in just the third minute both benches needed to be separated after DeAndre Yedlin took a nasty-looking tumble into the advertisement boards in front of the away dugout following a push from Robbie Brady. Players confront each other, with Sunderland manager Sam Allardyce in the thick of it, after a tackle from Norwich City's Robbie Brady The incident incensed Sunderland boss Sam Allardyce, who was involved in a shoving match with a few of the Norwich substitutes as both benches needed to be pulled apart. There was a frantic pace to the game with Norwich, who brought in Sebastien Bassong for the injured Timm Klose, going close through Jonny Howson and Dieumerci Mbokani, but it was Sunderland who created the clearest opening of the first 20 minutes. Jan Kirchhoff flicked on a deep free-kick into the Norwich box for Borini to run on to, but the striker shot across goal and the ball flashed just past John Ruddy's far post, with Defoe also trying to get a touch. In an open game, Norwich threatened in the 26th minute as Brady's cross was turned goalwards by Younes Kaboul, but Vito Mannone produced a brilliant reflex stop to keep the scores level. The former Arsenal stopper was called into action again just a minute later, tipping over a powerful 30-yard drive from Martin Olsson. However, it was the visitors who took the lead in the 41st minute after Wisdom brought down Borini in the box and Andre Marriner had no hesitation in pointing to the spot. Norwich City's Andre Wisdom (right) fouls Sunderland's Fabio Borini in the box and concedes a penalty The Italian dusted himself down to fire the ball past the dive of Ruddy and into the bottom corner to send Allardyce's men into the break in the lead. Alex Neil introduced Nathan Redmond for the second-half in place of Brady and the winger nearly made an instant impact, hitting the foot of the post with a well-struck drive from 25 yards. Minutes later, Sunderland extended their lead after Sebastien Bassong was caught napping on the ball by Kirchhoff, who then released Borini down the right and the Italian's inch-perfect ball across the six-yard box was toe-poked home by Defoe at the far post for his 16th goal of the season. Robbie Brady (left) is challenged by Sunderland's DeAndre Yedlin Norwich threw on Wes Hoolahan in place of Matt Jarvis on the hour-mark as they looked to get back into the game and they should have had a penalty when Kaboul leaned on Mbokani in the box, but the referee waved play on. The hosts were piling on the pressure and Sunderland needed a last-ditch tackle from Lamine Kone to prevent Mbokani getting a clear shot on goal, before there were more Norwich penalty appeals after another coming together between Kaboul and the Congo striker. Norwich were throwing everything at the visitors as Mbokani's header came back off the line before Hoolahan's shot was cleared away to safety by Lee Cattermole. Sunderland celebrate Fabio Borini's opener Redmond again tried his luck from distance in the 82nd minute, forcing Mannone into another good save to deny the hosts. Allardyce threw on John O'Shea for the impressive Kirschoff as Sunderland looked to see out the final few minutes and it was the visitors who extended their lead in stoppage time as Sebastian Larsson picked out fellow substitute Duncan Watmore and the 22-year-old kept his cool to finish calmly past Ruddy at the near post to put the seal on a crucial three points.

Ramiro Funes Mori had given the home side the lead midway through the second half, but Mane struck back soon afterwards for the Saints. The result leaves Roberto Martinez's side in the bottom half without a win in six games in the Premier League, while Southampton stay seventh. Roberto Martinez says he's pleased with the manner in which Everton went about earning a draw Roberto Martinez says he's pleased with the manner in which Everton went about earning a draw Martinez made six changes from the side that drew 0-0 at Crystal Palace on Wednesday night, with Romelu Lukaku among those dropped to the bench, and Everton certainly started the better, creating the first real chance of the game after 18 minutes. Gerard Deulofeu did well down the right before crossing into the path of Kevin Mirallas, who should have done a lot better than slam his effort from 12 yards straight into Jose Fonte. Everton players celebrate the goal scored by Ramiro Funes Mori The opening appeared to wake Ronald Koeman's side up, and the away side had two opportunities themselves soon afterwards, with both Dusan Tadic and Shane Long flashing efforts over the bar when they should have at least tested the Joel Robles. Southampton then suffered a blow as Fonte was forced off after 37 minutes with what appeared to be concussion but, despite losing their captain, the away side still ended the half stronger and could have taken the lead twice in first-half stoppage time. Bryan Oviedo skips past Dusan Tadic First, Long rose to meet Ryan Bertrand's corner at the near post, but could only strike the back stick, before Virgil van Dijk flashed an effort over after another corner had found him in the area. Southampton began the second half as they ended the first, and six minutes after the break they rattled the woodwork again as Tadic skipped inside before seeing his effort from the edge of the area deflected onto the bar. Ronald Koeman says he's disappointed Southampton only came away from Goodison Park with a point Ronald Koeman says he's disappointed Southampton only came away from Goodison Park with a point Against the run of play, though, it was Everton who took the lead after 68 minutes as Funes Mori's shot was deflected past the helpless Fraser Forster after his initial header from Mirallas' corner had rebounded back to him in the box. Everton's lead, however, lasted just eight minutes as they showed off their soft centre once again. Tadic charged into the box from the right for Southampton before the balled ricocheted in the path of Mane, who swooped in to slot home from inside the six-yard box. Everton's Arouna Kone battles in the air with Southampton's Jose Fonte There looked like there would only be one winner in the final stages as substitute Jay Rodriguez was denied a near-certain goal by Funes Mori's late challenge, and Robles was forced into a stop at his near post after Mane had cut in from the byline. In the end, though, Everton held out and even had the chance to hand second-half debuts to 17-year-old Tom Davies and 19-year-old Callum Connolly. Roberto Martinez and Ronald Koeman Martinez and Co will now turn their attention to the Merseyside derby at Anfield on Wednesday night, before a trip to Wembley for their FA Cup semi-final with Manchester United three days later. Soccer Saturday verdict - Paul Merson \"I thought Southampton were the better team. They went for it a lot more and they went behind against the run of play. I do feel sorry for Roberto Martinez this week because they have got a massive football match coming up next week and they have had to play at home, where he is getting a bit of stick. You don't want to play your best team and now you have to go to Liverpool on Wednesday night. What do you do? If they play a team as weak as that, they will get ripped apart. Paul Merson believes this week could determine the future of Roberto Martinez as Everton manager. Paul Merson believes this week could determine the future of Roberto Martinez as Everton manager. \"But I don't see how you can play a strong side when you have got an FA Cup semi-final. No good beating Liverpool and then getting beat by Man United. I think the only way he has got a chance of keeping his job is winning the FA Cup. Everton brought Davies on, who is 17, and he did something that made you think 'this kid is going to be good'. In his own box, he threw a little dummy, and then rolled it out wide, and you thought 'hmm, he can play'.\" Player ratings Everton: Robles (6), Coleman (6), Funes Mori (7), Stones (6), Oviedo (6),

relegation to the Championship has been confirmed after a 1-0 defeat to Manchester United at Old Trafford. Marcus Rashford's seventh goal of the season, turning in Antonio Valencia's low cross on 32 minutes, proved the winner in Villa's 24th defeat of the season, which leaves them an insurmountable 15 points short of safety with four games left. The West Midlands club end their 28-year stay in the top-flight with one of the poorest campaigns from any Premier League side - and they went out with a wimper. Substitute Rudy Gestede went closest late on when he hit the post from a corner but United should have scored more, with Memphis Depay hitting the post in stoppage time, as Wayne Rooney made his first start in over two months after injury. Aston Villa caretaker manager Eric Black says it is a difficult day for the club after his side were relegated to the Championship Aston Villa caretaker manager Eric Black says it is a difficult day for the club after his side were relegated to the Championship Villa's fate has appeared a foregone conclusion for some time, with the club sitting bottom of the division since November 2 and winning just three games all season, but that will do little to soften the blow to one of England's biggest clubs. With victory, meanwhile, United move to within a point of the Champions League spots, with fourth-placed rivals Manchester City playing Chelsea on Saturday Night Football on Sky Sports 1HD, and they deserved their win. Marcus Rashford scored his seventh Manchester United goal of the season The hosts were buoyed by the return of Rooney, making his first start since February 13 as one of five changes to the side that won at West Ham in midweek, with boss Louis van Gaal mindful of another game against Crystal Palace on Wednesday and an FA Cup semi-final at Wembley next weekend. Rooney was lively and influential from the start and his side bossed the opening 20 minutes, with Marouane Fellaini and Chris Smalling both heading wide from corners before Juan Mata danced into the area and should have found the target from 12 yards. Juan Mata says he's delighted Wayne Rooney has returned to the Manchester United line-up following their 1-0 win over Aston Villa Juan Mata says he's delighted Wayne Rooney has returned to the Manchester United line-up following their 1-0 win over Aston Villa At the other end, Jordan Ayew and Kieran Richardson smashed speculative efforts over the bar from distance as Villa struggled to cope with United's movement, and Valencia found space on the right to pick out Rashford for a well-taken opener. Villa had a debatable case for a penalty as Ayew was brought down in the box, but got nothing, and the forward continued to be a rare live-wire for the away side, almost finding the net on the stroke of half-time when a close-range shot was blocked by Smalling. Wayne Rooney made his first start in over two months following injury United then had their own shout for a penalty when Rashford was brought down by Alan Hutton, but got nothing either, before the young striker got up and was put through by Mata to flash a shot wide of the near post. Depay and Daley Blind flashed excellent crosses in front of the Villa goal as United hunted for a second, but they were fortunate not to draw the game after Gestede emerged from the bench to cause problems. The goal was gaping as the forward tried to turn home Ayew's cut back, but his shot was blocked, before he volleyed against the upright with six minutes left. But Villa had to win to have any hope of embarking on a great escape and, as they have done for most of the season, they fell short of what is required to win a Premier League football match. Soccer Saturday verdict - Charlie Nicholas Charlie Nicholas says Aston Villa were no threat to Manchester United at Old Trafford, despite only one goal seperating the teams Charlie Nicholas says Aston Villa were no threat to Manchester United at Old Trafford, despite only one goal seperating the teams \"I thought it was a stroll in the park for Manchester United. They didn't pass it quick enough, didn't get the ball into Rashford early enough. Rooney came back and enjoyed pinging the ball about but never really looked a threat in front of goal. For the first 20-25 minutes he did not really link up with Rashford and it was all a bit slow and deliberate. But, once he started spraying the balls around, you could see he was starting to enjoy it. He comfortably felt his way back into the game. The fourth spot is vital for Manchester United and I thought they could have filled their boots today but they just strolled through the game. \"Villa looked like a team who need the season to end now, understandably so. They had a little bit of fight, when Gestede came on. He hit the post and he should have scored just before that. Ayew up front gave United a bit of work. Looking at the group they have that might be saleable, I think Ayew would be an asset, but they have got big decisions to make defensively. They have got a lot to do in a short space of time\" Louis van Gaal wasn't pleased with the tempo of Manchester United's football, despite beating Aston Villa 1-0 Louis van Gaal wasn't pleased with

crucial 3-0 victory over Swansea at St James' Park on Saturday. Having seen Sunderland beat Norwich earlier in the day, Rafa Benitez raised a few eyebrows with a much-changed starting line-up, dropping both Jonjo Shelvey and Aleksandar Mitrovic to the bench. But the decision was justified as the Magpies claimed a vital win that moves them three points behind 17th-placed Norwich, with a game in hand. Jamaal Lascelles scored the opener from a corner in the 40th minute and stand-in captain Moussa Sissoko doubled the advantage in the 82nd minute after a spell of Swansea pressure. Rafa Benitez praises the Newcastle fans for supporting his players after they beat Swansea 3-0 at St James' Park Rafa Benitez praises the Newcastle fans for supporting his players after they beat Swansea 3-0 at St James' Park Andros Townsend put the result beyond doubt shortly afterwards to give Benitez his first win as Newcastle manager on his 56th birthday. While the Magpies' next two fixtures are against Manchester City and Liverpool, victory keeps them in contention with five matches left to play. Having been heavily criticised for the performance at Southampton last weekend, Benitez made five changes to the starting XI, with Shelvey, Mitrovic and Ayoze Perez dropping to the bench. Andros Townsend added the icing on the cake for Rafa Benitez The home side started positively and Lukasz Fabianski tipped away a cross from Vurnon Anita under the bar. The hosts continued to show encouraging signs against a Swansea side who all but secured their Premier League survival with victory over Chelsea in their previous match. The Swans were unable to replicate that performance and Newcastle went close again in the 33rd minute as Papiss Cisse flicked on a long ball for Jack Colback, who shot at Fabianski. Swansea's Ashley Williams (right) and team-mate Andre Ayew embrace The breakthrough arrived in the 40th minute when Lascelles headed home from a corner, with the ball deflecting in off Fabianski. Newcastle threatened after the break as Townsend's free-kick bounced just in front of Lascelles and Colback fired a first-time shot over the bar. But Swansea upped their game on the hour mark and Andre Ayew saw a shot blocked by Chancel Mbemba before Albert Paloschi glanced a header wide. Benitez saw his side win on his 56th birthday The visitors then created three gilt-edged chances as Ashley Williams fired a half volley wide, Jefferson Montero missed the target after being played in by Bafetimbi Gomis and Gomis then shot past the post. Newcastle made the most of the misses and a fortunate break from a corner in the 82nd minute as the ball kindly for Sissoko to finish past Fabianski. Townsend made sure of the points in the final minute of normal time, slipping the ball under the keeper after good work from Mitrovic in the build-up. Soccer Saturday verdict - Phil Thompson Phil Thompson gives his thoughts on Newcastle 3-0 win over Swansea. Phil Thompson gives his thoughts on Newcastle 3-0 win over Swansea. \"Newcastle were absolutely dreadful last week, some of their worst defending. This season has been astonishing, you would not have put 3-0 on this, in all your life. Newcastle played well. They defended very well today and that gave them the rock to build on. Lascelles and Mbemba were absolutely fantastic, Darlow did not have a save to make. The fans did not get on their backs and I think that helped them settle. \"Maybe Swansea looked at that teamsheet and thought 'this is going to be easy today', because they certainly did not turn up for the first half. It was abject from most of the Swansea players. This was a 'had-to-win' game for Newcastle, when you see the games coming up. It is still going to be difficult but they have given themselves a fighting chance.\" Rafa Benitez praises the Newcastle fans for supporting his players after they beat Swansea 3-0 at St James' Park Rafa Benitez praises the Newcastle fans for supporting his players after they beat Swansea 3-0 at St James' Park Player ratings Newcastle: Darlow (6), Anita (7), Mbemba (7), Lascelles (8), Dummett (7), Tiote (6), Colback (6), Townsend (8), Sissoko (7), Wijnaldum (6), Cisse (6).

The Brazilian proved impenetrable as Berahino was thwarted from 12 yards on 68 minutes and again three minutes from time. In a game which lacked chances, Ben Watson produced the only moment of true quality, turning Adlene Guedioura's low corner past Ben Foster via the post on 27 minutes. And despite conceding two penalties, Watford held on for the victory that sees them break through the 40-point mark in the Premier League and leapfrog the Baggies in the process. Watford manager Quique Sanchez Flores was full of praise for goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes as he saved two Saido Berahino penalties Watford manager Quique Sanchez Flores was full of praise for goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes as he saved two Saido Berahino penalties Tony Pulis recalled Claudio Yacob into the West Brom midfield while Quique Sanchez Flores made four changes as he stepped up his preparations for next weekend's FA Cup semi-final with Crystal Palace. Allan Nyom, Sebastian Prodl, Nathan Ake and Guedioura were reinstated into the Hornets starting line-up having sat out last weekend's draw with Everton. Watford's Ben Watson scores the opening goal against West Brom And it was the visitors who made the promising start, with Guedioura drilling a low effort wide on 17 minutes. West Brom took their time to settle into the game and didn't test Gomes in the Watford goal until 24 minutes, when the bright Stephane Sessegnon's near-post free-kick was tipped away by the Brazilian. Jose Jurado then stung Foster's palms with a long-range effort but the former England 'keeper's was breached shortly after. Watford's Ben Watson celebrates scoring the opening goal against West Brom Watson, who enjoyed a brief loan at West Brom in 2010, got away from James McClean to meet Guedioura's corner at the near post, glancing an effort across the goal and into the back of the net off the woodwork. It could have been two on 34 minutes, but Ake's rash effort failed to capitalise on Troy Deeney and Jurado's good build-up. The Baggies then had two chances to level the contest before the interval, but Berahino sliced wide on 40 minutes before Sessegnon's low effort whistled wide a minute later. West Brom's Stephane Sessegnon is closed down by Nathan Ake of Watford Gareth McAuley called Gomes into action seven minutes after the break as West Brom, with Pulis' half-time team-talk no doubt ringing in their ears, tried to find a route back into the game. Watford, however, weathered the storm and could have doubled their lead, only for Forster to produce a fine save to deny Deeney's goal-bound effort on 57 minutes. The hosts struggled to create anything worthwhile from that point on, but they were handed a lifeline when Gomes brought Berahino down with a rash challenge on 67 minutes. Salomon Rondon is tackled by Ben Watson The big Brazilian, however, atoned for his misjudgment, leaping to his right to keep Berahino's poor spot-kick out a minute later. That seemed to spell the end of Albion's hopes as the game petered out. But referee Michael Oliver's decision to penalise Etienne Capoue for a foul on Sessegnon breathed life into their chances. Berahino, looking to atone for his earlier miss, was denied again by Gomes who tipped the striker's effort wide as the Hornets left victorious.

Matt Le Tissier gives his thoughts on West Brom's defeat to Watford, and Saido Berahino's TWO penalty misses. \"I was surprised Saido Berahino stepped up to take the second penalty after missing the first one but fair play to him for showing bravery and the courage to go up. Obviously it was misplaced confidence but you don't want to take too much credit away from Heurelho Gomes. It wasn't like he missed the target with both his penalties, Gomes had to make saves and the second one, especially, was a very good save. Gomes has had a good season and he looked pretty solid today. He did not put a glove wrong. \"Watford were solid and restricted West Brom to very few chances in open play. I just wonder a little bit about Ighalo and what has happened to him. He looked a shadow of the player from the first half of the season. Possibly teams are paying closer attention to him and, when you go a few games without scoring, the confidence levels drop a bit.\" Tony Pulis says he can't believe West Brom lost 1-0 at home to Watford.

The visitors controlled the first half on Saturday evening and went ahead through Aguero on 33 minutes, although the forward's effort was aided by a deflection off Gary Cahill. The Argentina international finished a City counter-attack for his second, and sealed his hat-trick from the penalty spot after Fernandinho was tripped by Thibaut Courtois, with the Chelsea goalkeeper sent off as a result. The victory moves City above Arsenal, who host Crystal Palace on Super Sunday, while Chelsea remain 10th with just one win from their last eight Premier League home games. Both managers made four changes for the match, and in a frantic opening, both had opportunities to break the deadlock. Strong defending from Cahill prevented Aguero from tapping home after just three minutes, before Nicolas Otamendi cleared Pedro's goal-bound shot off the line with Joe Hart beaten. Yaya Toure says the whole Manchester City team performed well at Chelsea and it was probably their best win of the season Yaya Toure says the whole Manchester City team performed well at Chelsea and it was probably their best win of the season Diego Costa had the ball in the net for Chelsea shortly after but was correctly adjudged offside, and after weathering the early pressure, City stamped their authority on the game. Courtois twice denied the visitors one-on-one, as Kevin De Bruyne and Samir Nasri saw efforts saved by the Chelsea goalkeeper. But the hosts did not heed the warnings and fell behind to a rapid City counter. Aguero scored his third from the penalty spot De Bruyne and Aguero broke from a Chelsea corner, and when the Belgian teed up his team-mate, Aguero cut inside and fired home off Cahill from the edge of the box. With Chelsea on the back foot, only a last-ditch tackle from Cahill prevented Aguero from doubling City's lead two minutes before the break. The Blues started the second half brightly as they searched for a route back into the match, but were caught on the break again as City extended their advantage nine minutes after half-time. The impressive De Bruyne, returning to his former club, was involved before Nasri found Aguero, who made no mistake for his 20th league goal of the season. Aguero followed up his penalty miss against PSG with a successful spot-kick against Chelsea He didn't have to wait long for his 21st, as City made the game safe from the spot with 10 minutes to play. Fernandinho broke into the Chelsea area and was upended by Courtois, leaving referee Mike Dean no choice but to issue the red card and award a penalty. Aguero, who missed against Paris Saint-Germain in midweek, sent substitute goalkeeper Asmir Begovic the wrong way to seal his hat-trick. Chelsea had felt hard done by six minutes before City's third, when referee Dean waved away a penalty appeal after Kenedy appeared to be tripped by De Bruyne in the area. Ruben Loftus-Cheek was bright for Chelsea in the early stages Following the defeat to Swansea, Saturday's loss marks the first time Guus Hiddink has lost two league games in a row as a club manager since February 2004, when he was in charge of PSV Eindhoven. Meanwhile, City head to St James' Park to face Newcastle on Tuesday full of confidence after following up their Champions League win with another strong performance, and now sit four points clear of fifth-placed Manchester United in the race for a top-four place.

Seamus Coleman said a point was a good result after Everton played most of the second half with ten men Seamus Coleman said a point was a good result after Everton played most of the second half with ten men Everton started to settle down after that chance and Seamus Coleman forced a smart save from Wayne Hennessey, who got down quickly to turn a close range volley around the post. The Palace 'keeper had to be alert minutes later to block away a Romelu Lukaku effort from close range. Romelu Lukaku and Wilfried Zaha challenge for the ball Gayle went even closer on 35 minutes but his acrobatic effort from 15 yards sailed just wide of the post before Ramiro Funes Mori narrowly escaped scoring an embarrassing own goal from a dangerous Zaha cross. Barkley, who had been wasteful in possession, came to the party on 49 minutes with a cracking effort from 22 yards that rocketed back off the crossbar. Roberto Martinez, manager of Everton Everton were starting to take control of the game until McCarthy saw red on 51 minutes. He had already been booked for a lunge on Yohan Cabaye in the first half when he deliberately stopped a Bolasie run with a crude body check. The Everton man could have few complaints when the second yellow was brandished. Crystal Palace's Jason Puncheon shoots during the Premier League match at Selhurst Park Despite being a man down Everton still posed a threat and John Stones headed a presentable chance straight at Hennessey on 65 minutes. Adebayor entered the fray four minutes later and from that moment Palace looked the more likely to break through. Jason Puncheon mesmerised the Everton defence on 71 minutes with a silky Cruyff turn before firing a shot that had Robles stretching fully out to his left to palm away. Yohan Cabaye of Crystal Palace is challenged by Coleman The Palace midfielder was now having a huge effect on the game and his cross on 74 minutes was headed over the bar from close range from Adebayor. The two combined again in stoppage time but once again the striker couldn't make a match-winning contact as Everton held out to slightly ease the pressure on manager Roberto Martinez.

Jamie Vardy brace moves Foxes to within sight of the title Jamie Vardy of Leicester City celebrates as he scores their first goal against Sunderland Leicester City moved a step closer to winning the Premier League after beating Sunderland 2-0 at the Stadium of Light on Sunday. Jamie Vardy's second-half brace - the striker's first league goals since February 14, seven matches ago - proved to be the difference between the two teams. As a result, Claudio Ranieri's side moved 10 points clear of second-placed Tottenham Hotspur, but the gap was brought back to seven as Spurs beat Manchester United 3-0. Vardy scored the opener with a neat finish past Vito Mannone Sunderland remain deep in trouble in the relegation zone, though, four points from Norwich City and safety, albeit with a match in hand on the Canaries. Both managers opted to go with the same line-ups from last weekend, meaning Sam Allardyce keeping faith with midfielder Lee Cattermole ahead of Jack Rodwell, who was on the bench for Sunderland. N'Golo Kante takes on Jermain Defoe during Sunday's match Leicester captain Wes Morgan, a rock at the back in recent weeks to help his side keep four consecutive Premier League sheets, had the first chance of the contest. However, unlike against Southampton last weekend, the centre-back could not direct his header from Christian Fuchs' early left-wing corner on target. Graeme Souness and Jamie Carragher take a look at why Sunderland are deep in relegation trouble Graeme Souness and Jamie Carragher take a look at why Sunderland are deep in relegation trouble The visitors also thought they should have had a penalty midway through the first half when Sunderland right-back DeAndre Yedlin caught Shinji Okazaki with a high boot in the box, only for referee Anthony Taylor to disagree with the striker's appeal. The Black Cats had their own penalty claims after Robert Huth handled a Patrick van Aanholt pull back as half-time approached, but the man in the middle deemed it accidental. Sunderland boss Sam Allardyce said Vardy was the difference Sunderland boss Sam Allardyce said Vardy was the difference And it was Leicester goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel who was the first to be called into action in injury time at the end of the first period, with the Dane doing well to keep out Fabio Borini's shot from outside the box, especially as it took a wicked deflection en route to goal. The Foxes then soaked up all that their opponents could throw at them after the break, before striking twice through Vardy in the final quarter of the game. Alan Smith joins Patrick Davison to reflect on Leicester's 2-0 victory at Sunderland Alan Smith joins Patrick Davison to reflect on Leicester's 2-0 victory at Sunderland Leicester's opening goal came about from Danny Drinkwater's lovely weighted ball over the top which picked out Vardy's clever run into the channel, with the England international finishing unerringly past Vito Mannone from an acute angle. That crucial strike was Vardy's 20th league goal of the campaign, making him the first Leicester player to reach that total in the top fight since Gary Lineker in 1984/85. Vardy and Drinkwater react after Leicester's vital 2-0 win over Sunderland Vardy and Drinkwater react after Leicester's vital 2-0 win over Sunderland The Black Cats then huffed and puffed in search of an equaliser, with their best chance falling to Rodwell eight minutes from time. However, after van Aanholt's shot from the edge of the area deflected kindly into his path off Jermain Defoe, the midfielder blazed horribly over the bar with just Schmeichel to beat. Jamie Vardy of Leicester City scores their second goal Leicester then sealed their win in second-half injury time after another breakaway goal as substitute Daniel Amartey fed Vardy just inside Sunderland's half and after outpacing van Aanholt, the frontman rounded the advancing Mannone before shooting into an empty net. And Ranieri and Co - who have now recorded five successive top-flight clean sheets - need just three more victories from their remaining five league games to be assured of a first-ever Premier League title. Manchester United's defeat by Tottenham later on Super Sunday secured a top-four finish for Leicester, though Champions League football cannot be guaranteed just yet as the fourth-place Premier League team will drop into the Europa League if Manchester City and Liverpool are victorious in Europe and both finish outside of the top four.

scoring his side's third goal of the game ​Divock Origi came off the bench to score twice as Liverpool thumped Stoke 4-1 in the Premier League at Anfield on Sunday. Alberto Moreno gave Liverpool an early lead, but Bojan Krkic levelled the game for Stoke shortly afterwards. Daniel Sturridge then put Liverpool back in front after 32 minutes, and Origi netted twice more after the break. It was the perfect result for Jurgen Klopp's side, who can now turn their attention to the visit of Borussia Dortmund in the Europa League on Thursday night. Liverpool's Belgian striker Divock Origi (fourth right) celebrates scoring his team's fourth goal Liverpool took the lead after eight minutes thanks to the quick-thinking of James Milner. The home side won a free-kick out wide and, with Stoke trying to organise themselves, he gave it quickly to Moreno, who took a touch before hammering the ball in from 25 yards. The lead lasted just 14 minutes, though, as Liverpool's inability to defend set-pieces came to the fore once again. Xherdan Shaqiri whipped an excellent ball into the penalty area, and Bojan was left with far too much space in the middle to head past Simon Mignolet. Stoke had the ball in the net again five minutes later but Peter Crouch, making a rare start up front for the Potters, was in an offside position as he nodded in Erik Pieters' cross from close range. Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool (second left) scores their second goal with a header past goalkeeper Jakob Haugaard of Stoke Sturridge then put Liverpool back in front just after the half-hour mark, but the goal was all about Sheyi Ojo. The 18-year-old received the ball on the left, beat Shaqiri with a bit of pace and trickery before sending a teasing cross over to Sturridge at the far post, who happily headed in from point-blank range. Stoke pushed again for an equaliser, with Ryan Shawcross heading just wide from Shaqiri's free-kick and Gianelli Imbula stinging the palms of Mignolet with a long-range effort. Klopp made a change at half-time, throwing on Origi for Ojo, and the substitution paid immediate dividends. Alberto Moreno is tackled by Xherdan Shaqiri After 50 minutes Origi, who netted against Dortmund in midweek, was on the scoresheet again heading past Jakob Haugaard from Milner's cross while unmarked in the six-yard box. And his week got even better on 65 minutes as he notched his second of the afternoon, beating Phil Bardsley far too easily on the left before heading inside and fizzing a shot into the bottom corner. The goal effectively killed the game off, and there was very little action at either end for the final 25 minutes as Liverpool cruised towards the three points that lifted them above Stoke into eighth in the table.

After scrambling clear a half-chance in the six-yard box from Harry Kane, the United defence went to sleep and left Lamela free at the back post. Christian Eriksen found him with a perfect cross but the midfielder headed wide from five yards out under no pressure. Mauricio Pochettino roared his approval on the touchline at the increase in tempo. Kyle Walker answered his manager's call by breezing past Marcus Rojo and into the penalty area on 29 minutes but Timothy Fosu-Mensah came across to make a crucial block inside his own six yard box. Tottenham kept up the intensity in the second period with Eriksen and Kane testing David de Gea with 25 yard efforts, both of which were dealt with by the United 'keeper. United players react after Tottenham scored their second goal Jesse Lingard found space inside the Spurs area on 58 minutes but skewed a presentable opportunity wide from 15 yards. An even better chance fell to Anthony Martial three minutes later as he did brilliantly to beat three Tottenham defenders before firing straight at Hugo Lloris from 10 yards out. United were left to rue that miss as Spurs then went goal crazy. Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino hailed a perfect performance by his players Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino hailed a perfect performance by his players With 70 minutes played, Eriksen burst down the left flank and crossed for the unmarked Alli to smash home from close range - his eighth league goal of the season. The goal lifted the roof off White Hart Lane and just as it was returning from space, Spurs made it 2-0. Lamela drifted in a free-kick from the left, and Alderweireld rose superbly on the penalty spot to glance his header into the bottom right corner. Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino hailed a perfect performance by his players Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino hailed a perfect performance by his players The United defence were now crumbling under intense Spurs pressure and Lamela made it three with their next attack. The winger made up for his earlier miss by superbly guiding Danny Rose's low centre into the bottom left corner from 15 yards. It was as easy as one, two, three. Anything Leicester can do, Spurs can do too. It's as we were in the title race. Leicester lead by seven with six games left to play.

"report": "Andy Carroll of West Ham United celebrates after scoring a hat-trick in thrilling draw Andy Carroll's hat-trick dealt a fresh blow to Arsenal's faint title hopes as West Ham held them to a thrilling 3-3 draw on Saturday. The Gunners looked on course to keep in touch with leaders Leicester when Mesut Ozil and Alexis Sanchez struck inside 35 minutes to put the visitors in firm control at Upton Park. Carroll's treble inside 10 minutes either side of the interval turned the game on its head but though the towering forward might have given England boss Roy Hodgson food for thought, the Hammers had to settle for a point as Arsenal captain Laurent Koscielny hit back (70). The result does little for the sides' respective title and top-four aspirations, Arsenal 10 points adrift of leaders Leicester, having played a game more, and West Ham still in sixth, two points off the Champions League places. Slaven Bilic's side almost made the perfect start as Manuel Lanzini headed Aaron Cresswell's scuffed volley wide inside the opening minute, although the effort would have been ruled out for offside. Carroll scores a spectacular second goal The Argentine was the hosts' biggest threat in a cagey opening and he was unfortunate not to have opened the scoring when, having found the back of the net, linesman Darren Cann wrongfully ruled out his header for offside on 13 minutes. Arsenal posed a constant threat and, within five minutes, they took advantage of their reprieve as Alex Iwobi played Ozil through to slot past Adrian. The opener rattled West Ham, who were restricted to a couple of long-range free-kicks from Dimitri Payet, as Iwobi turned provider again, releasing Sanchez who made no mistake in doubling the Gunners lead with a low finish 10 minutes before the break. Having turned Laurent Koscielny on the edge of the area, Carroll looked to halve Arsenal's lead immediately but David Ospina was alert to keep his low out as the Gunners coasted towards the interval. Ozil opened the scoring for Arsenal at West Ham But their lead was eventually snatched in an emphatic 160-second spell from West Ham. First, Carroll outmuscled Nacho Monreal at the far post to head Cresswell's cross beyond the stricken Ospina on 44 minutes, before the turnaround was completed in stoppage-time with a thunderous left-footed volley. The half-time whistle momentarily spared Arsenal from the ensuing West Ham onslaught, but it was back underway in the second half. The hosts saw half-hearted penalty claims ignored by referee Craig Pawson following Hector Bellerin's clumsy challenge on Lanzini, before they were then denied a third goal as Carroll was penalised for a foul on Koscielny in the build-up to Payet capitalising on defensive hesitancy. The Gunners, though, were unable to keep a rampant West Ham side at bay and the pressure finally told as Carroll complete his hat-trick on 52 minutes with another assured header at the far post after Michail Antonio's cross from the byline. Alexis Sanchez controls the ball under pressure from Aaron Cresswell Carroll had the chance to extend his side's lead further, but his failure to convert Payet's cross opened the door for Arsenal to drag themselves off the canvas. Monreal almost put an indifferent defensive display behind him by levelling the tie on 68 minutes, only for Lanzini to clear his effort from the edge of the area off the line. That chance marked a change in the tide at Upton Park as Arsenal, boosted by the addition of substitute Olivier Giroud, applied the pressure and got the breakthrough through Koscielny's smart finish after another assist from Ozil. Laurent Koscielny of Arsenal celebrates With both sides fighting back from losing positions neither risked losing a point in the closing stages as the spoils were unsatisfactorily shared.

Cherries centre-back Steve Cook gave the visitors a deserved lead on the stroke of half-time when his skillful flick beat Brad Guzan at the near post and striker Josh King capitalised on poor defending (74) to fire the visitors 2-0 ahead.

Interim boss Eric Black made four changes to the side thumped 4-0 at the hands of Chelsea last week, with 20-year-old Jordan Lyden coming in at right-back for the suspended Alan Hutton. Lewis Grabban put in an impressive display for Bournemouth at Villa Park But the Australia U20 international had a torrid time of it as Bournemouth controlled the first half and attacked most from the left-hand side, where Charlie Daniels, Max Gradel and the impressive Lewis Grabban looked menacing. Villa - whose relegation could be confirmed on Sunday were Sunderland to shock leaders Leicester - had idle chances, with Ashley Westwood and Kieran Richardson firing shots high over the bar, while Scott Sinclair was disappointing with his crossing from the right-hand side.

Villa were better in the tackle but not with the ball in the second-half and Bournemouth could have had a penalty on 56 minutes when King broke into the box and appeared to be fouled by Joleon Lescott, but nothing was given. Ashley Westwood was part of Aston Villa's 23rd defeat of the season Substitute Rudy Gestede, who replaced youngster Lyden at half-time, then missed a glorious chance to equalise when Ayew's firm cross beat the striker through his legs from three yards out. King did excellently to grab Bournemouth's second when he jumped on a poor touch from Lescott, who had received a heavy pass, and lifted the ball over Guzan. Despite losing to Bournemouth, Eric Black was pleased with his Aston Villa side's attitude Despite losing to Bournemouth, Eric Black was pleased with his Aston Villa side's attitude There was fight left in the hosts, and Idrissa Gana pushed through midfield to find Ayew on 85 minutes, whose agility confused his marker and space opened up to poke home his sixth goal of the campaign.

The Norwich defence did a good job of keeping Dwight Gayle fairly quiet but Klose unfortunately sustained an injury just before the break and had to be replaced by Sebastien Bassong. Jason Puncheon's goal proved enough to earn Crystal Palace a vital 1-0 win over Norwich Jason Puncheon's goal proved enough to earn Crystal Palace a vital 1-0 win over Norwich The game remained very tight after the interval, Naismith and Yannick Bolasie blazing half-chances over the crossbar at either end. But Puncheon then conjured up a bit of 68th-minute magic, receiving a short pass from Joel Ward, taking a touch as he drifted inside, and then hitting a delightful left-footed curler from the edge of the area which nestled in the bottom corner. Alan Pardew and Crystal Palace can savour Premier League victory once again The game really opened up after the goal and chances suddenly came thick and fast, Norwich almost fashioning an immediate equaliser, only for Wayne Hennessey to dive to his right and brilliantly keep out a Ryan Bennett volley. Desperate for the three points, the Palace defence were happy to put their bodies on the line, and Souare produced a stunning block moments later to deny Robbie Brady.

Sub Wilfried Zaha was released by Yohan Cabaye and drew a good save from John Ruddy, before Bolasie and Jedinak somehow failed to poke the ball over the line after a corner prompted a goal-mouth scramble. Puncheon curled a shot into the corner from the edge of the box to win it for Palace Brady then charged towards goal at the other end but the alert Hennessey rushed off his line and did really well to block the shot. Time began to run out for the visitors and Ruddy came forward for a pair of late set-pieces but the Palace defence held firm, with Dann and Delaney excellent in the second half.

The Canaries remain outside the bottom three but ma face a nervous few weeks and now turn their attentions to a massive game against Sunderland at Carrow Road next Saturday.

top goal to win any football match; Puncheon comes in off the right, took it on to his left and he bent it in the far corner. \"It was a good finish but, bar that, nothing in it.\" Player ratings

"Southampton striker Graziano Pelle celebrates after scoring against Newcastle at St Mary's Stadium Newcastle's survival hopes suffered a huge setback as they lost 3-1 to Southampton at St Mary's on Saturday. A fine solo strike from Shane Long put the Saints ahead after four minutes, and they doubled the lead before the break through Graziano Pelle's fourth goal in as many games. Victor Wanyama added a third with a controlled finish 10 minutes after half-time, before Andros Townsend offered the visitors a glimmer of hope with a stunning goal from 25 yards. Victor Wanyama found the net ten minutes after half-time Already short of options in defence, Steven Taylor and Daryl Janmaat limped off for Newcastle, who remain six points from safety after their ninth consecutive Premier League defeat away from home. Long returned to Ronald Koeman's side as one of three changes from their 1-0 loss to Leicester, and the Southampton striker put his side in front early on. Shane Long opened the scoring for Southampton after just four minutes at St Mary's After collecting a give-and-go with Pelle, Long drifted past Taylor and picked out the bottom corner of Karl Darlow's net for his eighth league goal of the season. It was one-way traffic throughout the first half as Newcastle saw their only attempt, after a neat turn by Ayoze Perez, blocked by Jose Fonte. Goal-scorer Victor Wanyama gives his thoughts after Southampton's 3-1 win over Newcastle Goal-scorer Victor Wanyama gives his thoughts after Southampton's 3-1 win over Newcastle It looked only a matter of time before Southampton extended their lead as Jordy Clasie's free-kick almost caught out Darlow while Pelle headed over when well placed six yards out. But the hosts made their pressure count seven minutes before half-time as Pelle swept home Long's poor first touch for his fourth goal in as many games. Newcastle's defence show their frustration after Victor Wanyama adds Southampton's third goal A slip from Janmaat allowed Dusan Tadic to pick out Long, and when his touch came back to Pelle, the striker blasted first-time past Darlow. The home side added their third shortly after the restart as Wanyama fired home after more poor defending. Newcastle switched off from a Saints corner allowing Sadio Mane to find Fonte unmarked, and when his shot was saved, Wanyama followed up. Victor Wanyama celebrates his second-half goal at St Mary's The visitors had improved and threatened to make things interesting when Townsend picked out Fraser Forster's top corner with 25 minutes remaining. Southampton allowed the former Spurs winger to cut onto his left foot, and Townsend's fierce drive left the Saints goalkeeper no chance. But it was Koeman's side who looked more likely to find the net again as Mane went close for the hosts, who saw the game out to move onto 50 points for the season ahead of a trip to Everton next Saturday. Newcastle defender Jamaal Lascelles felt side side were not good enough against Southampton Newcastle defender Jamaal Lascelles felt side side were not good enough against Southampton The biggest cheer of the final stages was reserved for Southampton forward Jay Rodriguez, who replaced Tadic to make his first appearance since October.

Stadium on Saturday. Chelsea came into the game unbeaten in 15 games, but Gylfi Sigurdsson's goal on 25 minutes was enough for the hosts, who have moved onto 40 points in the Premier League. Only Harry Kane (11) and Sergio Aguero (10) have now scored more Premier League goals in 2016 than Sigurdsson (9). The visitors could have no complaints about the result although Pato, who was making his full debut, missed a glorious chance from six yards out in the second period. Chelsea broke the news in the week that Antonio Conte is set to take over as manager in the summer and although he wasn't in attendance in south Wales, he is reportedly keen to give Asmir Begovic a chance to impress. Begovic came in as one of three changes for Chelsea to replace Thibaut Courtois, his first start since November in the Premier League. Guus Hiddink says his side were not sharp enough in the final third and a poor defensive spell cost his side in their 1-0 defeat at Swansea Guus Hiddink says his side were not sharp enough in the final third and a poor defensive spell cost his side in their 1-0 defeat at Swansea Swansea have shot up the league under the watch of their new manager Francesco Guidolin, conceding just two goals in five home games under the Italian, and the hosts started on the front foot. Jefferson Montero, who terrorized Chelsea when these teams met in August, provided a great outlet on the left and it was from his tricky work that Sigurdsson opened the scoring on 25 minutes. Gylfi Sigurdsson celebrates scoring Swansea City's opener against Chelsea Montero jinked his way into the box before lofting in a cross that Matt Miazga could only head straight into the path of Sigurdsson, who hit a first-time effort into the bottom corner. It was his 11th goal of the season. The goal pumped Swansea up to another level as Chelsea struggled to handle their intensity without the ball. Leroy Fer couldn't turn home a decent opportunity at the back post on 35 minutes before a mix-up between Asmir Begovic and Baba Rahman nearly presented a chance to Andre Ayew but he fluffed his lines. Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Federico Fernandez compete for the ball For all their positive play, Swansea nearly went in at the break level as Pato should have done better from 10 yards after Oscar's shot was blocked. Chelsea's Asmir Begovic says they were not at their best in the first half Chelsea's Asmir Begovic says they were not at their best in the first half The Brazilian could have been forgiven for missing that chance but the one he spurned on 53 minutes was harder to excuse. Pedro did brilliantly down the left and put a cross seemingly on a plate for Pato to finish but his decision to try an audacious flick didn't come off as the ball spun wide of the post. Sigurdsson fires Swansea 1-0 up against Chelsea Jack Cork stung the palms of Begovic three minutes later before Montero somehow headed the ball over the crossbar from six yards after a brilliant dribble and cross down the flank by Sigurdsson. Swansea boss Francesco Guidolin says safety is nearly sealed after beating Chelsea Swansea boss Francesco Guidolin says safety is nearly sealed after beating Chelsea Hiddink tried to freshen things up by bringing on Bertrand Traoré and the retuning Radamel Falcao, but they looked incapable of severely testing the Swansea back four, led impeccably by Ashley Williams, who made two brilliant clearances inside his area in stoppage time.

Both goals came in first-half injury time, with James McCarthy opening the scoring for the visitors after a terrible error from Watford centre-back Miguel Britos. The home side equalised almost immediately through Jose Holebas' header to end a poor recent run of four league defeats in a row as both teams moved to within touching distance of the 40-point mark. Hornets boss Quique Sanchez Flores made five changes from last weekend's 4-0 loss at Arsenal, with experienced Swiss midfielder Valon Behrami returning after a recent illness. Everton, meanwhile, made just the one alteration from Sunday's 1-0 defeat at Manchester United, with influential holding midfielder Gareth Barry back after a two-game ban. Both teams took their time to get into their stride, though, with the first effort on goal coming just past the quarter-hour mark when Jurado's well-struck shot from the edge of the box producing an excellent one-handed save from Everton goalkeeper Joel Robles. The Merseysiders also had their own moments of threat in a quiet first half, with Gerard Deulofeu forcing a good stop from Heurelho Gomes in the Watford goal moments later. Everton boss Roberto Martinez was disappointed not to get all three points at Watford. Everton boss Roberto Martinez was disappointed not to get all three points at Watford. However, the contest really exploded into life in the four minutes of stoppage time added on at the end of the first period. Firstly, Etienne Capoue came within inches of breaking the deadlock with a well-struck effort from the right-hand edge of the box that was deflected inches past Robles' right-hand post. From the resulting corner, though, the Toffees broke up field, but there appeared little danger when Britos won the ball back for Watford, only for the Uruguayan to be robbed by McCarthy on the edge of his own area. The Irishman then raced through on goal, before coolly beating Gomes to seemingly give his side a first-half lead. However, Watford still had time for a late corner - needlessly given away after a poor back pass by John Stones to Robles - from which Holebas rose high at the far post to head home Ben Watson's delivery, albeit with the aid of a deflection off Seamus Coleman. Everton stepped up the pace after the break as they looked to halt a run of three straight league defeats, a sequence that saw their fans hold up banners calling for boss Roberto Martinez to quit, but they were unable to find a way past Gomes. Everton supporters displayed a banner showing their displeasure with boss Roberto Martinez Manager throughout the game at Vicarage Road The veteran Brazilian shot-stopper produced impressive stops to twice keep out Aaron Lennon and then Romelu Lukaku, whose recent mini goal draught continued. With time running out, though, both teams came close to stealing all three points as first Lukaku had a close-range shot deflected on to the bar after Gomes had pushed aside a Kevin Mirallas free-kick. And then in injury time, Watson's deflected drive was acrobatically pushed behind by Robles.

"Samir Nasri scored for City on his return to the starting line-up Samir Nasri scored a second-half winner on his return to the starting line-up as Manchester City beat West Brom 2-1 at the Etihad Stadium on Saturday. West Brom took the lead after Stephane Sessegnon beat Joe Hart at his near post with a superb effort early on, before City equalised through Sergio Aguero's penalty. Nasri, who was making his first Premier League start since September after injury, converted from close range to make it 2-1, and City held on for the three points. Sergio Aguero equalised from the spot for City The result leaves City fourth - four points clear of Manchester United, who play on Sunday - while West Brom are 13th on 40 points. City made five changes from the side that drew 2-2 at PSG in midweek, but they got off to a slow start at the Etihad as West Brom took the lead after six minutes. James McClean's ball from the left found its way to Sessegnon on the right corner of the area, and his fierce half-volley founds its way past Hart at his near post, West Brom's first shot on target in 210 minutes of top flight football. Samir Nasri scored the winner on his return to the starting line up as Manchester City beat West Brom 2-1 Samir Nasri scored the winner on his return to the starting line up as Manchester City beat West Brom 2-1 City were level 13 minutes later as Sessegnon turned from hero to villain, clumsily catching Aleksandar Kolarov from behind just inside the area, allowing Aguero to slot home a superb penalty on his 200th appearance for the club. Eliaquim Mangala went close with a header from a corner soon after, before substitute Craig Gardner, who replaced the injured Salomon Rondon, put a well-worked left-footed effort wide of the post. Stephane Sessegnon opens the scoring for West Brom Aguero forced Ben Foster into a good save from range in the second half, while at the other end West Brom had a strong call for a penalty turned down by referee Mike Jones after Mangala had piled through Sandro in the area. City scored the winner on 66 minutes after Aguero's blocked shot from close range fell to Nasri, who slipped the ball past West Brom defender McAuley on the line. It was an emotional goal for the Frenchman, who was starting his first game since early September after a thigh injury. Manuel Pellegrini was pleased with Manchester City's 2-1 over West Brom at the Etihad Stadium Manuel Pellegrini was pleased with Manchester City's 2-1 over West Brom at the Etihad Stadium Saido Berahino failed to wrap his foot around the ball having been handed a clear chance in the area, before Foster again denied Aguero - who went off with an injury later shrugged off by Manuel Pellegrini - from the right of the area with a fine low save. West Brom came within inches of an equaliser in the fourth minute of stoppage time as Hart's unconvincing punch from a corner fell to McClean, but his volley dropped just wide of the left-hand post as City survived.

team-mates after opening the scoring against Southampton Wes Morgan's first goal of the season earned Leicester City a 1-0 victory over Southampton to move them seven points clear at the top of the Premier League. The Foxes captain rose highest on 38 minutes to head Christian Fuchs' cross home to seal a hard-fought victory which moved them to within four wins of a maiden top-flight crown. Until that point it appeared the nerves may be getting the better of Claudio Ranieri's side as the Saints pushed for the breakthrough, with Sadio Mane controversially denied by Danny Simpson's arm in the first half. But Leicester produced a resolute defensive display and arguably could have enjoyed a more comfortable afternoon had it not been for the heroics of Saints goalkeeper Fraser Forster. Jamie Vardy takes on Victor Wanyama during the game at the King Power Stadium The result sees Leicester move seven clear of second-placed Tottenham and 11 clear of Arsenal, while Southampton remain seventh on 47 points. For the fourth game running Ranieri opted for his tried and tested starting line-up and named an unchanged side while Southampton made four changes, with Cedric Soares, Matt Targett, Victor Wanyama and Mane drafted in to start. And the hosts' continuity saw them make the more positive start, with Riyad Mahrez and Jamie Vardy both supplying driven crosses from either flank which Shinji Okazaki failed to connect with inside 20 minutes. Those two chances in quick succession kicked Southampton into life, as Graziano Pelle headed the visitors' first clear chance onto the roof of the net shortly before the half-hour mark. Morgan gives his thoughts after scoring the only goal of the game against Southampton Morgan gives his thoughts after scoring the only goal of the game against Southampton Mane was then denied the opener three minutes later when, having rounded the on-rushing Kasper Schmeichel, he saw his goal-bound effort strike Simpson, with replays confirming contact with the Leicester full-back's arm. The incident went unpunished but Southampton carried on undeterred as Fonte's long-range strike forced Schmeichel into a fine save, before Jordy Clasie whistled a shot wide. Having survived the Southampton onslaught Leicester hit back to devastating effect, as Fuchs crossed for his defensive partner Morgan to tower over Clasie to head the league leaders in front. Southampton manager Ronald Koeman felt his side should have had two penalties against Leicester Southampton manager Ronald Koeman felt his side should have had two penalties against Leicester It proved to be a lead they would not surrender as Southampton threatened to haul themselves back into the game but always looked susceptible on the counter. Fonte almost doubled Leicester's advantage for them, inadvertently sending Drinkwater's cross looping over Forster, only for the England stopper to claw the ball from under his crossbar with a brilliant save on 61 minutes. Forster was called upon again to thwart Simpson from close range, after great build up play from Vardy and Drinkwater 10 minutes later, although the full-back should have scored. Claudio Ranieri praised his Leicester side's 'fantastic effort' against Southampton Claudio Ranieri praised his Leicester side's 'fantastic effort' against Southampton The Saints were denied a penalty on 73 minutes when substitute Charlie Austin saw his cross strike Robert Huth's arm, but referee Michael Oliver was unmoved. Five minutes from time, Vardy's low shot was kept out by Forster as he completed a hat-trick of exceptional saves. However there was little else Forster could do to take the gloss off an afternoon which saw Leicester's unlikely title bid gather yet more pace thanks to their fifth 1-0 win in six matches. Graeme Souness and Peter Schmeichel analyse Danny Simpson blocking Sadio Mane's goal-bound shot with his arm Graeme Souness and Peter Schmeichel analyse Danny Simpson blocking Sadio Mane's goal-bound shot with his arm Super Sunday verdict - Graeme Souness Leicester were nervy today. They didn't play any football today. They defended like demons - and for as much of the ball as Southampton had, they didn't make the goalkeeper work.

Gerard Deulofeu, starting as one of two changes made by Roberto Martinez, was causing plenty of problems down the right, while United goalkeeper David de Gea had to be alert on 26 minutes to rush out of his area and clear the ball away from Romelu Lukaku - who had got in behind following a slip by Chris Smalling. Deulofeu is blocked by Marcos Rojo of Manchester United Martinez also recalled John Stones to the starting line-up, and after 37 minutes the England defender brilliantly intervened to prevent Martial from having a clear sight of goal, perfectly timing a sliding tackle just inside the area to take the ball away from the United striker. Van Gaal had named an unchanged line-up from the side that won the Manchester derby a fortnight ago, but he was forced into a change at half-time when Marcos Rojo picked up a knock, the Dutch boss putting on Timothy Fosu-Mensah in his place. Anthony Martial netted Manchester United's 1000th home Premier League goal in their 1-0 win over Everton Anthony Martial netted Manchester United's 1000th home Premier League goal in their 1-0 win over Everton And Everton nearly took advantage of United's defensive reshuffle after 49 minutes, but Daley Blind eventually did superbly to get a block on Lukaku's close-range effort and steer it just wide. Fosu-Mensah would, however, make the difference at the other end for United's opener after 54 minutes. On the charge the youngster picked up Marcus Rashford's flicked backheel, got into the box and played the ball across for Martial to finish at the far post. Manchester United fans show their appreciation as Sir Bobby Charlton is honoured at Old Trafford Everton nearly levelled immediately as Phil Jagielka crashed a header from a corner onto the crossbar, before Jesse Lingard went close to doubling United's lead, but couldn't quite get a toe onto Juan Mata's low cross as he slid in. Martinez replaced Deulofeu with Kevin Mirallas with just under half an hour to go, but it took until the 83rd minute for Everton to test De Gea for the first time. Jagielka again was causing problems from a corner as he forced United's goalkeeper into a point-blank save, before the impressive Fosu-Mensah intervened to keep Seamus Coleman's low cross from reaching Mirallas, who would have had a simple tap-in in the six-yard box to steal a point.

"Chelsea midfielder Pedro scored twice against Villa Pedro scored twice as an under-strength Chelsea thrashed Aston Villa 4-0 in caretaker manager Eric Black’s first game in charge at Villa Park. In a game that had the feel of a pre-season affair, Chelsea, who handed Matt Miazga his debut, broke the deadlock in the 26th minute with Ruben Loftus-Cheek firing home Cesar Azpilicueta's cross to score his first Premier League goal. Substitute Alexandre Pato, who came on to replace the injured Loic Remy midway through the first half, marked his own debut in perfect fashion, scoring from the spot right at the end of the half after Aly Cissokho brought him down in the box. Alexandre Pato converted from the penalty spot The visitors grabbed a third immediately after the restart with Pedro finishing off an excellent passing move and the Spaniard added a second in the 59th minute to round off the scoring and inflict a seventh straight Premier League defeat on Villa. Victory moves Chelsea six points behind West Ham in fifth ahead of this afternoon's games, while Villa, who had Alan Hutton sent off in the 85th minute for a second bookable offence, could be relegated as early as next week depending on results. In what was a slow start at Villa Park, Chelsea, who made four changes to the side which fought back to earn a 2-2 draw with West Ham last time out, created the first sight of goal as Pedro sent a well-struck shot onto the roof of the Villa net. Pato made an impact after coming on as a substitute The Spaniard was involved again in the 19th minute and he had the ball in the net, chipping the ball over Brad Guzan after being played in by Cesc Fabregas, but the flag went up for offside against the Spanish winger. Chelsea were forced into an early change due to an injury to Remy and it meant a debut for January signing Pato, 63 days after joining the club. And three minutes later the Blues were ahead after Azpilicueta drilled a low ball into the area which Loftus-Cheek fired past Guzan at his near post, courtesy of a slight defection. Villa almost showed the perfect response as Jordan Ayew broke into the Chelsea area, slipping Carles Gil through on goal. The Spaniard forced Thibaut Courtois into a sharp save low down to his left before Baba Raham smashed a clearance against Ayew, only to see the ball loop back into the arms of the Chelsea goalkeeper. John Obi Mikel in action for Chelsea at Villa Park Chelsea, who were lucky not to have Fabregas sent off for a second bookable offence, countered through Pato, who found Rahman out on the left. The full-back got a decent strike away but Guzan stuck out a strong hand to make the save. Villa threatened an equaliser with Ayew's shot drifting wide of the far post but things got worse for Black's side as Chelsea doubled their advantage through substitute Pato. The Brazilian beat Guzan from the penalty spot after Sissokho hauled him to the ground as he looked to get on the end of Fabregas' cross. Chelsea threw on Oscar for Kenedy at the break and they extended their lead immediately after the restart with the substitute pulling the ball back for Pedro to drill a low shot past Guzan. Ruben Loftus-Cheek is congratulated after scoring for Chelsea Pedro had his second of the game just before the hour mark after Guzan could only parry Pato's shot into the path of the Spaniard, who made no mistake from close range. The boos were ringing round Villa Park with chants of \"you're not fit to wear the shirt\" as Black brought on Jack Grealish for Gil and Leandro Bacuna for Carlos Sanchez, and Grealish thought he should have had a penalty after a coming together in the penalty area with Pedro. However, referee Neil Swarbrick waved away the appeals. As planned, the Villa Park faithful raised placards in the 74th minute against owner Randy Lerner, but on the pitch the home side nearly pulled a goal back as Ayew found Rudy Gestede on the edge of the penalty area, but the striker failed to steer the ball home. Aston Villa supporters staged a protest towards the end of the game The jeers continued to ring around Villa Park as the pitch was littered with the placards from the protest and Villa's plight was worsened when Hutton, who was booked in the 78th minute for a foul on Pato, received his marching orders for forceful challenge on Loftus-Cheek five minutes from time. Villa went close to a consolation goal in the 88th minute when Grealish lashed Ayew's floated cross wide, but there was to be nothing for the home fans to cheer as Villa close in on relegation to the Championship.

Alexis Sanchez put the Gunners ahead after four minutes at the Emirates, before Alex Iwobi's second goal for the club in as many games doubled their lead shortly before half-time. A deflected strike from Hector Bellerin made it three just after the break, and substitute Theo Walcott added a fourth with a close-range finish in stoppage time. Hector Bellerin made it three to Arsenal just after half-time Ikechi Anya squandered Watford's best opportunity late on, while goalkeeper David Ospina was called into action just once to deny Troy Deeney. The win means Arsenal sit four points off Tottenham after their Saturday Night Football draw against Liverpool, and eight points behind league leaders Leicester, who take on Southampton on Super Sunday. Having lost to Watford in their FA Cup quarter-final last month, Arsene Wenger picked the same team that beat Everton a fortnight ago and the hosts eased any nerves of a repeat with the opening goal inside four minutes. Alexis Sanchez opened the scoring after just four minutes at the Emirates Iwobi crossed for Sanchez and when the Chilean's initial effort was saved by Heurelho Gomes, he reacted quickest to turn home his first league goal at the Emirates since October. The Gunners controlled the first-half, restricting Watford to a single shot on goal, and nearly added to their lead when Iwobi's curling effort was tipped over by Gomes. Danny Welbeck went close as Arsenal kept the pressure on, but it was the impressive Iwobi who doubled their advantage seven minutes before the break, following up his strike against Everton with his second senior goal. Sanchez celebrates his first-half strike The young winger capped a flowing Arsenal move with a first-time finish, but lax marking from Etienne Capoue drew the ire of Watford manager Quique Sanchez Flores, who substituted the midfielder before half-time. But it did little to stem the tide as Bellerin extended Arsenal's lead via the aid of a deflection two minutes after the interval. The former Watford loanee saw his low shot strike Ben Watson, wrong-footing Gomes to put Arsenal in firm control. They threatened to run riot as Iwobi then struck the crossbar before Gomes denied Ozil and Sanchez in quick succession. Quique Sanchez Flores was disappointed to see his side fall to a 4-0 defeat Quique Sanchez Flores was disappointed to see his side fall to a 4-0 defeat The visitors almost pulled a goal back when Sebastian Prodl's header was cleared off the line by Nacho Monreal, and Ospina stayed alert to palm clear Deeney's snap-shot with 20 minutes to play. But Arsenal put the icing on the cake when Walcott, who replaced Iwobi to a rousing ovation for the Nigeria international, swept home from Joel Campbell's cross. Just moments before Anya had wasted Watford's best opening, unselfishly heading back across goal for Deeney when well placed to test Ospina himself. Theo Walcott turns home Arsenal's fourth in the 90th minute It summed up a disjointed performance from the away side, who face Everton next at Vicarage Road. As for Arsenal, they travel to West Ham before back-to-back home games against Crystal Palace and West Brom. Soccer Saturday verdict - Matt Le Tissier The game was more one-sided than the scoreline would suggest, it was an absolute walk in the park for Arsenal. They dominated possession from the first few minutes, got the goal early and Watford weren't at the races. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger believes his side are still in the title race Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger believes his side are still in the title race Quique Sanchez Flores made his first substitution after 38 minutes, just after the second Arsenal goal. He made another change at half-time in an attempt to change things up because they were nowhere near the pace. Arsenal scored a very early goal in the second half and it was game over, from that point on the Gunners let their foot off the gas and coasted through.

Bournemouth Manchester City maintained their hold of fourth spot in the Premier League with a comfortable 4-0 win at Bournemouth on Saturday afternoon. The visitors found themselves 3-0 ahead after just 19 minutes thanks to strikes from Fernando, the returning Kevin De Bruyne and Sergio Aguero - his 17th league goal of the campaign. Substitute Aleksandar Kolarov then added a fourth in stoppage time at the end of the game to see City extend their lead over fifth-placed West Ham to three points, while Bournemouth remain 13th. Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe made two alterations to the team that lost 3-0 at Tottenham before the international break, with Josh King fit enough to lead the line. City, meanwhile, made five changes from the side that lost 1-0 at home to Manchester United last time out, the most important of which saw De Bruyne return after two months out with a knee injury. Manchester City's Argentinian striker Sergio Aguero (L) jumps to head home their third goal And the Belgian forward reminded everyone just what City have been missing in recent weeks with a virtuoso first-half display as the visitors raced into an early 3-0 lead. City's opening goal came via the first corner of the game as Jesus Navas' delivery from the right somehow made its way to Fernando, lurking near the penalty spot. Manuel Pellegrini believes the 4-0 win against is the perfect preparation for PSG Manuel Pellegrini believes the 4-0 win against is the perfect preparation for PSG However, the Brazilian still did well to hook a volley past Bournemouth goalkeeper Artur Boruc for a seventh-minute opener. Five minutes later and Manuel Pellegrini's men had doubled their lead after Burnley defender Charlie Daniels was caught in possession trying to dribble his way out of his penalty area. Aguero stole the ball, though, and after a neat one-two with Silva, the latter's clever layoff was coolly passed into the back of the net by De Bruyne. That assist was the Spanish playmaker's 11th of the season and only in the 2011/12 campaign has he managed more, when he registered 15. Kevin De Bruyne got on the scoresheet on his return from injury Kevin De Bruyne got on the scoresheet on his return from injury The visitors scored again seven minutes later as De Bruyne sent Navas racing clear down the right flank. The Spaniard then hung a cross up to the far post, where Aguero somehow managed to beat Adam Smith to head home a third, despite Steve Cook's presence on the goal-line. That was effectively game over, with Fernandinho almost adding a fourth for City, only for his shot from the edge of the box to beat Boruc, but not the bar. Meanwhile, the Cherries' sole effort on goal before half-time came early on, but King dragged his effort wide of Willy Caballero's far post from a tight angle. City defender Aleksandar Kolarov celebrates after scoring their fourth goal In fact, the Argentine 'keeper was a virtual spectator as he deputised for City's injured No 1 Joe Hart, with the second half simply an exercise of protecting players ahead of their trip to Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League quarter-finals on Wednesday night. As such, Pellegrini opted to substitute all three of his key men - Aguero, Silva and De Bruyne - with the latter removed from the fray just before the hour-mark, although not before he came to close to scoring a second, only for Boruc to beat away his well-struck volley. Eddie Howe was disappointed with his side's 4-0 home defeat Eddie Howe was disappointed with his side's 4-0 home defeat There was further good news for City following the return of Samir Nasri after a long-term calf injury, with the France midfielder given a useful run-out in the final quarter of the game. The real icing on the cake, though, was provided by another substitute after Serbia international full-back Kolarov - playing in midfield - cut in from the left flank, before rifling an unstoppable shot past Boruc. Fernando of Manchester City scores his team's first goal Soccer Saturday verdict - Alan McInally City were very good in the first half, they were 3-0 up in the first 19 minutes. They went from first to top gear immediately and it was too much for Bournemouth to handle. The Cherries were completely shell-shocked, they hadn't managed to get into any sort of rhythm. City cantered to victory, David Silva, Kevin De Bruyne, Aguero and Jesus Navas were superb. Aleksandar Kolarov's scored City's fourth in style and the scoreline doesn't do justice to how well they played. Goodness knows where this City team has been this season, they have to ensure they repeat this performance for their remaining fixtures to finish in the top four.

they beat Newcastle 3-2 to move four points clear of the relegation zone. Substitute Aleksandar Mitrovic twice pegged the Canaries back, netting after Timm Klose had opened the scoring before tucking away a penalty with less than five minutes to go after Dieumerci Mbokani had put Norwich back in front. But, with the game seemingly heading for a draw, Olsson popped up in the box to fire home the winner in the third minute of stoppage time.

The result leaves Newcastle second from bottom, with Rafa Benitez's side now six points behind Norwich in 17th. Norwich were by far the better side early on and only a combination of wasteful finishing and a couple of fine saves from Newcastle goalkeeper Karl Darlow - making just his second Premier League appearance - kept it level for most of the first half. Mbokani had the ball in the back of the net after 17 minutes, but it was correctly ruled after he had strayed into an offside position before receiving Jonny Howson's pass. Aleksandar Mitrovic believes his side didn't deserve to lose and says there are seven finals left Aleksandar Mitrovic believes his side didn't deserve to lose and says there are seven finals left Darlow, Newcastle's third-choice stopper who was replacing the injured Rob Elliot, then made a couple of fine saves in quick succession just after the half-hour mark to keep out Robbie Brady then Mbokani, but he could do nothing to prevent Norwich's opener. In the second minute of stoppage time, Brady whipped a fine, inswinging free-kick right onto the head of Klose, who had risen highest in the box to steer the ball home. Jonathan Howson of Norwich City and Andros Townsend of Newcastle United Newcastle boss Benitez responded immediately after the break, throwing on Ayoze Perez for Cheick Tiote, but it was the introduction of Mitrovic just after the hour that made the difference for the away side. The striker offered an immediate threat, and found the equaliser after 71 minutes when his header from Andros Townsend's cross nicked the head of Ryan Bennett and looped over the unfortunate John Ruddy. Rafael Benitez says the reaction of his team in the second half was good Rafael Benitez says the reaction of his team in the second half was good Just three minutes later, though, Norwich were back in front through Mbokani. His finishing was lacking in the first half, but the striker showed his clinical edge in cutting inside from the left, charging into the box and thundering a strike into the top corner. With less than five minutes to go, Mitrovic appeared to nick a point for the away side, firing a penalty past Ruddy after Norwich midfielder Gary O'Neil had handled in the box. But in the 93rd minute Howson pulled a low ball back into the path of Olsson, and he fired it low and hard into Darlow's bottom corner to send Carrow Road wild. Martin Olsson scored a late winner for Norwich in their clash against Newcastle Martin Olsson scored a late winner for Norwich in their clash against Newcastle Paul Merson's Soccer Saturday verdict It looks like Newcastle will be relegated now. Norwich's goal at the end was massive. Benitez will be wondering why he didn't play Mitrovic from the start, they wouldn't have lost if he had started him - he was absolutely outstanding. After Newcastle pulled the game back to 2-2 they looked like the only team that was going to score. John Ruddy made an unbelievable save to deny Papiss Cisse and then Olsson drills the ball home at the other end for what could be a priceless victory. Norwich played very well for 70 minutes, they passed the ball around well. I worry for Newcastle now, Rafa organises teams and makes them difficult to beat, I'm not sure if he can send teams out to win football matches.

back from two goals down to draw 2-2 with Stoke City at the Britannia Stadium. Ibrahim Afellay, who celebrated his 30th birthday on Saturday, headed the hosts in front on 13 minutes before Bojan Krkic marked his return to the first team with a brilliant solo strike eight minutes after the break. Stoke appeared firmly in control until Gylfi Sigurdsson's 68th-minute strike reduced the deficit, and then Alberto Paloschi's deflected effort 11 minutes from time completed the turnaround for Francesco Guidolin's side. Failure to convert an assured display into victory will have frustrated Potters boss Mark Hughes, who saw his side miss the chance to move up to seventh in the table. Ibrahim Afellay of Stoke City celebrates scoring his team's first goal against Swansea The point for Swansea sees them move 10 points clear of the relegation zone with just six games of the season to play. Both managers made three changes ahead of kick-off, the most notable of which seeing Jack Butland replaced by Jakob Haugaard in goal for Stoke following his season-ending ankle injury while on England duty. Gylfi Sigurdsson of Swansea City scores against Stoke City Despite the Swans having the better of the opening exchanges, it was Stoke who drew first blood. Marko Arnautovic got the better of Federico Fernandez before crossing for Afellay to head assuredly past Lukasz Fabianksi from six yards. Arnautovic was a constant threat down the left and his low cross on 20 minutes almost lured Fernandez to turn into his own net, but, crucially for the Swans, the ball nestled in the side-netting. Stoke's Ibrahim Afellay celebrates after scoring Stoke did well in keeping the Swansea attack at bay, while Joselu spurned the chance to double the hosts' lead when he steered Glenn Whelan's inch-perfect cross straight at Fabianksi on 26 minutes. The fit-again Bojan, making his first appearance since March 12, showed what Stoke have been missing in recent weeks shortly after the half-hour mark, bursting away from Leon Britton and laying Afellay through, but the Dutchman sliced his effort wide. And that was the theme of the first half for the Potters as they failed to convert their promising build-up play into goals, Joselu striking the post from an offside position at the end of a free-flowing attack on 43 minutes. Giannelli Imbula of Stoke City under pressure from Bafetimbi Gomis And that inability to add to their lead almost came back to haunt Stoke as Haugaard was called into his first save of the half a minute later, denying Jack Cork's low, drilled shot to ensure the hosts led at the break. Stoke are yet to taste a defeat in the league in matches in which they have scored first, and that appeared to be the case again when Bojan was allowed to run unchallenged towards the Swansea area before picking out the bottom corner on 53 minutes. But Swansea reduced the deficit against the run of play as Sigurdsson's smart swivel and shot beat Haugaard, courtesy of a slight deflection. Jakob Haugaard makes a save during the match between Stoke City and Swansea City The unlikely turnaround was completed 11 minutes later as substitute Paloschi was afforded time to turn on the edge of the area, before his deflected effort found its way past Stoke's Danish 'keeper as the Swans snatched a point.

Sam Allardyce's side piled on the pressure in the second half but Fabio Borini and Jermain Defoe were denied by Ben Foster as a stubborn Albion side held on to claim a share of the spoils. With Norwich beating Newcastle, Sunderland's fourth draw in a row means they slip four points adrift of safety. They will be disappointed to come away with just the one point, however, as the visitors, who started the afternoon closer to the Champions League spots than the relegation zone, failed to register a shot on target. Jermain Defoe of Sunderland reacts after missing a chance Defoe had the first real chance of the match when he got on the end of Younes Kaboul's low ball into the box before attempting a back-heel flick but Foster got across well to save at his near post. The game may have been short of real quality in the opening stages but there was plenty of endeavour and full-blooded challenges, with Claudio Yacob, in particular, lucky not to pick up his 10th yellow card of the season. Instead, it was Sunderland captain Kaboul who picked up the first booking of the match for a late lunge on Sandro. Lamine Kone (right) looks for the ball with Jonathan Leko, who made his Premier League debut, watching on Defoe was a constant menace to the West Brom defence and went close again after 20 minutes when he picked up a pass from Patrick van Aanholt in the box and turned Jonny Evans before dragging his effort just wide. The 33-year-old should have opened the scoring on the half-hour mark when Wahbi Khazri delivered an excellent curling ball on to the edge of the six-yard box but Defoe somehow completely failed to make contact with the cross. Khazri was then involved in two incidents before the half-time whistle, first going down in the box after colliding with Sandro, before releasing Lee Cattermole, whose chipped effort was palmed away by Foster. Salomon Rondon (left) and Jermain Defoe compete for the ball The home side started the second half with real purpose and were unlucky not to take the lead on a couple of occasions. West Brom goalkeeper Ben Foster gives credit to their opponents West Brom goalkeeper Ben Foster gives credit to their opponents Jan Kirchhoff bundled his way into the West Brom box after being set up by Borini but his effort was stopped by the face of Foster. Defoe was then put through by Cattermole but his shot was just deflected wide for a corner before Borini's powerful effort from the edge of the box was pushed away by Foster. Allardyce issues instructions from the touchline The Italian thought he had opened the scoring shortly afterwards when he met DeAndre Yedlin's cross on the run but his first-time volley whistled just wide of the post. Van Aanholt was next to try his luck but his free-kick from 30 yards whipped just wide of the woodwork. West Brom were barely a threat going forward but Tony Pulis took the opportunity to give 16-year-old Jonathan Leko his Premier League debut from the bench as he replaced Saido Berahino with a little over 10 minutes remaining. The hosts kept pushing for the winner in the closing stages but found Foster in a determined mood, with the goalkeeper reacting well to push Borini's curling effort wide. Dame N'Doye's goal was disallowed in the fourth minute of injury time The England shot-stopper came to West Brom's rescue again with a minute remaining when Yann M'Vila slipped Defoe through on goal but the striker smashed his effort straight into Foster's legs from 10 yards. Sunderland thought they had won the game in the fourth minute of time added on but substitute Dame N'Doye had strayed offside before finding the net. Sunderland defender Youness Kaboul highlights the 'brilliant' performance from Ben Foster Sunderland defender Youness Kaboul highlights the 'brilliant' performance from Ben Foster Charlie Nicholas' Soccer Saturday verdict This was another missed opportunity for Sunderland. Big Sam has been asking for the clean sheet, and he got another clean sheet, but they didn't get the goals. It is a manager's nightmare. There wasn't much fluency in their play and West Brom were decent. Sunderland increased the tempo in the second half, Fabio Borini had a couple of chances but his finishing was amiss. The chance of the match fell to Jermain Defoe, the man you would it to fall to, his first touch excellent but he couldn't get the bend on the ball Ben Foster was equal to it. This is another chance gone for Sunderland to save their season.

"report": "Cheikhou Kouyate of West Ham United is shown a red card by referee Mark Clattenburg A controversial red card for Cheikhou Kouyate proved costly for West Ham as they were held to a 2-2 draw by Crystal Palace at Upton Park. The Hammers led 2-1 at the break thanks to Dimitri Payet's stunning free-kick at the end of the half, after Manuel Lanzini had cancelled out Damien Delaney's opening goal. But Palace grew into the game in the second half and were aided when Kouyate was sent off for a challenge on Dwight Gayle. Alan Pardew says he thought the red card for Cheikhou Kouyate was harsh Alan Pardew says he thought the red card for Cheikhou Kouyate was harsh That proved decisive as Gayle - who was introduced as a substitute at half-time - scored the equaliser minutes later to earn a valuable point for Palace. The visitors went ahead in the 14th minute when Bakary Sako's in-swinging free-kick bounced awkwardly in front of Adrian and he palmed the ball straight to Delaney, who headed it into the net. That lead lasted less than three minutes however as West Ham hit straight back. Palace failed to clear a cross from the right and the ball fell to Lanzini, who took a touch before confidently rifling the ball into the bottom corner. Palace had a glorious chance to restore their lead just after the half-hour mark when Angelo Ogbonna misjudged Pape Souare's cross from the left but it caught Jason Puncheon by surprise and he could only divert the ball over the bar with his thigh. Diafra Sakho came close to giving the Hammers the lead soon after when he outjumped Mile Jedinak at the back post before heading a Payet corner inches wide. After his heroics for France against Russia in midweek, Payet was largely quiet for much of the opening half but that ended in the 44th minute when he was hacked down by Joel Ward on the edge of the box. Dimitri Payet of West Ham celebrates scoring his team's second goal against Crystal Palace The Frenchman got up to curl an absolutely stunning free-kick right into the top far corner, leaving Wayne Hennessey rooted to the spot. Kouyate almost cost West Ham a goal in the 66th minute when he under hit a back pass to Adrian and the ball fell to Joe Ledley who teed up Bakary Sako to shoot from the edge of the box but Aaron Cresswell did well to get back and clear off the line. Dwight Gayle says there is no doubt his side will get out the bad run they are currently Dwight Gayle says there is no doubt his side will get out the bad run they are currently Things got worse for Kouyate two minutes later when he miscontrolled a pass in midfield before lunging in on Gayle as he nicked the ball away. Ironically, it was a role reversal from this fixture earlier in the season when Gayle was sent off for a similar offence on Kouyate, with Mark Clattenburg the referee on both occasions. That red card gave Palace a boost and they almost levelled immediately when Bolasie did brilliantly to beat Cresswell down the right before sending in a perfect cross to the back post, but an unmarked Sako badly miscued his attempted left-foot volley. The reprieve was short-lived for West Ham however, as Palace got their equaliser minutes later. Dwight Gayle of Crystal Palace scores his team's second goal past Adrian of West Ham Souare provided a consistent attacking threat from left-back throughout the game and he was the source of the goal as he sent in a dangerous cross from the left which Winston Reid missed and Ogbonna only managed to clear as far as Gayle, who calmly passed the ball into the bottom right corner. Both sides pressed for a winner in the closing stages but neither could engineer one and instead settled for a result that doesn't greatly help either team. Fifth-placed West Ham lose valuable ground in the race for the top four while Palace remain without a win in the league since December and sit just seven points above the relegation zone in 16th.

missed the chance to put pressure on Premier League leaders Leicester after being held to a 1-1 draw at Liverpool on Saturday Night Football. With the Foxes not in action until Sunday, Spurs could have closed the gap at the top of the table to two points. But they fell behind in the 51st minute at Anfield when Philippe Coutinho finished from Daniel Sturridge's pass. Harry Kane equalised in the 63rd minute with a fine finish but Spurs could not grab a winner and will now wait anxiously to see how the Foxes fare against Southampton. Mauricio Pochettino's side had their chances at Anfield but were also indebted to goalkeeper Hugo Lloris for several important stops. After Simon Mignolet punched away an early shot from Christian Eriksen, Lloris got down sharply to keep out an attempted clearance from Heung-Min Son. The France international then twice denied Adam Lallana, palming away an effort from the edge of the box before diving at full stretch to keep out a volley. Jurgen Klopp says Liverpool allowed Tottenham back into the game Jurgen Klopp says Liverpool allowed Tottenham back into the game Sturridge had the best chance of the half when he was played in by Coutinho, but he shot straight at Lloris. Kane dragged a shot across goal at the other end before Dele Alli hit a dipping half-volley that Mignolet held. The breakthrough eventually arrived six minutes into the second half when Coutinho exchanged passes with Sturridge and then placed a shot into the corner. Coutinho (left) slotted home to give Liverpool the lead Coutinho almost returned the favour with a pin-point cross that Sturridge headed over the bar. But, after Son had volleyed wide, Spurs levelled when Eriksen did well to keep the ball in play and pass into the box for Kane, who turned and finished superbly. The goal was Kane's sixth in his last four league matches and set a new Spurs Premier League record of 22 in a season. Harry Kane (right) equalised with his 22nd league goal of the season But he could not add to his tally in a frantic final half-hour that saw both teams create chances. Mignolet got down well to save from Eriksen, while Coutinho slid a ball right across the face of goal. The Brazilian then dragged a shot narrowly wide with Lloris rooted to the spot before Eriksen curled a free-kick just wide and Toby Alderweireld headed past the post in injury-time.

The striker headed home from close range in the 83rd minute at St James' Park to arrest a run of six straight derby defeats for the home side. Jermain Defoe had given Sunderland the lead on the stroke of half-time and it looked for all the world like the Black Cats would hold on for victory until Mitrovic's late effort. It was Rafa Benitez's first point as Newcastle manager after defeat in his opening game at Leicester on Monday night, but the result leaves both sides in the relegation zone after Norwich won on Saturday. Sam Allardyce's only change from the side that drew 1-1 at Southampton a fortnight ago was to bring in Defoe, who came off the bench that day to score. Jermain Defoe gave Sunderland the lead And the former England striker had a couple of decent opportunities to open the scoring early on in the first half. After just three minutes he had the chance to turn and shoot inside the box, but could only fire over the bar, then he hit the side netting with a low effort 16 minutes later. However, he was not be denied after 44 minutes. Wahbi Khazri took a short corner into the path of Fabio Borini on the edge of the area, whose powerful effort was palmed away well by Rob Elliot. Newcastle boss Rafa Benitez gives his reaction to Sky Sports Newcastle boss Rafa Benitez gives his reaction to Sky Sports Unfortunately for the Newcastle goalkeeper, though, the ball fell right back into the heart of his own area, and Chancel Mbemba could only head his attempted clearance as far as Defoe. And, cool as you like, the 33-year-old took a touch and steered it through the crowd of bodies and back past Elliot. Newcastle had their chances in the first half, with Moussa Sissoko and Mitrovic both spurning opportunities, but Sunderland deserved the lead that left Benitez with a huge half-time team talk. Goalkeeper Rob Elliot failed to stop Defoe from scoring And whatever the Spaniard said must have worked as Newcastle came out of the blocks at full tilt in the second half, nearly finding the equaliser within two minutes. Chancel Mbemba headed a corner into the path of Ayoze Perez, and only the superb reaction work of Yann M'Vila on the line kept the ball from going in. Sunderland boss Sam Allardyce gives his reaction to Sky Sports Sunderland boss Sam Allardyce gives his reaction to Sky Sports Newcastle continued to pile on the pressure as chances from Mitrovic and Sissoko saw chances go begging again, before Sunderland nearly doubled their lead just before the hour mark. Elliot, however, reacted brilliantly to keep out Patrick Van Aanholt's fierce strike from close range. It looked as though Sunderland would hold on for a victory that would have lifted them to 17th, but a defence that hasn't kept a clean sheet since November finally creaked seven minutes from time, as Mitrovic headed in at the far post from Georginio Wijnaldum's fine cross. Rafael Benitez took charge of his firstTyne-Wear derby The Serbian striker has become a hero at St James' Park this season, and was booked in the aftermath of the goal for whipping off his shirt and celebrating with a fan who had found his way onto the pitch. And there would be further drama for Mitrovic late on as he appeared to be knocked out after colliding with Lamine Kone in second-half stoppage time as he tried to get onto the end of a cross, forcing Newcastle to finish the game at a rapturous St James' Park with 10 men.

Mane inspired a stunning second-half Southampton fightback as they came from 2-0 down to beat Liverpool 3-2. Liverpool looked to be cruising to victory at St Mary's as goals from Philippe Coutinho and Daniel Sturridge put them in control at the break. But, boosted by the half-time introductions of Mane and Victor Wanyama, Saints came storming back. Mane atoned for having a penalty saved by cutting the deficit in the 64th minute before Graziano Pelle struck a fine equaliser in the 83rd minute. The comeback was complete moments later as Mane capitalised on indecision in the Liverpool defence to coolly finish past Simon Mignolet and spark wild celebrations amongst the home fans and Saints boss Ronald Koeman. Mane celebrates Southampton's winner The dramatic victory sees Saints maintain their push for a European place while Liverpool have work to do in their final nine games to make up ground. Fresh from signing a new long-term deal on Friday, Jurgen Klopp handed Jon Flanagan the captain's armband for the first time at St Mary's, with Jordan Henderson on the bench. Jose Fonte returned for Southampton, who were aggrieved not to be awarded an early penalty when Shane Long went down in the box under a challenge from Dejan Lovren. Pelle then volleyed a tricky chance over the bar, but it was Liverpool who took the lead after 17 minutes as Coutinho cut in from the left and hit a perfectly-curled strike across goal and into the far corner. Daniel Sturridge put Liverpool 2-0 ahead While there were questions over whether Fraser Forster should have saved it, there was nothing he could do about Liverpool's second shortly afterwards. The visitors countered at pace, with Coutinho slipping the ball down the wing for Origi and the Belgian passing into the box for Sturridge, who bought a yard with a clever stepover and then finished well. The double setback knocked the stuffing out of Saints and they were fortunate not to fall further behind when Joe Allen was through on goal but saw his shot saved by Forster. The Saints keeper then blocked a low effort from Sturridge before Allen had a goal ruled out for offside. Dejan Lovren (left) and Graziano Pelle compete for the ball Saints offered little threat before the break but the introductions of Mane and Wanyama gave them a much-needed lift. They were handed a chance to cut the deficit from the penalty spot early in the second half as Martin Skrtel, who came on at half-time for Liverpool in place of Dejan Lovren, was penalised for grabbing Pelle's shirt. Mane stepped up to take the penalty but saw Mignolet dive to his right and save. Ronald Koeman was pleased with Southampton's mentality Ronald Koeman was pleased with Southampton's mentality Unflustered, Saints continued to press and they cut the deficit in the 64th minute when Mane held off Sakho in the box and fired into the corner. Substitute Christian Benteke missed a fantastic chance to restore Liverpool's two-goal lead when he was played in by Adam Lallana but dragged his shot wide. It would prove a costly miss as Saints snatched victory in the final 10 minutes. Pelle equalised in the 83rd minute with a fine left-foot strike from just outside the box before Liverpool failed to clear their lines and were punished by Mane, who again finished well past Mignolet to snatch an unlikely three points.

The United academy product's 16th-minute strike proved to be the decisive goal as United ground out a much-needed victory courtesy of Rashford's fifth goal on his eighth appearance for the club. City's cause was hampered by the loss of Raheem Sterling and Joe Hart in either half to injuries, and they failed to really test David de Gea, Sergio Aguero's header against the post the closest they came to equalising. The result sees United maintain their quest for Champions League qualification and was the perfect tonic as they atoned for their Europa League exit to Liverpool in style. City remain 15 points adrift of leaders Leicester with just eight games to play and are now mired in the race for the top four, with United, level with fifth-placed West Ham, just a point off their city rivals. With Vincent Kompany's recurring calf injury marring City's midweek progression into the Champions League quarter-finals, Martin Demichelis was drafted in to partner Eliaquim Mangala in City's only change from Wednesday's goalless draw with Dynamo Kiev. Rashford opens the scoring for Manchester United at the Etihad Louis van Gaal, meanwhile, removed Marouane Fellaini from the firing line after the midfielder bore the brunt of the criticism that followed Thursday's Europa League exit against Liverpool, Morgan Schneiderlin replacing the Belgian. City made the better start and could have an early lead but, after Matteo Darmian failed to clear Sterling's cross, Jesus Navas produced a finish fitting of a man with just one goal this season, dragging wide on seven minutes. Rashford celebrates with team-mates his 16th-minute goal put Manchester United 1-0 up against their City rivals City continued on the front foot but Navas again couldn't convert Sterling's pass as De Gea saved with his feet. And they were made to pay as United took the lead against the run of play. Juan Mata and Schneiderlin combined to release the 18-year-old onto the City defence, he then burst past Demichelis before slotting through Hart to become the youngest scorer in the fixture in the Premier League era. Manchester City's Raheem Sterling receives medical treatment It could have been two shortly after, but Anthony Martial was thwarted by Hart after a neat pirouette to fashion space. Demichelis missed the chance to atone for his part in United's goal, heading David Silva's free-kick wide on 22 minutes, before Sterling was forced off with a groin problem following Mata's challenge. Manchester United and Manchester City clash after Rashford's penalty appeal With Fernando replacing Sterling, Toure was given empowered to roam forward and he almost had an immediate effect, curling wide just after the half-hour mark. The half drew to a close with Rashford going to ground in the area under Demichelis' rash challenge, but referee Michael Oliver opted against awarding United a penalty as a melee between both sets of players ensued. Man Utd boss Louis van Gaal reflects on United's win Man Utd boss Louis van Gaal reflects on United's win The second half got off to the worst start for City as Demichelis' loose back pass forced Hart into a rushed clearance, with the England stopper joining Sterling in departing the game prematurely with a suspected calf injury.

Harry Kane opened the scoring in the opening minute before adding a second 15 minutes later as Mauricio Pochettino's side simply outclassed Bournemouth in the first 45 minutes. Spurs lacked the same intensity and verve after the break but were still able to add a third through Christian Eriksen in the 52nd minute before coasting through the remainder of the match. The victory takes Tottenham back to within five points of Leicester at the top of the table ahead of the international break, with seven games to play. Harry Kane says if Tottenham continue their fine recent form there is no reason they cannot win the title Harry Kane says if Tottenham continue their fine recent form there is no reason they cannot win the title Many fans had barely made it to their seats by the time Kane turned in Kyle Walker's cross to give Tottenham the lead inside the first minute. The full-back having collected Hugo Lloris' pass and driven forward before delivering a ball that required only the slightest touch from Kane to send it beyond Artur Boruc. Spurs remained in total control and barely allowed Bournemouth a kick in the opening stages so it was little surprise when they added second in the 16th minute. Kevin Wimmer's pass from the back dissected the visitors' midfield allowing Dele Alli the time and space to turn before sliding the ball through to Kane who made no mistake with a left-foot finish past Boruc. Kane scores his second goal of the afternoon Eriksen could have made it three soon after, latching on to Toby Alderweireld's pass over the top, but hit the bouncing ball high and wide. It looked like being a procession as the half went on, Danny Rose shooting into the side netting and Alli having a goal chalked off for offside, but Bournemouth were at least able to create one chance late in the half - Steve Cook heading Max Gradel's free-kick just over the bar. Eddie Howe says Bournemouth paid the price for a slow start and need to learn from top teams like Tottenham Eddie Howe says Bournemouth paid the price for a slow start and need to learn from top teams like Tottenham Eddie Howe made a double change at half-time, sending on Lewis Grabban and Eunan O'Kane, but despite a better opening to the half from his side, they conceded a third seven minutes after the restart - Eriksen tapping in the rebound after Boruc parried Kane's speculative effort back into a central position. After that Spurs eased off and sat back, inviting Bournemouth on. However, the visitors failed to create any real chances of note with Alderweireld and Kevin Wimmer snuffing out any potential opportunities for the visitors as quickly as they appeared. Joshua King and Kevin Wimmer compete for the ball The one time Tottenham did look stretched, as Grabban burst down the right and into the box, a combination of Eric Dier and Alderweireld averted the danger. The home side briefly threaten to come back to life in the final stages, Eriksen brilliantly spinning between two Bournemouth defenders before squaring to Alli who scuffed the shot wide and Kane fizzing a long range effort just off target, but another goal was not forthcoming. It finished 3-0 and Tottenham can now look ahead with renewed confidence to a trip to Anfield after the international break.

Arsene Wenger's side took the lead after just seven minutes through Danny Welbeck, before Alex Iwobi extended their advantage with a debut goal on his first-ever Premier League start for the club. As a result, the Gunners are 11 points behind leaders Leicester City, albeit with a game in hand on the leaders, while Everton remain in 12th. The visitors made just the one change from the team that exited the Champions League at the hands of Barcelona in midweek, with Francis Coquelin replacing the injured Mathieu Flamini. Everton, meanwhile, brought in Muhamed Besic for a rare appearance in midfield, with the Bosnian replacing the suspended Gareth Barry. The home side, who were looking to build on their impressive 2-0 win over Chelsea in the FA Cup last weekend, almost made a dream start through Seamus Coleman. However, despite getting across his man at the near post, the Irish right-back's early flick from Tom Cleverley's right-wing corner beat David Ospina, only to strike the outside of the post. Danny Welbeck rounds Joel Robles before scoring Arsenal's opening goal That near miss appeared to to stir Arsenal into life, though, with the Gunners soon ahead after some lovely build-up play involving Mesut Ozil and Alexis Sanchez. After the Chile international slipped Welbeck down the right-hand channel of the area, the forward rounded advancing Everton goalkeeper Joel Robles, before scoring into an empty net. That early breakthrough then saw the Gunners take control of the contest and the visitors could, and really should, have doubled their lead before the half-hour mark through both Iwobi and Ozil. Arsenal were also unfortunate not to be awarded a penalty after 35 minutes when Besic appeared to upend Alexis in the box, only for referee Mark Clattenburg to wave away their protests. However, after Besic tested Ospina with a well-struck shot from distance, the Gunners did score again three minutes before half-time through Iwobi's first-ever strike for the club, although Everton boss Roberto Martinez will be disappointed with the manner of the goal. Collecting possession just outside his own area after Alexis had robbed Besic, Arsenal right-back Hector Bellerin's lofted ball over the top caught Everton's back four square, with Iwobi running on to the pass before firing through the Robles' legs. Welbeck (2nd L) celebrates wit his team-mates Martinez brought on John Stones for Besic at the break, with the Toffees switching to a back three as Coleman and Leighton Baines were pushed further forward into wing-back roles. But despite enjoying the lion's share of possession in the second half, Everton struggled to create any real clear-cut openings, especially for in-form striker Romelu Lukaku, who had found the back of the net 25 times this season, including in his four previous encounters. In fact, the only real scare for Arsenal came when back-up 'keeper Ospina was involved in a nasty-looking collision with Lukaku, but after lengthy treatment, the Colombian was able to continue.

late penalty to deny West Ham A controversial late Cesc Fabregas penalty earned Chelsea a 2-2 draw against West Ham at Stamford Bridge. The Hammers were heading for a place in the top four until Fabregas equalised with a penalty a minute from time after Michail Antonio brought Ruben Loftus-Cheek down, but replays showed the contact was outside the area. Manuel Lanzini had put West Ham ahead with a fine effort from range, before Fabregas equalised late in the opening period with a 25-yard free-kick. Andy Carroll celebrates with his team-mates after scoring with his first touch West Ham hit the bar through Aaron Cresswell in the second half, but Andy Carroll regained their lead with his first touch just second after coming on with 25 minutes remaining. The result leaves West Ham in fifth, a point behind Manchester City in fourth, while Chelsea stay 10th, 10 points off the top four. The draw also makes it mathematically impossible for Chelsea to retain the Premier League title they won by eight points last term. Chelsea made three changes from the side that lost 2-0 at Everton in the FA Cup last weekend, with John Terry returning to the starting line up. West Ham celebrate Carroll's goal in front of the travelling fans But it was West Ham, who made three changes themselves, who took the lead after 16 minutes. After being laid on by Dimitri Payet 25 yards from goal, Lanzini produced a superb, curling effort into the top right corner, past the despairing dive of Thibaut Courtois. Just before the half-hour mark, Chelsea had appeals for a penalty turned down by referee Robert Madley after the ball looked to have hit Enner Valencia's hand inside the area. Manuel Lanzini celebrates with team-mates after his opener It was West Ham who should have doubled their lead through Cresswell moments later, but the left-back's drive across the face of goal after being set up by Sakho on the left side of the area went just wide of Courtois' post. The visitors looked to be going into the break ahead, but Chelsea got themselves level in controversial fashion in first-half stoppage time. Before stepping up to take a free-kick 25 yards from goal, Fabregas rolled the ball back two yards, meaning the wall was set up behind the referee's vanishing spray 12 yards away, before the Spaniard cleared the wall and found the top corner with a fine curling effort, much to the West Ham players' dismay. Midfielder Willian in action for Chelsea in the first half The hosts took their momentum into the second half, and came close after Branislav Ivanovic's ball across the face of goal was turned just wide at an angle by Oscar. Cresswell was within inches of regaining West Ham's lead just before the hour mark, but struck the underside of the crossbar 12 yards out from the left side of the area. But just seconds after coming on, Carroll put the visitors ahead. Getting on the end of Payet's pass as West Ham broke, the striker scored with his first touch, stroking the ball past Courtois from 15 yards. West Ham boss Slaven Bilic was adamant that the penalty Chelsea were awarded shouldn't have been given West Ham boss Slaven Bilic was adamant that the penalty Chelsea were awarded shouldn't have been given One of Willian's umpteen corners found Fabregas with a clear header with 20 minutes remaining, but the midfielder could only put his effort over from eight yards. Carroll almost got a second with 10 minutes remaining, but saw his header from eight yards from Payet's corner beaten away by Courtois, before seeing another goal-bound header from a corner cleared off the line by Bertrand Traore. Then came the controversy, as substitute Loftus-Cheek was brought down as he ran through on goal by Antonio, but the contact looked to be outside the penalty area. Chelsea boss Guus Hiddink gives his reaction to Sky Sports after his side twice came from behind to draw 2-2 Chelsea boss Guus Hiddink gives his reaction to Sky Sports after his side twice came from behind to draw 2-2 Fabregas converted with aplomb from the spot to dent the Hammers' Champions League aspirations and spare themselves another home defeat. Soccer Saturday verdict - Charlie Nicholas West Ham would have been disappointed not to have won the game, especially after taking the lead twice. They are such a good side to watch, particularly in the final third. Lanzini scored a stunning opener and they looked the better of the two sides. Other than Fabregas and Willian, Chelsea offered little early on. But, after Fabregas' equaliser on half-time, Chelsea were right at it. West Ham suffered a cruel blow right at the end with Chelsea's penalty, it was harsh but it's a modern-day penalty.

Leicester retained their advantage at the top of the Premier League after a hard-fought 1-0 victory over Crystal Palace. Riyad Mahrez scored the only goal of the game after 34 minutes, finishing from Jamie Vardy's low cross. The Foxes were on the back foot for much of the second half but they held out as Kasper Schmeichel saved from Bakary Sako and Damien Delaney volleyed against the crossbar in injury-time. Victory briefly left the Foxes eight points clear of second-placed Tottenham, although they closed close the gap again on Sunday with a 3-0 win at home to Bournemouth, but the Foxes have just seven games left to seal their first top-flight title, and complete the fairy tale. Claudio Ranieri celebrates victory at Selhurst Park While Claudio Ranieri's side managed to earn their fourth 1-0 win in their last five matches, Palace are still without a victory in 2016 and have now lost a club-record six consecutive league games at home. Both sides were unchanged from their previous fixtures and there was little to choose between them in the early exchanges. The best opportunities of the opening 20 minutes both fell to Mahrez. The Algerian was unable to make contact with a cross from Shinji Okazaki and was then denied by Wayne Hennessey after being played in on goal by Danny Drinkwater. But Palace, aided by a tactical tweak, enjoyed an encouraging spell around the half-hour mark. Wilfried Zaha volleyed wide at the back post from Yannick Bolasie's cross before Bolasie missed the target with a header. Mahrez (left) tries to get away from Yohan Cabaye The wind was taken out of their sails, however, when the Foxes got the breakthrough after 34 minutes. Drinkwater slipped it into the box for Vardy and he crossed low for Mahrez to finish first time. Schmeichel kept the Foxes ahead with a smart save from Bolasie's deflected shot while Hennessey kept out Albrighton's shot at the other end. Palace made a double change at the break, bringing on Martin Kelly and Sako for Papa Souare and Emmanuel Adebayor, and although Leicester started the second half positively, with Okazaki firing just wide and then missing the target with a close-range header, it was the hosts who turned the screw as the half wore on, but with Adebayor off, they too often lacked a focal point in the box. Sako put in a few dangerous crosses and forced Schmeichel into a save after cutting in from the right, but otherwise Palace's threat was limited. They did manage to create one excellent chance in injury-time, only for Delaney to volley against the bar after Scott Dann headed a corner down for him on the penalty spot. Soccer Saturday verdict - Phil Thompson \"Leicester were fantastic in the first half. Some of the moves they created were nothing short of sensational, they cut through Palace. I was rubbing my eyes at the speed at which they got through the defence, it was absolutely fantastic. \"There were some absolutely terrific performances from the usual suspects. It wasn't Jamie Vardy or Mahrez today though, this result was down the Kante and Drinkwater. They were sensational. \"When Palace applied the pressure in the second half, Huth and Morgan were incredible.

Jonathan Walters, recalled to the starting line-up due to injuries, broke the deadlock early on, before Joselu doubled their advantage with a piece of individual magic six minutes into the second half. Troy Deeney set up a nervy finish with a close-range header with four minutes remaining, but City held on to claim maximum points over the FA Cup semi-finalists. Victory helped Mark Hughes' side leap above Liverpool and Southampton ahead of the pair's clash on Sunday, and to within a point of sixth-placed Manchester United. Joselu celebrates scoring Stoke's second with a delightful chip The home side, fresh from their cup upset at Arsenal last weekend were the first to threaten when Deeney found the club's top goalscorer Odion Ighalo down the right, but his low drive from just inside the area was well held by an alert Jack Butland. They fell behind slightly against the run of play thanks to a well-worked goal by Stoke after 18 minutes. Gianelli Imbula won the ball in the middle of the park and found influential Dutchman Ibrahim Afellay who had enough time to see Phil Bardsley in space wide right. The full-back delivered an inch-perfect cross for Walters to tap home with ease for his eighth goal of the season. Mark Hughes was pleased Stoke City put last week's defeat behind them with a win at Watford Mark Hughes was pleased Stoke City put last week's defeat behind them with a win at Watford Hughes' side felt they should have doubled their advantage after 36 minutes when Bardsley was allowed time to surge in behind the Hornets' backline. He delivered another teasing cross which was missed by Miguel Britos completely, allowing Walters to pounce at the far post for his fifth Premier League goal of the season. They had the ball in the back of the net shortly after through Marko Arnautovic, but the flag was raised, although replays seemed to suggest the Austria international was hard done by. Jose Manuel Jurado gets away from Glenn Whelan The hosts came close to going into the break on level terms when Geoff Cameron deflected the ball into the path of Jurado. The Spaniard rushed through on goal but then panicked and sliced his left-footer high over the crossbar. After the break Stoke deservedly doubled the advantage when Gomes' scuffed his free-kick straight to Walters who cleverly cushioned the ball through the gap for Joselu to run through and brilliantly lob the advancing 'keeper. Nordin Amrabat and Adlene Guedioura were brought on for Jurado and Valon Behrami as the Hornets looked to get back into the game. Quique Sanchez Flores felt Watford let their standards slip and could not match Stoke for energy or intensity Quique Sanchez Flores felt Watford let their standards slip and could not match Stoke for energy or intensity But it was Stoke who came close to adding a third through Afellay, although Gomes denied him thanks to an outstanding save. City could not bury their opponents with Arnautovic next to burst through on goal but was unable to slide his effort past Gomes. With time running out Watford set up a grandstand finish when Deeney met substitute Ikechi Anya's cross to head past Butland who, despite getting both hands to the ball, could not keep it out. Jonathan Walters felt Stoke's victory was comfortable and they could have won by a few more goals Jonathan Walters felt Stoke's victory was comfortable and they could have won by a few more goals Watford were unable to force an equaliser, however, and Stoke held on for maximum points. The Hornets remain in 14th position on 37 points but have now won just two of their last 13 Premier League matches. Soccer Saturday Verdict - Matt Le Tissier Matt Le Tissier reviews Stoke's 2-1 win over Watford Matt Le Tissier reviews Stoke's 2-1 win over Watford Watford weren't really at it after their FA Cup victory at Arsenal. Stoke got themselves a lead early on and, in fairness, looked comfortable before Joselu made it two just after the break. Gomes will not be happy with his clearance that lead to Stoke's second. He cleared the ball straight to Jon Walters on the halfway line, and credit to him, he cushioned the ball over the back four and Joselu finished it over the stranded 'keeper. At that point there was no coming back for Watford, they scored late on by didn't threaten after that and Stoke were good value.

The result ends a run of three without defeat for West Brom although, with 39 points already on the board, Tony Pulis' side look well clear of a potential relegation scrap. Norwich were given an early chance to take the lead when Brady was tripped on the edge of the box but the winger curled the free-kick over the bar. It set the tone for a first half full of endeavour but lacking in quality, certainly in the final third at either end. Saido Berahino worked himself half a yard of space just inside the Norwich area before hitting a wayward effort into the stands at one end before Russell Martin failed to make the most of Brady's right wing cross at the other.

The half's best effort came soon after from Claudio Yacob - a dominant presence in the middle of the park - as he powered a shot that just clipped the angle of post and bar having been teed up by Salomon Rondon. A good spell for Norwich followed but they were unable to create any chances of note and, three minutes before half-time, they almost gifted Albion the opener. Gary O'Neil's square pass allowed Stephane Sessegnon to intercept and drive into the box, only for the midfielder to slice the shot wide. The breakthrough came five minutes after the interval with Dieumerci Mbokani threading a pass through to Matt Jarvis inside the area and the winger looked to have fluffed the chance as he made a complete mess of his shot, the ball fell kindly for Brady to steer it home from close range. That was the game's first shot on target and, ultimately, it proved the only one as West Brom's push for an equaliser never materialised. Patrick Bamford and Jonny Evans tangle In fact, it was Norwich who looked the more likely to find another goal as Patrick Bamford fired wide with a shot on the turn from eight yards and Mbokani proved a constant nuisance for the Albion defence. The one negative for Norwich came as Brady was forced off, having initially attempted to play on, after falling and landing on his back after a challenge with Craig Dawson. However, even losing one of their standout performers on the day had little adverse effect and when West Brom did, belatedly and fleetingly, threaten through Rondon in stoppage time, Sebastien Bassong was on hand to intervene and ensure Norwich held on for all three points.

Norwich played very well, they all got into their shape, and things look a lot different to their display against Liverpool a few months ago. \"It was a great result for Norwich and it piles the pressure on Tyne-Wear derby tomorrow - if Newcastle lose at home then that really throws the cat among the pigeons. \"If Norwich continue playing in this manner they could be OK, they've earned two clean sheets and a bit of luck today to get the chance to win the game.\" Player ratings West Brom: Foster (6), Dawson (6), McAuley (6), Olsson (5), Evans (6), Sessegnon (6), Yacob (8), Fletcher (7), Gardner (6), Berahino (5), Rondon (6).

After competing well for 53 minutes, Villa switched off defensively and allowed Federico Fernandez to bundle home from close range. The goal drained all confidence out of the visitors, who have lost their last six games and are 12 points from safety with seven games remaining. Federico Fernandez (right) celebrates scoring Swansea's winning goal against Aston Villa Meanwhile, Swansea have now won five of their 10 games since Francesco Guidolin's appointment and pull 11 points clear of the relegation zone. Guidolin was back in the dugout after missing the last three games with a chest infection, but his presence on touchline didn't have an impact on his players as Joleon Lescott and Jordan Ayew both fired off target from presentable openings for Villa in the early stages. Remi Garde's men, who are without an away win since their opening day victory over Bournemouth, looked sharp with and without the ball as Swansea struggled to get their passing game going. Rudy Gestede and man of the match Ashley Williams compete for the ball Good chances were few and far between though. Ayew found space in box on 40 minutes but was denied by a fantastic saving tackle from Ashley Williams. The Swansea skipper was at it again minutes later to head a Rudy Gestede bicycle kick over the crossbar. Villa fans would have been hoping their team could kick-on after the break but despite having looked comfortable defensively, one mistake cost them dear. Swansea captain Ashley Williams praised the impact that Leon Britton made when he came on for Swansea in their win over Aston Villa. Swansea captain Ashley Williams praised the impact that Leon Britton made when he came on for Swansea in their win over Aston Villa. Gylfi Sigurdsson sent over a free-kick from deep which found Fernandez in acres of space in the penalty box. Brad Guzan came flying out of goal to deal with the cross but didn't commit his body to the challenge and ended up flapping the ball against the Swans centre-half. The ball tricked into the net - it was Swansea's only shot on target in the game. Villa's response was limited as the confidence gained from a spirited first-half display evaporated. However, Lescott should have done better on 64 minutes when meeting a Carlos Gil corner but turned the ball straight down the throat of Lukasz Fabianski. That was as good as it got for Villa, who struggled to create any openings in the final 25 minutes as Williams stood strong at the heart of the Swans backline. The victory all-but guarantees Swansea's Premier League survival while Villa need a footballing miracle.

Benitez suffered a 1-0 defeat in his first game as Newcastle manager on Monday. The Premier League leaders went in front through Okazaki's acrobatic finish on 25 minutes after Jamie Vardy, who appeared to be standing in an offside position when the cross came in, nodded across goal for his strike partner. Okazaki's acrobtaic finish sealed the points for Leicester Newcastle had missed the chance to go ahead when Ayoze Perez dragged his shot wide early on, while Moussa Sissoko and Siem de Jong both spurned promising opportunities to equalise after the break. The visitors had 13 shots to Leicester's 10 in an improved performance under new boss Benitez, and had a penalty claim turned down when Sissoko's shot struck Wes Morgan's arm, but the defeat leaves them second bottom with Sunderland to come in the Tyne-Wear derby next Sunday, live on Sky Sports. Leicester's Wes Morgan and Danny Drinkwater say they had to dig in to beat Newcastle Leicester's Wes Morgan and Danny Drinkwater say they had to dig in to beat Newcastle As for Leicester, who scored with their only shot on target at the King Power Stadium, the win means they will definitely stay top through to April with a visit to Crystal Palace up next. Benitez made two changes for his first game in charge as Aleksandar Mitrovic and Vurnon Anita replaced Paul Dummett and Emmanuel Riviere, and the visitors started the stronger. Rafael Benitez suffered defeat in his first match in charge of Newcastle They went close through Perez after just four minutes as the Spaniard flashed his shot just wide, before his teasing cross almost found Sissoko at the back post. But Leicester edged in front when Okazaki found the bottom corner with a stunning piece of improvisation for his fifth league goal of the season. Leicester manager Claudio Ranieri praised his side's spirit Leicester manager Claudio Ranieri praised his side's spirit Steven Taylor could only help on Marc Albrighton's cross to the back post, and when Vardy headed back across goal, Okazaki was on hand to fire an overhead kick past Elliot. Former Premier League referee Dermot Gallagher told Sky Sports after the game Vardy was correctly ruled onside because Taylor's header was unchallenged, deeming it a \"football action\", and leaving the Leicester man free in phase two to legitimately play the ball. Albrighton had the chance to double the hosts' lead immediately, but the winger flashed his shot wide of the far post. Okazaki celebrates the only goal of the game at the King Power Stadium Newcastle responded well to going behind and quickly settled back into their rhythm, but Sissoko and Mitrovic collided as the latter looked to pull the trigger in the box. And, with a sell-out King Power in full voice, Benitez's side struggled to carve out another opportunity before the break. Vardy battles Anita in the first half The Newcastle boss responded with his first change 10 minutes after half-time, and Andros Townsend's introduction made a difference. Sissoko wasted their clearest opportunity to level when he failed to pick out a team-mate after breaking past the Leicester defence on the hour mark, but Newcastle midfielder then set up Perez, whose low drive deflected narrowly wide of Kasper Schmeichel's near post. Newcastle manager Rafael Benitez focused on the positives following his first game in charge Newcastle manager Rafael Benitez focused on the positives following his first game in charge Mitrovic and Danny Simpson clashed as the visitors' frustration threatened to boil over, but referee Craig Pawson did well to defuse the situation. The Magpies continued to grow into the game as the final 10 minutes approached, and they had a penalty appeal ignored when Sissoko's powerful shot came back off Morgan with eight minutes to play.

Harry Kane scored goals either side of half-time as Tottenham beat Aston Villa 2-0 to move to within two points of Premier League leaders Leicester. The Tottenham striker missed a trio of first-half chances but eventually tucked one away on the stroke of half-time and added a second three minutes after the restart to take his goal tally to 22 for the season. The victory ends a run of three games without a win in all competitions and cranks up the pressure on Leicester ahead of their clash with Newcastle on Monday Night Football. Villa, meanwhile, remain rooted to the foot of the table, nine points from safety with just eight games remaining. Spurs flew out of the traps and looked like scoring every time they went forward in the opening 10 minutes with Kane passing up the best of the opportunities. Harry Kane gives his reaction after scoring twice for Tottenham at Villa Park Harry Kane gives his reaction after scoring twice for Tottenham at Villa Park Erik Lamela played him in with a perfectly weighted through-ball but the England international lofted his effort over the advancing Brad Guzan and against the bar. Villa had a chance of their own soon after as Jordan Veretout stole in behind the Spurs defence and pulled the ball back to Rudy Gestede. The striker was unable to make the required contact with his volley though, and Spurs were able to clear. Carles Gil of Villa battles with Tottenham's Danny Rose That sparked a good spell of pressure for Villa but they failed to capitalise and the next clear chance fell to Tottenham as a flowing move ended with Kane shooting tamely at Guzan from eight yards from Danny Rose's low cross. Guzan was called into action again to deny Kane soon after but his best moment of a busy first half came when he pushed Lamela's close range attempt onto the post before Alan Hutton hacked the ball off the line as it rebounded off the goalkeeper's back and rolled towards goal. Gestede volleyed straight at Hugo Lloris from Carles Gil's free-kick as the game approached half-time but just as Villa thought they might reach the interval on level terms, Kane struck. Mauricio Pochettino gives his post-match thoughts after Spurs beat Aston Villa Mauricio Pochettino gives his post-match thoughts after Spurs beat Aston Villa Dele Alli showed fine awareness to jump up having been bundled over to lift a quick free-kick over the Villa defence and into the path of Kane. The England front man kept his cool and held off Hutton to slot his left-footer into the far corner. Within three minutes of the restart, Kane scored his and Tottenham's second, running onto Alli's pass from the left to stab the ball home from 10 yards. That effectively killed the game as a contest and both teams seemed to accept the result with goalmouth action at a minimum until the final 15 minutes. Kane fired in his first goal just before half-time Lamela should have made it three having burst into the box but saw his shot deflected wide before Villa hit the woodwork three times in the closing stages. First, Jordan Ayew hit the ball against the near post from a tight angle having beaten Mousa Dembele down the left before Gestede thumped the rebound against the crossbar from inside the six yard box. It was a moment that summed up Villa's season and it was compounded a couple of minutes later as Gestede flicked on a corner to the far post where Joleon Lescott was arriving unmarked.

City have a ruthless record against teams in the bottom half this season but despite bossing possession they rarely troubled a dogged and determined Norwich, who hit the crossbar through Patrick Bamford in the first half. The result leaves Manuel Pellegrini's side nine points behind league leaders Leicester City, who play Newcastle on Monday Night Football, while Norwich move level on points with Sunderland in 17th but remain in the relegation zone. Manuel Pellegrini blamed Man City's inability to create space for the 0-0 draw Manuel Pellegrini blamed Man City's inability to create space for the 0-0 draw Norwich made four changes from the side that lost 1-0 at Swansea, while City made just one, with Fernando replacing the injured Yaya Toure. The visitors dominated the opening stages, and had two chances to open the scoring through top scorer Sergio Aguero. Joe Hart was disappointed with Manchester City's draw against Norwich Joe Hart was disappointed with Manchester City's draw against Norwich First, his 30-yard free-kick was tipped over the bar by John Ruddy, before the Norwich stopper was at his best to get down low to his right to tip wide the Argentine's fierce low effort. But it was Norwich who had the best chance of the first half through Bamford, whose 30-yard half-volley bounced off the top of the crossbar having beaten Joe Hart. Sergio Aguero goes for goal from a free-kick City replaced the ineffectual Wilfried Bony with Raheem Sterling just after the break but struggled to really impose themselves on the game. Aguero won a free-kick on the edge of the box on 64 minutes, but David Silva's effort was blocked away the wall. City started to pin Norwich back deep inside their own half and although they worked the ball into good areas down both flanks, Jesus Navas and Sterling failed to find the killer final ball.

Bournemouth all but guaranteed their Premier League status for next season with an entertaining 3-2 win over Swansea at the Vitality Stadium on Saturday. Max Gradel gave the hosts a 37th-minute lead, only for Mo Barrow to equalise for Swansea within two minutes and ensure the sides were tied together at 1-1 at the break. Bournemouth were in front again five minutes into the second half though, Josh King powering the ball past Lukasz Fabianski. Swansea hit back through Gylfi Sigurdsson (62) but the Cherries were not to be denied as Steve Cook rose highest to head home what proved to be the winner with 12 minutes remaining. Eddie Howe's side are now 13 points clear of the drop zone, while Swansea are closer to the danger zone but have an eight-point cushion above the relegation places. Josh King (left) was a constant threat to the Swansea backline It was a quick start to the game and both sides came close within five minutes of the kick-off. First, King headed Gradel's left wing cross onto the roof of the net for Bournemouth before, at the other end, Wayne Routledge sent a dipping volley narrowly over the crossbar. Bournemouth gradually began to gain the upper hand with King, a constant threat to the Swansea backline, firing a left-foot effort over the bar from inside the box and Andrew Surman curling a free-kick round the wall and against the post. Bournemouth defender Steve Cook says he's delighted with the 3-2 win Bournemouth defender Steve Cook says he's delighted with the 3-2 win For Swansea, Barrow always looked the most likely to make something happen and the winger felt he should have had a penalty after going over under the challenge of Charlie Daniels. The referee waved away his protests despite replays showing there was contact. The Swans' frustration was added to when Gradel broke the deadlock, calmly firing the ball into the far corner after Fabianski pushed Adam Smith's cross into his path, via a deflection off Federico Fernandez. King celebrates after scoring Bournemouth's second goal The lead lasted just two minutes though as Barrow scored a fine individual goal to equalise. Having picked up the ball on the right wing, he drove to the edge of the box, threw in a couple of stepovers before cutting inside and curling the ball beyond Artur Boruc's despairing dive and into the far corner. That was how it remained until the break but within five minutes of the restart Bournemouth retook the lead. Eddie Howe praised Max Gradel and Josh King after the victory Eddie Howe praised Max Gradel and Josh King after the victory King won possession inside the Swansea half and found Gradel who advanced to the edge of penalty area before playing the return pass. King then took a touch before smashing the ball past Fabianski at his near post. Despite the ferocity of the strike, the goalkeeper may feel he could have done better. Again Swansea refused to lie down though and levelled for the second time just after the hour mark. Barrow got to the byline and cut the ball back for Sigurdsson. The Icelandic midfielder took a touch before arrowing the ball into the corner of the net for his seventh goal in 11 games. Alan Curtis believes Swansea 'gifted' Bournemouth goals Alan Curtis believes Swansea 'gifted' Bournemouth goals At that point, Swansea looked the most likely winners, Alberto Paloschi forcing a smart save from Boruc with his shot on the spin. However, it was Bournemouth who grabbed the game's fifth goal as Matt Ritchie swung in an inviting cross following a short corner, Cook rising highest to power a header into the far corner. The goal seemed to sap all the energy out of Swansea and Bournemouth were able to see out the game with relative ease. Matt Le Tissier's Soccer Saturday verdict Matt Le Tissier gives his thoughts on Bournemouth's 3-2 win against Swansea Matt Le Tissier gives his thoughts on Bournemouth's 3-2 win against Swansea \"It was very open, very attacking - both sides were going for it from the off. The only surprise was that it took 37 minutes for the first goal to come. \"Should Swansea be worried? From what I saw, they've got more than enough in the squad to pick up enough points between now and the end of the season. They won't need too many more in my opinion. \"It was a good collective performance from Bournemouth but the one who caught my eye was Adam Smith at right-back, especially first half - a bundle of energy going on overlaps.\" Player ratings Bournemouth: Boruc (6), Smith (7), Francis (6), Cook (7), Daniels (5), Ritchie (7), Gosling (5), Surman (7), Gradel (8), King (8), Afobe (6).

Saints substitute Sadio Mane saw red in stoppage time after clashing with Erik Pieters, but the visitors held on to secure their first win since mid-February. The win sends Southampton above Stoke into seventh and keeps alive their hopes of European qualification with Liverpool to come at St Mary's next Sunday, while the hosts drop to ninth. Stoke were boosted by the return of Ryan Shawcross, who made his first appearance since January, while Ronald Koeman made two changes from the 1-1 draw against Sunderland as Shane Long and Matt Targett came into the side. Pelle grabbed the first goal of the game from a corner In front of a record crowd at the Britannia, the visitors started on the front foot and Butland was called into action early, tipping over Pelle's flicked header. From the resulting corner the Southampton striker, who had not scored for 13 matches, escaped the attention of Philipp Wollscheid and found the net at the near post.

The visitors nearly doubled their lead immediately, but Butland parried Long's shot clear after the forward latched onto Cuco Martina's through ball. The away side did make it two after 30 minutes, as Dusan Tadic and Pelle combined before the Italian received the return pass and curled past Butland. Pelle scored his first goal since November at the Britannia A difficult first half got worse for Stoke when Xherdan Shaqiri was forced off through injury, and the Potters struggled to get their creative players involved. They enjoyed more than 60 per cent possession in the first half but were continually hit on the counter, and should have gone in at half-time three goals behind as Tadic squandered a glorious opportunity. Pelle struck twice in the opening half-hour Long got behind the Potters defence again and squared for the Serb, but the Saints attacker took too long with the goal gaping, allowing Geoff Cameron to scramble back and clear. It looked like the miss may prove costly when Arnautovic grabbed his 11th goal of the season seven minutes after the break. Southampton striker Graziano Pelle says he is relieved to have ended his goalless run Southampton striker Graziano Pelle says he is relieved to have ended his goalless run The Stoke forward fired past Forster from Ibrahim Afellay's low cross, and the goal gave Stoke a lift as they swiftly went in search of the equaliser. Arnautovic drew a save from Forster with a firm drive, before last-ditch defending from the impressive Virgil van Dijk denied Mame Diram Diouf with the striker poised to pull the trigger. Geoff Cameron and Tadic compete for the ball in the first half Referee Lee Mason turned down a Southampton penalty appeal after Tadic went down under the challenge from Butland, and Mark Hughes brought on Peter Crouch as Stoke chased a leveller, but his introduction saw the home side go more direct. That suited the Saints as they repelled the Potters attack, and Ward-Prowse struck the woodwork with a fine free-kick with three minutes to play.

penalty as 10-man Liverpool came from behind to claim a dramatic 2-1 win over Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park. Joe Ledley scored his first goal in 33 appearances to give Alan Pardew's side the lead in the 48th minute and Palace's chances of ending an 11-game run without a win were strengthened when James Milner was sent off for two bookable offences just after the hour mark. Should Liverpool's injury-time penalty against Crystal Palace have been awarded? Jamie Carragher and Thierry Henry debated the decision Should Liverpool's injury-time penalty against Crystal Palace have been awarded? Jamie Carragher and Thierry Henry debated the decision However, Liverpool were handed a lifeline after Alex McCarthy's clearance fell straight to Roberto Firmino and the Brazilian made no mistake, slotting the ball into the back of the net (72). The comeback was complete deep into injury-time when substitute Benteke went down under a challenge from Damien Delaney despite minimal contact. Referee Andre Marriner pointed to the spot, after consulting with his assistant, allowing the Belgium international to send McCarthy the wrong way with one of the last kicks of the game (90+6) and seal a dramatic win. Delaney's challenge on Benteke was the hot topic post-match Victory sees Liverpool move up to seventh, six points off the Champions League places, while Palace's worrying form continues as their wait for a first league win of 2016 goes on. Palace, who made four changes from the side that drew 2-2 with Sunderland in midweek, were dealt a blow when in-form striker Connor Wickham was ruled out through injury, but his replacement Emmanuel Adebayor looked lively in the early stages. Christian Benteke felt the referee was correct in awarding the late penalty at Selhurst Park Christian Benteke felt the referee was correct in awarding the late penalty at Selhurst Park In the seventh minute, the former Tottenham striker broke into the Liverpool box before pulling the ball back for Yannick Bolasie, but Mignolet was quickly off his line to save at the feet of the winger. Four minutes later, Palace had another glorious opportunity to take the lead as Adebayor rose highest to meet Pape Souare's cross, but his header came back off the crossbar. Jurgen Klopp says Liverpool fully deserved their win after fighting back from a goal down Jurgen Klopp says Liverpool fully deserved their win after fighting back from a goal down Liverpool, who recalled Alberto Moreno and Mamadou Sakho into the starting line-up, were enjoying plenty of possession but it was Palace looking the more likely to find an opening as Wilfried Zaha played in Yohan Cabaye, the France international taking on an early shot which curled into the side-netting. Jurgen Klopp's side responded as Divock Origi curled over from the edge of the box before Milner, who was booked for a rash challenge on Cabaye, had a free-kick deflected over the bar, but the half came to a close with the visitors failing to register a shot on target. Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew disputed the last-minute penalty awarded to Liverpool Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew disputed the last-minute penalty awarded to Liverpool It was Palace who made the perfect start after the break with Ledley finding the bottom corner for his first goal since November 2014 after Firmino's sliced clearance. Liverpool's James Milner fouls Crystal Palace's Wilfried Zaha before being sent-off And Liverpool's task was made even harder in the 62nd minute when Milner received his marching orders for a second yellow card after a foul on Zaha. But they were gifted a way back into the game 10 minutes later when McCarthy slipped attempting a routine clearance from a pass back. The ball went straight to Firmino and the 24-year-old picked his spot to score his seventh league goal since the turn of the year. Despite being down to 10 men, it was Liverpool who pressed forward for a winner and they went close through Moreno, but his powerful drive hit the post late on. The dramatic breakthrough came in the last minute of the game as Benteke went to ground after an attempted challenge from Delaney. Marriner did not award anything initially but after consulting with his assistant pointed to the spot, and Benteke calmly rolled the ball past McCarthy to secure Liverpool's win.

Louis van Gaal felt a more experienced referee may not have sent off Manchester United's Juan Mata Louis van Gaal felt a more experienced referee may not have sent off Manchester United's Juan Mata United held out until the 66th minute but their resistance was eventually broken when Salomon Rondon fired home. The defeat sees United remain three points behind fourth-placed Manchester City in the Premier League having also played a game more, while West Brom move up to 11th. Four victories in a row in all competitions had raised United's spirits but Louis van Gaal still made four changes from the side that won against Watford in midweek, with Chris Smalling and Michael Carrick among the players to return to the starting XI. On Super Sunday, Thierry Henry praised Salomon Rondon's match-winning performance On Super Sunday, Thierry Henry praised Salomon Rondon's match-winning performance United saw plenty of the ball in the early stages but it was West Brom who looked the more threatening side. Craig Dawson headed wide after climbing above Anthony Martial and Chris Smalling blocked a shot from Saido Berahino. Mike Dean sends Manchester United's Juan Mata off The visitors struggled to create many chances of note at the other end and they suffered a setback midway through the half as Mata was dismissed. The Spaniard was firstly booked for stopping West Brom taking a quick free-kick by sticking his leg up and then shown a second yellow minutes later for tripping Fletcher and with the man advantage, the Baggies stepped up the pressure. Dawson went close with a ambitious long-range half volley that flew just wide of the post with David de Gea scrambling back before Stephane Sessegnon shot at the keeper. United managed to regain their composure as the half wore on and then started brightly after the break. Tony Pulis felt Salomon Rondon produced a match-winning performance for West Brom Tony Pulis felt Salomon Rondon produced a match-winning performance for West Brom Marcus Rashford saw a shot deflected narrowly wide after good work from Martial and Jesse Lingard then shot onto the roof of the net after cutting in from the left. But United, perhaps feeling the effects of being a man down,, could not maintain their pressure and fell behind in the 66th minute. Substitute Sebastien Pocognoli put in a good cross from the left that Rondon controlled and then fired past De Gea. The introduction of Memphis Depay in place of Rashford failed to jump-start the visitors and West Brom's lead was rarely threatened as United struggled to create any chances in the closing stages, a stony-faced Sir Alex Ferguson pictured in the stands at the final whistle.

The Chilean struck with 14 minutes to play after goals from Toby Alderweireld (60) and Harry Kane (62) had overturned Aaron Ramsey's (39) first-half opener. Spurs appeared to be heading for three points when they scored two in quick succession shortly after Francis Coquelin had been sent off for a second yellow card on 55 minutes. Harry Kane celebrates his goal in the second half But Sanchez's strike earned a share of the spoils and Ramsey nearly grabbed the winner for the Gunners, only for Kevin Wimmer's last-ditch challenge to deny the Arsenal midfielder. The draw opened the door for Leicester to extend their lead at the top and they beat Watford on Saturday Night Football, with Tottenham now five points behind the Foxes and Arsenal a further three back. Arsene Wenger handed Mohamed Elneny his full Premier League debut as both managers made four changes from their midweek defeats, but it was Tottenham who started the brighter. Mauricio Pochettino described Arsene Wenger as Kane drew an early save from David Ospina, in for the injured Petr Cech, while Dele Alli and Erik Lamela both threatened to get behind the Arsenal defence. The Gunners rarely looked dangerous in attack early on and nearly fell behind on 25 minutes when Kyle Walker's driven cross was turned goalwards by Lamela, but Ospina reacted brilliantly to keep it out. Tottenham conceded a late goal to Arsenal to draw 2-2 in the North London derby Tottenham conceded a late goal to Arsenal to draw 2-2 in the North London derby The first-half became scrappy as the interval neared, and the visitors stunned the home crowd as Ramsey's back-heel finish put them ahead with their first shot on target. Danny Welbeck broke clear down the left and crossed for Hector Bellerin, who teed up Ramsey to guide past Lloris. Aaron Ramsey celebrates after edging Arsenal in front before half-time The goal gave the Gunners a lift and they threatened to double their lead before the break. Alexis Sanchez's cut-back went untouched before Lloris held Welbeck's diving header, and they looked comfortable until Coquelin's red card on 55 minutes. The midfielder was booked for handball in the first half, and picked up his second yellow from referee Michael Oliver for a lunge on Kane. Mousa Dembele tussles with Danny Welbeck in the first-half at White Hart Lane The man advantage sparked Spurs into life, and they equalised through Alderweireld five minutes later. It was a carbon copy of a chance moments before for Kane, but while Ospina brilliantly denied the Spurs striker then, he could do little to prevent Alderweireld from blasting home from close range. Kane capped a remarkable turnaround with Tottenham's second two minutes later, curling a stunning strike in off the post for his 14th goal in 18 Premier League London derbies. Harry Kane had been denied by David Ospina moments before his goal And the hosts looked comfortable before Sanchez equalised out of nothing. The forward, who had not scored in the league since October, latched onto Bellerin's pass and calmly slotted past Lloris. Eric Dier was fortunate to avoid a second yellow card for a pull on substitute Oliver Giroud's shirt as Spurs pushed for a winner, and Alli drew a smart stop from Ospina with a long-distance effort. Arsenal retained a threat and Lloris was called into action to punch clear Sanchez's dipping free-kick, before Gabriel was fortunate to avoid a spectacular own goal when his skewed clearance landed on the roof of the net.

celebrates with his team-mates after equalising for Stoke Mame Biram Diouf's 85th minute header earned Stoke a deserved 1-1 draw at Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Saturday. Despite Diouf missing two clear chances for Stoke early on, Chelsea took the lead through Bertrand Traore's superb left-footed strike from 25 yards. Xherdan Shaqiri forced a fine save out of Thibaut Courtois in the second half, and got their equaliser through Diouf's header with five minutes remaining, just as Stoke were preparing to substitute the striker. Ibrahim Afellay in action for Stoke in the first half The result leaves Chelsea in tenth, 10 points off the top four spots, while Stoke are seventh, three points ahead of the Blues. Diego Costa and Pedro were left out of the squad for Chelsea in view of the Champions League last-16 second leg against PSG on Wednesday, while Cesc Fabregas started on the bench. Chelsea's Bertrand Traore scored in their 1-1 draw with Stoke but said the result feels like a defeat Chelsea's Bertrand Traore scored in their 1-1 draw with Stoke but said the result feels like a defeat The hosts' lack of creativity and attacking threat showed in the opening stages as the best two chances fell to Stoke. Diouf fed Ibrahim Afellay on the left wing from halfway, and having continued his run, got on the end of the Dutchman's superb cross, but could only poke the ball over Courtois' crossbar. Bertrand Traore celebrates scoring Chelsea's first at Stamford Bridge Diouf again had an opportunity to give Stoke the lead two minutes before Chelsea themselves scored, but he volleyed into the ground and wide from 12 yards after Shaqiri's chipped cross to the far post. Chelsea went into the half ahead through 20-year-old Traore, who received the ball from Nemanja Matic with his back to goal 25 yards out, before turning and unleashing a superb shot into the left corner for his fourth goal in five games. Courtois got down well to tip away Shaqiri's left-footed drive from 15 yards just before the half-hour mark as Stoke had the better of the chances in the second half again. Chelsea felt they should have had a penalty when Oscar went down under a tackle from behind by Marc Muniesa, but referee Mark Clattenburg waved play on. Stoke boss Mark Hughes felt his side did enough to take all three points at Stamford Bridge Stoke boss Mark Hughes felt his side did enough to take all three points at Stamford Bridge Substitute Ruben Loftus-Cheek forced a decent save out of Jack Butland at the other end from an acute angle, but Stoke got a deserved equaliser four minutes later. Shaqiri's cross from the right towards Marko Arnautovic was punched away unconvincingly by Courtois, and as the ball fell to Diouf, who was due to be substituted by manager Mark Hughes, the striker composed himself to loop his header into the empty net for 1-1. Stoke had the chance to win it in injury time after Giannelli Imbula powered past two Chelsea players to get to the byline and centre for Bojan, who carried the ball across the face of the area before attempting to find the bottom left corner, but Courtois was equal to his effort.

to beat 10-man Everton 3-2 in a thrilling game at Goodison Park. Everton had burst into a two-goal lead when Romelu Lukaku and Aaron Lennon scored either side of what was to prove a costly red card to Kevin Mirallas. It looked as though the home side would cope with that setback and they should have ended the match as a contest with a penalty 20 minutes from time, but Lukaku saw his effort saved by Adrian. Instead, West Ham took that as their cue for recovery and headed goals from Michail Antonio and substitute Diafra Sakho saw parity restored before Payet converted from close range for all three points. Romelu Lukaku of Everton celebrates scoring his team's first goal The win is West Ham's third in a row and means they go above Manchester United and into fifth in the Premier League table, eight points behind leaders Leicester City. Everton, meanwhile, remain 11th but have now only won one of their past four home matches and their extension of that sequence will be of deep concern to manager Roberto Martinez. West Ham boss Slaven Bilic hailed his side's brilliant win. West Ham boss Slaven Bilic hailed his side's brilliant win. The loss of Mirallas was a major factor; having already received a disputable booking for diving he made the poor decision to challenge Aaron Cresswell on the slide and was inevitably dismissed. Dimitri Payet tries to get away from James McCarthy But his loss did not seem to hurt Everton, who were already in front after Lukaku had turned Reece Oxford on the edge of the box and planted a left-footed shot past Adrian and extended that advantage when the Belgian played a one-two with Lennon, who tucked his shot coolly under the goalkeeper. Lukaku was given the opportunity to make it 3-0 when substitute Muhamed Besic wriggled into space on the edge of the box and went down under a challenge from Alex Song, which referee Anthony Taylor deemed to be inside the line. Adrian saved it and 10 minutes later Antonio had the ball in the net, powerfully heading in Mark Noble's left-wing cross. Dimitri Payet of West Ham United scores the winner It revitalised West Ham and was a major blow for an Everton side who had competed well for 44 minutes with a man fewer than their opponents. Their fatigue was exposed two minutes later when Sakho provided a similarly firm header for the equaliser, this time putting away a Payet cross from the opposite wing. Everton's Phil Jagielka says everything went downhill after they missed a penalty. Everton's Phil Jagielka says everything went downhill after they missed a penalty. Payet had been quiet throughout Everton's periods of dominance but laid on that vital ball and then showed his predatory instincts to mop up the winner. West Ham have made a name for themselves as purveyors of passing football this season but their winning goal was pure route one - a direct ball headed on by Andy Carroll and flicked into the path of Payet by Sakho. You get the impression, however, that they won't mind. Everton boss Roberto Martinez says defeat to West Ham was tough to take.

Villa on Saturday. Manuel Pellegrini's side have slipped off the pace in the title race but goals from Yaya Toure, Raheem Sterling and a double from Sergio Aguero moved them to within 10 points of league leaders Leicester City. Aguero could also afford to spurn a penalty as he missed out on a hat-trick against a Villa side that mustered just two shots on goal and had 28 per cent possession. The result means Villa plunge closer to relegation from the Premier League with Remi Garde's side now nine points from safety. Gael Clichy says Manchester City are not taking notice of who is dropping points around them but only on winning games themselves Gael Clichy says Manchester City are not taking notice of who is dropping points around them but only on winning games themselves Wilfried Bony was handed his first start of 2016 as he partnered Aguero in attack as Pellegrini made three changes to his team that limped to a 3-0 defeat at Liverpool on Wednesday. The pattern of the game was clear from the outset. Manchester City attacked, Aston Villa sat back. Manuel Pellegrini says patience was key for Manchester City following their 4-0 win over Aston Villa at the Etihad Manuel Pellegrini says patience was key for Manchester City following their 4-0 win over Aston Villa at the Etihad Garde's team had 11 men behind the ball for large parts as City enjoyed 77 per cent possession in the first half, although they rarely looked capable of breaking through Villa's deep backline.

Remi Garde says his Aston Villa side are 'fragile' following their 4-0 Premier League loss to Manchester City Remi Garde says his Aston Villa side are 'fragile' following their 4-0 Premier League loss to Manchester City Villa mustered their first shot on goal on 26 minutes but it so nearly gave them an unlikely lead as Joe Hart had to be very alert to palm away a snappy Jordan Ayew effort. The home fans were becoming a little frustrated with their side but any fears of a further Premier League slip-up were put to bed within three minutes of the restart. Jesus Navas gets away from Jordan Veretout Toure finished off a move instigated by Aguero with a cool finish that deflected past Guzan off Micah Richards. The returning Richards, who played 179 games for City, was in the thick of the action again two minutes later as Aguero punished his mistake to make it 2-0. A ball in behind the centre-back put him in all sorts of trouble and his sliding clearance came off Aguero and straight into the net. Aguero scores his team's second goal The Argentine striker sensed blood and trebled City's lead on 60 minutes as Villa's defending descended into a farce. Aguero sprung into life and played a fantastic one-two with Silva. With Richards standing and watching, Aguero raced past him and smashed the ball into the bottom corner. Sterling replaced Bony on 62 minutes and took just four minutes to get on the scoresheet. Raheem Sterling celebrates scoring his team's fourth goal with David Silva Jesus Navas raced away down the right and squared the ball across the box for Sterling to tap home from close range. The Villa defence just stood and watched. Ciaran Clark fouled substitute Kelechi Iheanacho in the penalty area on 72 minutes but Aguero missed his chance for a treble by curling the effort from 12 yards against the post. Matt Le Tissier analyses City's resounding win Matt Le Tissier analyses City's resounding win Soccer Saturday verdict - Matt Le Tissier \"There was a vast gulf between the two sides. Villa threatened once in the first half, had one shot, when they actually threw enough men forward to make a difference.

on Newcastle and Steve McClaren with a 3-1 win at St James' Park on Saturday. Newcastle's players once again failed to deliver on the pitch and were booed off by their own fans after a disappointing display. They fell behind in unfortunate style after 28 minutes as Josh King's cross was turned into his own net by Steven Taylor. King doubled the advantage in the 70th minute before Ayoze Perez replied to give Newcastle hope, but Charlie Daniels made sure of victory with a third goal for the visitors in injury-time. While the win moves Bournemouth 11 points clear of the relegation zone, Newcastle remain rooted in the bottom three and the pressure increases on their manager, who had to endure chants questioning his future from disgruntled fans. McClaren opted to hand Emmanuel Riviere his first start of the season in place of Aleksandar Mitrovic while Perez came in for Yoan Gouffran. Jack Colback of Newcastle United reacts to Bournemouth's third goal The hosts made a positive start as Moussa Sissoko crossed just over Riviere's head and Jonjo Shelvey dragged a shot wide. But Bournemouth also created chances as Max Gradel's effort deflected past the post and Benik Afobe fired over the bar from 12 yards out. Simon Francis then blocked a first-time shot from Riviere as neither side was able to assert any control in the early stages. Bournemouth got the breakthrough after 28 minutes, though, as Taylor slid to block a cross from King and ended up diverting it into his own net. Georginio Wijnaldum tries to find space McClaren's response was to bring on Vurnon Anita for Paul Dummett but it took the hosts until late in the half to fashion a chance as Taylor's shot was deflected just wide. Riviere was replaced by Aleksandar Mitrovic at the break, but it was the visitors who nearly increased their lead as Adam Smith forced Rob Elliot into a save. Steve McClaren says the negative chanting from the Newcastle fans was justified. Steve McClaren says the negative chanting from the Newcastle fans was justified. The Cherries continued to set the pace although Mitrovic did go close with a curling shot in the 61st minute and Artur Boruc saved from Daryl Janmaat. But the visitors doubled their advantage with 20 minutes remaining when King turned in the box and lashed a shot past Elliot. Perez gave the home side hope when he reduced the deficit with nine minutes remaining, but Daniels made sure of the result by firing home in injury-time.

You're talking about a team, Bournemouth, who have just come up, nowhere near the stature of club Newcastle are, and you'd have thought it was the other way around. It was a phenomenal performance by Bournemouth. \"It must be hard to play at Newcastle. After 10 minutes the crowd were on their backs. They were booing. I haven't heard booing like this. They made a sub after 15 mins, the crowd were booing. He was injured. You don't take him off and put Colback at left back - McClaren isn't that silly - but the crowd go mad. Then Sissoko comes off and they go mad again. He's up against it. It reminds me of Sam Allardyce at West Ham. The crowd, whatever you do, it doesn't make any difference. \"When you're losing every week it isn't nice. But these players are Premier League players. They play in the Premier League and get Premier League wages. So step in and play Premier League football and be like a Premier League player and defend like a Premier League player.

The visitors had appeared on course for a crucial three points in their bid to avoid relegation after substitute Jermain Defoe opened the scoring five minutes from time. However, the Saints - who were reduced to 10 men when captain Jose Fonte was sent off after 79 minutes - drew level through Van Dijk with virtually the last kick of the match. The point does, though, see Sunderland move a point clear of both Norwich City and Newcastle in the relegation zone, while Southampton move up to eighth in the table. Ronald Koeman opted to shake things up after Southampton had lost their last two Premier League encounters, with the Dutchman making five changes from their midweek loss at Bournemouth. The home team were without injured strikers Charlie Austin (hamstring) and Shane Long (knee), with Graziano Pelle recalled to lead the line as the frontman looked to end a goal drought stretching back 12 games to November. Sam Allardyce says he and his Sunderland side were left 'totally dejected' Sam Allardyce says he and his Sunderland side were left 'totally dejected' Sam Allardyce, meanwhile, was without captain John O'Shea, with the influential centre-back only fit enough to take his place on the substitutes' bench after failing to recover completely from the calf problem he sustained against Crystal Palace on Tuesday. However, Allardyce also sprung a surprise by leaving Defoe on the bench as Fabio Borini - who scored the Black Cats' vital late equaliser against Palace - coming in to start up front in his place. The Sunderland boss had targeted five wins from the final 10 league fixtures of the season for his team to stay up, and judging by the Saints' lacklustre start to proceedings on the south coast, he would have been earmaking this match as one of those. The visitors enjoyed plenty of possession in the early stages, without ever testing Fraser Forster in Southampton's goal, as recent new signing Jan Kirchhoff took control of the midfield battle. Southampton boss Ronald Koeman believes his side played better football after having a man sent off Southampton boss Ronald Koeman believes his side played better football after having a man sent off But it was Southampton who created the first real chance of the game after 26 minutes when a lovely cushioned header back by Pelle set up Dusan Tadic for a shot on goal, only for Vito Mannone to deny the Serb with a brilliant reaction save. Sunderland also went close before the break as first winger Wahbi Khazri almost caught Forster out with an inswinging free-kick from the left-hand touchline that forced the goalkeeper to turn the ball on to his own bar. Jack Rodwell should have scored as well after a penetrative run down the left by Patrick van Aanholt, however, the midfielder miscued badly from 10 yards after being picked out perfectly by the Dutchman. Meanwhile, the Saints had strong appeals for a penalty waved away by referee Neil Swarbrick just before the break after a handball by DeAndre Yedlin. In the second period, though, it was the visitors who started to look the more dangerous of the two teams. Jermain Defoe says the Sunderland squad were disappointed to concede a late equaliser Jermain Defoe says the Sunderland squad were disappointed to concede a late equaliser Sunderland, who brought on Defoe just before the hour-mark, almost broke the deadlock when Borini's well-struck volley from outside the area beat Forster, but flew just over the bar. And the turning point of the contest appeared to be the sending-off of Fonte 11 minutes from time after the centre-back pulled back Borini on the edge of the box as the Italian broke through on goal. In fact, it took Sunderland only six minutes to take advantage of their numerical superiority as Defoe toe-poked home Lamine Kone's inviting ball across the six-yard line after Southampton failed to clear their lines. However, with just a third Premier League away win this season within their grasp, Sunderland conceded in the last minute of stoppage time after Tadic broke clear down the left. The wide man picked out Van Dijk 12 yards out with an inch-perfect centre, and the Dutchman swept home the equaliser past a helpless Mannone. Soccer Saturday verdict - Charlie Nicholas Charlie Nicholas reflects on the game Charlie Nicholas reflects on the game \"It will feel like a defeat for Sunderland. When Southampton go down to 10 men and Defoe's nicked it coming off the bench with only five minutes to go plus added time, you really do think 'wrap it up'. It was a killer blow. Sam was looking at his watch, trying to push his team up and you thought he was going to get the win and the clean sheet he was craving. \"To be fair to Southampton, down to 10 men, they came back and got a draw and it's a decent point for them. It was a bright performance from Sunderland, full of energy. They looked a really well-drilled side. Defensively they were good. There are a lot of good things for them.

Swansea thought they should have had a penalty just before the break when Andre Ayew was brought down by Timm Klose on the edge of the penalty area. The Ghanaian forward led the Swansea appeals but referee Craig Pawson was unmoved. Alberto Paloschi was withdrawn at half-time, with Curtis moving Ayew up front and Modou Barrow introduced on the right wing. The move worked for the hosts as they started to dominate possession, but they could not make it count with Barrow and Ayew both firing over the bar. Wes Hoolahan is challenged by Ashley Williams However, they eventually found the finishing touch in the 61st minute as Jack Cork released substitute Leroy Fer, whose pass picked out Sigurdsson and the Iceland international made no mistake with a low finish into the bottom corner from 14 yards. The influential Wayne Routledge almost added a second goal in the 67th minute only for Ruddy to deny him at his near post and the Norwich goalkeeper was in action again late on, pushing Sigurdsson's free-kick away from goal. Norwich pushed for an equaliser right until the end and almost claimed a point when Routledge's poor clearance fell to Redmond, but the winger's shot drifted wide of the far post. Gylfi Sigurdsson (left) and Jack Cork (right) celebrate Swansea's winning goal The visitors had one final chance as substitute Patrick Bamford poked a shot towards goal but Fabianski held on to the ball as Swansea edged closer to safety. Soccer Saturday verdict - Phil Thompson Phil Thompson looks back on the game. Phil Thompson looks back on the game. \"If Swansea can get five more points they should be safe. The game hinged on Britton off, Fer on. He supplies the ball to Sigurdsson, across the box, and he puts it in the far corner on 61 minutes. Sigurdsson was by far the best player in the game. \"Norwich showed very little in the second half. They had a real go but why didn't they show that urgency earlier on? I don't think Norwich will have enough. They don't score enough goals and Jerome never really worries you. They stay in games for quite a while but it always seems to be them who buckle. Chances were few and far between but Swansea will be delighted with their return in the last few days.\" Player ratings Norwich boss Alex Neil was disappointed with 'another missed opportunity'.

Saturday's north London derby draw opened the door for Claudio Ranieri's side to take a potentially crucial step towards the title, and they took full advantage as Mahrez's 56th-minute strike saw off Watford. The victory marks a remarkable turnaround for Leicester who, at the same stage last season, were seven points from safety rooted firmly to the bottom of the league. Jamie Redknapp and Alan Smith discuss whether there is a better player in the Premier League this season than Leicester's Riyad Mahrez Jamie Redknapp and Alan Smith discuss whether there is a better player in the Premier League this season than Leicester's Riyad Mahrez Fast forward 12 months and victory at Vicarage Road moves the Foxes five points clear at the summit and clear favourites for the title. For Watford, defeat - their 12th of the Premier League season - leaves them 12th in the table. N'Golo Kante was recalled into the Leicester team having shaken off the hamstring strain that ruled him out of their midweek draw against West Brom. Mahrez puts Leicester in front Quique Sanchez Flores made three changes following Watford's defeat at Old Trafford, with Mario Suarez, Nordin Amrabat and Nathan Ake starting. Having initially been named on the bench, Jose Holebas replaced Miguel Britos after the centre-back picked up an injury in the warm-up, and the last-minute alteration appeared to unsettle the hosts as Leicester threatened early on.

Gomes was called into action a minute later to deny Christian Fuchs' low drive after the left-back had capitalised on some slack defending. Troy Deeney and Danny Drinkwater tussle Ake then saw a header clip the top of the bar on 11 minutes as Watford appeared to have weathered the early Leicester storm. Vardy had other ideas though, sending a lob over Gomes narrowly wide shortly after before failing to convert Mahrez's low centre on 23 minutes as the best chance of the game went a begging. Claudio Ranieri insists Leicester must regard each of their remaining nine games as a final Claudio Ranieri insists Leicester must regard each of their remaining nine games as a final The Foxes were almost made to pay for their profligacy when the ball dropped for Hornets captain Troy Deeney on 27 minutes, but his effort nestled in the arms of Kasper Schmeichel. The first half petered out, as too did the opening exchanges of the second, until Mahrez finally broke Watford's resolve. Jamie Vardy and Nathan Ake compete for the ball The Algerian, who had been anonymous until that point, sparked himself and the game into life, thrashing the ball high past Gomes at his near post for his 15th goal in a stellar season. Brimming with confidence, Leicester went close to doubling their lead as Huth twice saw headers miss the target. There was a slight blot on their copy book, though, as Mahrez went down injured clutching his leg, with Ranieri replacing him shortly after. Odion Ighalo fluffed a late chance, heading straight at Schmeichel after Deeney's flick, as Watford failed to score for the seventh time in their last nine Premier League games.

The Gunners had taken the lead through Joel Campbell in the 15th minute, but Wayne Routledge then levelled just after the half-hour mark for the Swans. Arsenal hit the woodwork three times, and missed a host of other chances, but it was Swansea, without head coach Francesco Guidolin who missed the game through illness, who found the winner as Ashley Williams bundled home from Gylfi Sigurdsson's free-kick with just over 15 minutes to go. The result leaves Arsene Wenger's men six points behind leaders Leicester, piling the pressure on the Frenchman's shoulders in the process, while Swansea climb six points away from the relegation zone. Petr Cech cannot stop the Swansea skipper scoring The hosts dominated right from the off, and it wasn't long before Campbell gave them the lead, lashing the ball home on the half-volley from Alexis Sanchez's dinked pass, and they should have been out of sight by half-time. Before providing the opener, Sanchez himself hit the post, and Olivier Giroud smashed the ball against the bar from Per Mertesacker's knockdown just before the break. But all Arsenal's good work came undone in the 32nd minute as Swansea scored with their first real opportunity of the half. Jack Cork (right) and Aaron Ramsey l challenge for the ball And it was a goal that did nothing to dispel the criticism of Arsenal's supposed soft centre - which looked even weaker without defender Laurent Koscielny. Two passes was all it took for Swansea. Jordi Amat wrestled Mesut Ozil off the ball far too easily - with Wenger saying after the game that he felt it should have been a free-kick - played one into Jack Cork, and he picked out Routledge, who ran in behind Arsenal's centre-backs and slipped it past Petr Cech. Swansea threw on Sigurdsson at half-time, whose craft in the middle of the park made all the difference as the away side attacked with far more menace. Campbell scores for Arsenal against Swansea And the Iceland international had a golden opportunity to give Swansea the lead after 65 minutes, brilliantly beating Gabriel before taking the ball round Cech - but from there he could only fire wide. It was a narrow angle but you would have backed someone of his quality to score in that situation. Soon afterwards Sanchez rattled the bar again for Arsenal, his attempt from a free-kick came off the head of Sigurdsson and hit the woodwork before bouncing away - once more, Fabianski was well beaten. Joel Campbell is congratulated after scoring for Arsenal And with the game heading into the final quarter of an hour, Swansea grabbed the winner. Sigurdsson fizzed in a wonderful free-kick from the right, and captain Williams was on hand to steer it past Cech from close range. The Gunners pressed for an equaliser, but the Swans held on for a valuable three points. Next up for Wenger is a trip to Tottenham on Saturday, where defeat will surely end their title hopes once and for all.

"report": "Xherdan Shaqiri celebrates scoring the winning goal Newcastle United missed the chance to move out of the relegation zone after a late Xherdan Shaqiri strike saw them lose 1-0 to Stoke City at the Britannia Stadium on Wednesday night. The visitors needed just a point to climb above Norwich City and Sunderland and move out of the bottom three, but fell victim to a brilliant long-range goal from Shaqiri 10 minutes from time. As a result, Stoke rise to seventh in the table and are on course to beat their best-ever Premier League finish of ninth, achieved last season, while Newcastle remain a point from safety in 19th, albeit with a game in hand on their rivals. Newcastle arrived in the Potteries after some recent warm-weather training in La Manga, but without having played a match in 18 days since they were thrashed 5-1 at Chelsea. Stoke boss Mark Hughes was pleased with his side's first-half performance Stoke boss Mark Hughes was pleased with his side's first-half performance However, despite that extra recovery time, Steve McClaren was without influential captain Fabricio Coloccini due a calf injury and with fellow central defender Chancel Mbemba also missing with an ankle problem, the visitors were forced to field a makeshift defence. It was not all bad news though for the Magpies, who were able to welcome back Aleksandar Mitrovic to lead the line, not that you would have known from his meek display in the first half. The Serbia forward was not the only player to fail to hit the heights in the opening 45 minutes, as the closet either side came to scoring was Shaqiri's low effort which Rob Elliot did well to clutch at his near post. The home side - who lost right-back Bardsley to injury after 26 minutes - huffed and puffed before the break, but in windy conditions struggled to create any sustained pressure. Glenn Whelan and Georginio Wijnaldum battle for the ball And it was more of the same in the second period as the contest appeared to be petering out into a draw - a result which would have suited Newcastle nicely - until Shaqiri's intervention. The Swiss playmaker picked up possession some 25 yards from goal, before unleashing a powerful left-footed shot that flew past a flat-footed Elliot. McClaren reacted by throwing on recent new signing Seydou Doumbia for the final five minutes and the Ivorian very nearly rescued a point for his side in stoppage time, but for a sensational reaction save from Jack Butland. Newcastle manager Steve McClaren praised his side's effort Newcastle manager Steve McClaren praised his side's effort Stoke then saw Marko Arnautovic's brilliant volley hit the crossbar with the final kick of the match as they held on to record three league wins in a row.

celebrates after scoring West Ham's opening goal against Tottenham Tottenham fluffed their chance to go top of the Premier League with a 1-0 away defeat at rivals West Ham. The visitors, needing three points to leapfrog leaders Leicester on goal difference, were beaten by an early near-post header from Michail Antonio. Declared favourites to win a first league title in 55 years earlier on Wednesday, the pressure seemed to get to Mauricio Pochettino's young side as they toiled to find an equaliser. Harry Kane went closest in the second half with a shot that was blocked on the line but the Hammers held on. Spurs stay second, three points behind Leicester but three above Arsenal, who lost at home to Swansea, while West Ham closed the gap on fourth-placed Manchester City to one point in their pursuit of a top-four spot. Dimitri Payet and Erik Lamela vie for the ball Spurs missed Dele Alli from the start, who was rested on the bench after picking up an ankle knock against Swansea, as one of four changes that saw the full-backs rotated and Ryan Mason and Nacer Chadli start. Pedro Obiang replaced Sam Byram as the Hammers went 3-5-2 and frustrated Spurs throughout the first-half while threatening on the break and pinching an early goal at the other end. Chadli was caught napping at the near post from a corner on seven minutes, as Antonio stole in front of his Belgian marker and headed too powerfully for Hugo Lloris to keep out. The France international stopper did manage to keep out Mark Noble's fierce long-range effort on 16 minutes but West Ham kept the pressure on the visitors across the pitch and should have had a second before half-time. Tottenham goalkeeper Hugo Lloris is beaten by Antonio's header Noble had another goal-bound shot blocked that then fell to Antonio in the box, but his curling shot was stopped in its tracks by Kevin Wimmer. And the Hammers had a goal disallowed on the stroke of half-time when Antonio fired in from close range but had received the ball from Emmanuel Emenike, who was in an offside position from Cheikhou Kouyate's flick-on. Spurs rediscovered some self-belief and had the better of the second half, and after Ben Davies and Mason sent wayward shots over the bar, Alli emerged to inject more vigour. They went closest to an equaliser when Kane's close-range shot was blocked on the line after Adrian had parried Toby Alderweireld's long-range effort straight into the striker's path. Michail Antonio celebrates with his West Ham team-mates But it remained a night of deep frustration for Pochettino's team, as Antonio turned a cross over the bar while Aaron Cresswell threatened with a volley on the odd occasion West Ham broke on their opponents.

mobbed by team-mates after goal Liverpool gained swift revenge for their Capital One Cup final defeat to Manchester City with a comprehensive 3-0 win over Manuel Pellegrini's side at Anfield. Reds boss Jurgen Klopp opted to rest Philippe Coutinho and Daniel Sturridge after their exertions at Wembley and, in truth, they were not missed as Liverpool went into half-time 2-0 up courtesy of goals from Adam Lallana and James Milner. Lallana then teed up Roberto Firmino to add a third in the second half to effectively end the game as a contest. The result gives Liverpool a league double over City and leaves the visitors' title hopes hanging by a thread as they remain 10 points behind leaders Leicester - albeit with a game in hand. Liverpool flew out of the blocks and ensured the City players had precious little time on the ball in the opening exchanges. Milner celebrates Liverpool's second against City But for all their endeavour they were unable to create any chances of note as City slowly started to grow into the game. Firmino tested Joe Hart from the edge of the box, before Jesus Navas' flashed delivery across goal almost found Sergio Aguero, but the Argentina international was unable to reach the ball at the far post. That signalled the start of a sustained period of City possession in Liverpool territory, however, just as the pressure looked to be building, they were hit with a sucker punch. Milner fed the ball into Lallana who was allowed time and space to advance before firing low past Hart and into the bottom corner from 23 yards. City soon regained their composure and looked for a response, but four minutes from half-time they found themselves further behind. Adam Lallana (right) crosses the ball under pressure Lallana back-heeled ball into Firmino who found Milner bursting through, and the former City player collected the ball beautifully before prodding past Hart. City introduced Wilfried Bony at half-time as they looked for a way back into the game. Former Liverpool winger Raheem Sterling the man to be replaced, much to the delight of the home crowd. But it was to little avail as Liverpool were back in the ascendancy after the break as Divock Origi brought a smart save out of Hart with a shot from a tight angle. The hosts continued to swarm all over City when out of possession and it was that intensity off the ball that brought about the third goal. Sergio Aguero (left) challenges Liverpool's Nathaniel Clyne Lallana nipped in to win back possession 30 yards from goal, skipped past Fernando and played Firmino in on goal - the Brazilian finishing clinically into the corner of the net. Aguero threatened for City, beating a couple of players before being superbly denied by Kolo Toure as he shaped to shoot. Indeed, it was Liverpool who came closest to finding the game's fourth goal, Milner forcing Hart into a save, Jordan Henderson curling a free-kick just wide and Joe Allen hitting a dipping shot from distance that landed on the roof of the net.

With seven minutes remaining, United were looking for inspiration after a lacklustre showing and their stand-in captain provided it, whipping home a pin-point free-kick from 25 yards. Watford created and missed a number of excellent opportunities with Odion Ighalo the chief culprit - he is now without a goal in nine Premier League games. The winning goal sent United level on points with Manchester City in fourth and 10 points behind league leaders Leicester City, although Manuel Pellegrini's men have a game in hand. Timothy Fosu-Mensah, 18, was one of two changes made by Louis van Gaal as he became the third youngest player to start a Premier League game for United. He replaced Michael Carrick, who was rested, while Marcus Rashford continued up front after his double against Arsenal. The young centre-half was given a real workout by a wily Troy Deeney but coped relatively well with his threat. If only his more experienced defensive team-mates followed suit. Memphis Depay attempts to avoid a challenge from Watford's Allan Nyom Daley Blind played a dreadful ball out from the back on 18 minutes but Ighalo squandered the chance from 20 yards, firing straight at David de Gea. Ighalo continued to cause the United back four problems but his lack of composure in front of goal meant Watford failed to capitalise. He latched onto a Deeney flick on 27 minutes and did brilliantly to work himself into space from 12 yards but skewed his effort wide of the post. The chances kept falling to Watford's top scorer but he continued to wilt under pressure. He burst down the right after more sloppy defending by Blind but was denied by De Gea. United continued to struggle to deal with Watford's aggressive game-plan and Guillermo Varela was the next man to present Ighalo with a wonderful chance on 38 minutes. His sloppy back pass was read by the Watford striker but again he fluffed his lines as De Gea stood strong. Manchester United's Anthony Martial has a header on goal against Watford United were non-existent as an attacking force in the opening 45 minutes and although the home crowd called for the intensity to increase, it was Watford that kept up the pace. Etienne Capoue smashed an effort from 30 yards just over the bar before Sebastian Prodl had an effort cleared off the line by Rashford on 51 minutes. Having weathered the relentless Watford storm, United finally got their attacking play going and Mata tested Heurelho Gomes on 60 minutes with a fierce drive that the goalkeeper punched clear. Despite the increased tempo a goal never looked forthcoming and it was Watford - yet again - that created a glorious opening on 79 minutes. Ben Watson's corner was met five yards out by an onrushing Prodl but the defender somehow managed to head wide of the post. Odion Ighalo of Watford challenges Morgan Schneiderlin of Manchester United Rarely do you get away with missing so many chances at Old Trafford and Watford were made to pay. Anthony Martial was fouled about 25 yards from goal, which presented a chance for Mata to strike and he took full advantage, planting the ball perfectly into the top corner. The relief around Old Trafford was clear to see. The top four march is on.

It took the Toffees just five minutes to take the lead as Ramiro Funes Mori capitalised on some slack defending to head the visitors in front on five minutes, before Aaron Lennon rounded off a fine counter on 30 minutes to double the visitors' advantage. Romelu Lukaku made it three on 60 minutes to become the highest-scoring Everton player in a Premier League season with his 17th goal of the campaign - surpassing Tony Cottee's previous record of 16. After large sections of the Villa support left the ground in protest on 74 minutes, substitute Rudy Gestede headed a late consolation as they slipped to an 18th defeat of the season. The result leaves Villa starring relegation in the face, eight points from safety, while Everton leapfrog Merseyside rivals Liverpool into 10th. Aaron Lennon celebrates scoring Everton's second goal against Aston Villa Villa welcomed back forward Jordan Ayew from a three-game suspension ahead of kick-off as one of four changes to the side which lost to Stoke Saturday. Everton, meanwhile, made just one change as Kevin Mirallas replaced Tom Cleverley, who was ill. Not for the first time this season, Garde experimented with his team selection, opting for a back-three, and the change had an adverse effect as Everton took an early lead. Funes Mori managed to get away from Micah Richards in the area, and he had the simple task of heading the ball back across a stricken Brad Guzan. Gabby Agbonlahor and Ashley Westwood of Aston Villa show their frustration after Everton's third goal Everton rarely got into top gear and encouraged Villa to attack, with Funes Mori deflecting a clearance off Agbonlahor which Joel Robles saved on 23 minutes before Ashley Westwood drew the Toffees 'keeper into a smart save shortly after. Those scares, however, did kick Everton into gear and they were two ahead following a swift counter. Barkley released Mirallas down the left where, once in the area, cut the ball back for Lennon to turn past Guzan. Guzan almost gifted Everton a third when he spilled Mirallas' effort into the path of Lukaku, but he atoned for his error by blocking the Belgium international's shot before Joleon Lescott blocked Bryan Oviedo's follow up off the line. Angry Aston Villa supporters leave the stand in the middle of second half against Everton Everton started the second half the livelier of the two sides but Guzan was on hand to keep them at bay, expertly tipping Lukaku's goal-bound header around the post on 59 minutes. But Lukaku was not to be denied. Within a minute he had got on the end of Funes Mori's low centre and turned the ball home from six yards for a landmark goal in both his and Everton's season. The best Villa chances kept falling for Westwood but he couldn't find the target on 63 minutes, smashing an effort into the ground and wide. Rudy Gestede celebrates his consolation against Everton Villa supporters then staged a planned walk-out which left large parts of the stadium empty, but those left were treated to a goal as Gestede rose highest to head home Jordan Veretout's cross 11 minutes from time. The goal threatened to spark a Villa comeback but Everton stood firm, as they had done for most of the game.

A goal in each half did the damage for the hosts with Steve Cook and Benik Afobe getting on the scoresheet, both courtesy of dangerous Matt Ritchie free-kicks which were poorly dealt with by Southampton goalkeeper Fraser Forster. Southampton lost Charlie Austin to a knee injury while Shane Long also hobbled off late in the match, on a miserable night for Ronald Koeman's side. There was worrying scenes just before half-time when fourth official Kevin Friend lost consciousness on the sidelines and hit his head on the dugout. He was treated in the tunnel and was taken to hospital as a precaution. Blooded fourth official Kevin Friend receives treatment The result moves the Cherries eight points clear of the relegation zone. Koeman made three changes to the team that were beaten 2-1 by Chelsea at the weekend but it was Eddie Howe's side that grabbed the early initiative. Strikers Josh King and Afobe caused plenty of problems for the visitors defence with direct running and hard graft presenting a chance for Ritchie inside three minutes - the Scotland international's well-struck effort from a tight angle cleared by Forster. Simon Francis of Bournemouth and Southampton's Oriol Romeu compete for the ball Austin, who Howe came close to signing in his first spell as Bournemouth boss, should have done better on 17 minutes but he blazed wide from 10 yards. That was about as good as it got for the Saints and it was the Cherries who took the lead on 30 minutes. King won a free-kick down the right flank in a position that was perfect for the left footed Ritchie, whose delivery was was palmed, rather flimsily, away from goal by Forster only for Cook to acrobatically turn home from close range for his second goal of the season. The start of the second half was delayed by five minutes as Friend was replaced by Dean Treleaven, a trained referee who was watching the match. Benik Afobe heads the ball past Southampton's Fraser Forster to score Bournemouth's second goal Southampton started the second period much in the same vein, sloppily. Their play was slow and predictable with the Cherries backline very comfortable in dealing with Austin. The former QPR man, who signed in the January window for £4m, was replaced by Graziano Pelle on 59 minutes after suffering a knee injury. He was followed down the tunnel later in the half by Shane Long, who hobbled off also with a knee injury after a collision with Cook. Harry Arter, so dominant in the Bournemouth midfield, was the next man to go down with a problem as the second half never really settled into a rhythm which suited Bournemouth. He was replaced by Dan Gosling. Bournemouth's Steve Cook (left) celebrates scoring his team's first goal against Southampton with team-mate Benik Afobe Pelle made space for himself to work an opening from 25 yards but yet again Arthur Boruc remained untested as the shot whistled past the post. Minutes later, Bournemouth doubled their lead. Ritchie, a Portsmouth fan, curled another wonderful free-kick from the right into the danger area and with Forster rooted to his line, Afobe nipped in to flick a header into the net for his fourth goal since arriving from Wolves in January. Southampton offered little in response and although Sadio Mane forced Boruc into action in the closing stages, the hosts saw the game out comfortably.

Tony Pulis' side had taken the lead through Salomon Rondon in the 11th minute, before Leicester hit back through Danny Drinkwater's deflected strike. The Foxes completed the turnaround in first half stoppage time as Andy King found the net but were forced to settle for a point as Craig Gardner curled home a superb free-kick to level the match early in the second period. Andy King celebrates after putting Leicester 2-1 up against West Brom The result means Leicester go three points clear at the top of the table, although they could be replaced at the summit by Tottenham if Mauricio Pochettino's men win at West Ham on Wednesday. West Brom set their stall out early on, sitting deep and inviting Leicester to break them down. The hosts might well have been expecting that, but they were stunned in the 11th minute as Rondon put Albion ahead. Darren Fletcher slid the ball through and the Venezuelan striker outmuscled Robert Huth before sliding the ball beneath Kasper Schmeichel and into the net. Danny Drinkwater scores Leicester's equalising goal against West Brom Shinji Okazaki almost provided the perfect response for the Foxes but, six yards out, diverted Huth's header from a corner narrowly over the bar. A lull followed for the next 15 minutes as the Baggies continued to frustrate their table-topping opponents, who seemed short of ideas. However, they sprang into life just before the half-hour and soon levelled as Drinkwater's seemingly harmless 25-yard shot flicked off the boot of Jonas Olsson and looped over Ben Foster into the corner of the net. Darren Fletcher and Jamie Vardy challenge for a header While the equaliser was fortuitous, the second showcased the real quality Leicester possess. Marc Albrighton hit a pinpoint crossfield pass that Mahrez back-heeled first-time, on the volley, into the path of King, and the Welshman made no mistake, coolly slotting the ball into the far corner from 12 yards. West Brom refused to be beaten though and drew level again five minutes into the second half. A Mahrez handball gave the visitors a free-kick in a central position, 22 yards out, and Gardner took full advantage, curling the ball beautifully into the top corner with Schmeichel left motionless. Salomon Rondon slips the ball under Leicester goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel to put West Brom 1-0 up While Albion still had their moments - Rondon fired over from six yards - from there on it was Leicester making all of the running. Okazaki powered a header against the bar and Jamie Vardy saw shot saved by the legs of Foster, but it stayed all square heading into the closing stages. The Foxes continued to push for a winner and created two clear openings in the final minutes. The first fell to Wes Morgan, the centre-back shooting straight at Foster after the ball fell kindly to him eight yards out, before Leonardo Ulloa was just unable to force the ball over the line from Mahrez's cross in added time. West Brom held on though with Leicester left to rue missed chances as their unlikely title bid took a knock. Leicester boss Claudio Ranieri says he was very pleased with his side's performance in their 2-2 draw with West Brom.

forced his side into a battle in the second half but was pleased with the way they ultimately earned a 2-1 win at Kenedy scored the fastest Premier League goal of the season to help Chelsea extend their unbeaten run in the Premier League to 12 matches following a 2-1 victory over Norwich at Carrow Road. It took Guus Hiddink's side, who are now up to eighth, just 39 seconds to break the deadlock with Kenedy drilling a low effort past John Ruddy. The Blues doubled their advantage in controversial fashion just before the break through Diego Costa, despite the striker appearing to be in an offside position after collecting Bertrand Traore's pass. Nathan Redmond pulls a goal back for Norwich against Chelsea Norwich, who dropped into the relegation zone on goal difference, pulled a goal back in the 68th minute as Nathan Redmond fired into the roof of the net, but there was to be no comeback as Chelsea held on for a third successive Premier League win for first time since April 2015. Hiddink promised changes and made four following his side's win at Southampton and it was one of the newcomers who made an instant impact. Eden Hazard found Kenedy out on the left flank and the Brazilian cut inside before shifting the ball onto his left foot, striking a low shot across goal and into the bottom corner. Eden Hazard is tackled at Carrow Road Norwich could have found themselves further behind just five minutes later but Traore, on his first start, could not get on the end of Hazard's cutback. In what was an open game, Norwich did eventually respond with Redmond pulling the ball back to Jonny Howson on the edge of the Chelsea penalty area, but his goal-bound shot hit Cameron Jerome and deflected behind for a goal-kick. Jerome was involved again in the 17th minute, rising above Branislav Ivanovic to meet Wes Hoolahan's cross but the striker could not test Thibaut Courtois. Kenedy (second left) celebrates scoring his team's first goal As half-time approached, Hazard's wonderful through ball released Traore, but the 20-year-old's heavy touch allowed Ruddy to gather easily. Alex Neil's side thought they should have had a free-kick when Courtois picked Gary Cahill's pass, but referee Lee Mason saw a slight deflection off Jerome. The hosts were further aggrieved when Traore's pass put Costa through on goal, and the striker clipped the ball over the advancing Ruddy. Replays showed Costa was clearly offside. Diego Costa (second left) celebrates with team-mates after doubling Chelsea's lead against Norwich Norwich started brightly after the break and they should have pulled a goal back when Jerome volleyed over from six yards after Russell Martin's knockdown. Chelsea were looking lacklustre and Hiddink reacted by sending on Willian and John Obi Mikel for Traore and Oscar in the 62nd minute, but six minutes later Norwich had a lifeline. Hoolahan picked out the run of Redmond, who smashed the ball past Courtois and into the roof of the net. Kenedy was withdrawn straight after the goal by Hiddink, with Baba Rahman replacing him as Chelsea looked to hold on. Norwich manager Alex Neil says he is disappointed with the manner of the goals his side conceded against Chelsea as they lost 2-1 at Carrow Road. Norwich manager Alex Neil says he is disappointed with the manner of the goals his side conceded against Chelsea as they lost 2-1 at Carrow Road. However, Norwich continued to press forward in the final 20 minutes as Jerome's flick nestled safely in the gloves of Courtois and substitute Gary O'Neil's shot deflected wide of the far post. Redmond twice went close in the closing stages, before Martin was denied by Courtois in injury time as Chelsea held on to keep Hiddink's unbeaten domestic record intact.

The visitors appeared set to record their first Premier League win of 2016 after Connor Wickham's second-half double had cancelled out Dame N'Doye's 36th-minute opener for the hosts. However, Sunderland's point sees them leapfrog Norwich and move up to 17th in the table, while Palace remain 14th after a club-record 11th Premier League match without a win, a run stretching back to December. Sunderland boss Sam Allardyce made just the one change from the side that lost 1-0 at West Ham United on Saturday, with Jack Rodwell coming in for Lee Cattermole in central midfield. Palace had winger Yannick Bolasie available for the first time since December - an absence that had coincided with the club's winless run in the Premier League - while captain Mile Jedinak was also handed a start as Alan Pardew made two alterations from the weekend loss at West Bromwich Albion. However, in a cagey first half with few real openings it was Palace who created the first chance after 14 minutes, only for Vito Mannone to deny defender Damien Delaney with a smart near-post block. The home team suffered a huge blow just before the half-hour mark when captain John O'Shea was forced off through injury, weakening a back line that already held the joint-worst defensive record in the Premier League heading into this contest. And Sunderland would have almost immediately gone behind, but for a sensational one-handed stop from Mannone to prevent Scott Dann's header - following Yohan Cabaye's left-wing corner - from finding the back of the net. That save proved to be even more important when the Black Cats took the lead nine minutes before the interval thanks to N'Doye's debut strike for the club, albeit with the aid of a big deflection off Scott Dann which wrong-footed Wayne Hennessey in the Palace goal. Sunderland could have even doubled their advantage in first-half injury time, only for substitute Younes Kaboul to somehow miss the target from just three yards out after being found by Wahbi Khazri's inch-perfect free-kick from the left. Palace stepped up the pace in the second period as the home faithful grew more and more agitated, and it was no great surprise when Wickham levelled matters just past the hour-mark. The visitors' flying wingers Bolasie and Wilfried Zaha were involved in a neat interchange of passes on the edge of the box, before the ball was worked wide to Wickham. The former Sunderland striker still had work to do, but the 22-year-old beat Mannone with a sweetly struck effort, although it again took a slight deflection off DeAndre Yedlin on its way past the Italian goalkeeper. Just five minutes later and the Eagles were ahead as that man Wickham, who also scored twice at the Hawthorns on Saturday, volleyed home his fifth goal of the campaign from close range - making him his team's joint top scorer this season - after Cabaye's corner from the right had been headed into his path by Dann at the far post. Those quick-fire twin strikes appeared to knock the stuffing out of Sunderland, who as a last throw of the dice opted to threw on Borini with 10 minutes to go. And it was the Italy striker who rescued a valuable point for the home side after he somehow beat Hennessey from a seemingly impossible angle towards the right-hand corner of the box as the game moved into stoppage time.

The visitors started the game the quicker and should have taken the lead after seven minutes, Nacho Monreal hitting his shot too close to David de Gea when one-on-one after Ozil had flicked a fine first-time pass over the top of the United backline. Rashford showed a flash of what he is capable of soon after, cutting in from the left and bursting between Hector Bellerin and Gabriel before being brought down on the corner of the box. Memphis Depay forced Petr Cech into a save from the resulting free-kick.

Gabriel stretched to cut out the full-back's cross but could only divert it into the path of Rashford (29) who fired high past Cech. Just three minutes later and Rashford was at it again, Jesse Lingard lofting in a cross from the right and the 18-year-old finding space in the box before nodding into the far corner.

Alberto Paloschi put the visitors ahead in a first half full of fine saves from Swans goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski who kept his side ahead at the break. But Nacer Chadli and Danny Rose struck twice in the last 20 minutes to seal a deserved three points for the home side. Spurs remain in second but with Arsenal losing to Manchester United, they are now three points clear of their north London rivals and two behind leaders Leicester, while Swansea remain in 16th position - three points from the relegation places. Nacer Chadli celebrates with Harry Kane Despite Tottenham dominating the first half, Swansea had the first chance of the game inside three minutes as former Spurs man Spurs man Gylfi Sigurdsson saw his effort tipped over the bar by Hugo Lloris from six yards. But Spurs came storming back with their own chances not long after, Erik Lamela shooting over from close range and Fabianski making the first of many great saves to deny Harry Kane at the back post. It was Swansea who took their chance to go ahead after 18 minutes, when Paloschi hit home from Angel Rangel's rebounded effort to stun the home faithful. After that, it was mostly one-way traffic from the home side, with Kyle Walker's fizzing cross evading the outstretched foot of Kane before Dele Alli was denied a penalty by the referee and Lamela's shot from the loose ball only finding the palms of Fabianski. Alberto Paloschi celebrates after scoring for Swansea against Spurs But Swansea did find another opening with seven minutes of the half to play, as Lloris saved brilliantly from another Paloschi effort from 12 yards out after some great work down the right from Rangel. The Swans goalkeeper was once again called into action in the dying seconds of the half, making a brilliant save to deny Eric Dier from six yards after Danny Rose carved up the visiting defence, and Son smashed the rebound into the side netting. Alan Curtis says Swansea defended well but Tottenham's constant pressure finally broke them down Alan Curtis says Swansea defended well but Tottenham's constant pressure finally broke them down The second half started much like the first played out, with Fabianski twice saving from Kane and then stopping another superb free-kick from Eriksen - diving to push the ball onto the crossbar and away from danger. The Tottenham attacks kept coming in waves, with Alli, Dier, Kane and Eriksen continuing to test the mettle of Swansea's defence and the reactions of their superb stopper. Mauricio Pochettino says his Tottenham players are not talking about the title Mauricio Pochettino says his Tottenham players are not talking about the title But they found the breakthrough just before the 70 minute mark, with substitute Chadli turning in a long-range shot from Walker at close-range and finally beating the Polish goalkeeper. It took just seven minutes for Tottenham to add another to their tally, with a cleared corner seeing the ball fall to the feet of Rose - who smashed home from the edge of the area to give Spurs the long-awaited lead.

The hosts could have had a third with ten minutes to play as Kane squared the ball for Walker to tap home, but the flag was already raised for offside and the goal was ruled out. Tottenham saw out the rest of the game with relative ease, staying hot on Leicester's heels with a well-earned win.

Michail Antonio scored the winner on the half-hour mark after an error by Sunderland left-back Patrick Van Aanholt. And the three points sees Slaven Bilic's side temporarily move up to fifth in the Premier League ahead of the weekend's other matches, while Sunderland remain deep in trouble in 19th, a point from safety. The Hammers made three changes from the team that beat Blackburn Rovers 5-1 in the FA Cup last weekend, with Sam Byram, Adrian and Manuel Lanzini coming in for Darren Randolph, Pedro Obiang and Victor Moses. Meanwhile, Sunderland boss Sam Allardyce - on his first return to Upton Park since leaving the club last summer - named an unchanged line-up from the 2-1 win against Manchester United a fortnight ago. And the visitors appeared to have been boosted by that impressive result in the early stages at Upton Park as they sought to end a poor run of just two wins in their last 15 away league games. Antonio celebrates his winner against Sunderland It did not take West Ham long to gain a foothold in the match, with captain Mark Noble inches away from opening the scoring after 20 minutes with a 25-yard shot. However, despite striking his effort sweetly, Sunderland goalkeeper Vito Mannone somehow managed to divert the ball on to the crossbar to deny the midfielder another eye-catching goal after his long-range equaliser at Norwich City last time out. Three minutes later and the Black Cats also struck the woodwork when recent new signing Wahbi Khazri caught Adrian out with a free-kick from the right-hand edge of the area, only for the ball to hit the top of the Spaniard's bar. But it was not long before the hosts opened the scoring, albeit with some help from Van Aanholt who instead of clearing Byram's hopeful ball over the top, was caught in possession by Antonio. Cheikhou Kouyate (right) and Sunderland's Lee Cattermole (left) battle for the ball The winger still had a lot of work to do, however, being in a tight spot by the right-hand corner flag, only to thread an inch-perfect shot into the far corner of the net for his fifth goal for the club, all since late December. Antonio almost doubled West Ham's lead before half-time after a neat turn and volley on the edge of the box which forced Mannone into a smart stop at his near post. But if the Black Cats struggled to make much of an impact in the first half, they were far more threatening after the break as they went in search of a crucial equaliser, with Jermain Defoe a constant menace against his old team. Dame N'Doye (left) vies with Manuel Lanzini Just two minutes into the second period the striker - booed whenever he touched the ball by the home fans - almost took advantage of a mistake at the back by defender James Collins, only to pull his shot just past the post. Sunderland created an even better opening 16 minutes from time after a nice move down the right involving Jan Kirchhoff and DeAndre Yedlin, only for Adrian's right boot to keep out Jack Rodwell's close-range shot, with the substitute then handling the ball before poking the rebound home. As the game got more and more stretched in the final quarter of an hour, chances came and went for both sides. Sunderland's Wahbi Khazri looks dejected after a missed chance West Ham substitute Andy Carroll volleyed against the bar after being set up by Byram's neat header back across the six-yard box, before the young right-back deflected Rodwell's goalbound effort over the bar for a corner. However, despite another important save from Adrian to thwart Dame N'Doye with 10 minutes to go, West Ham held on to extend their unbeaten run at home in the Premier League to 11 matches, their best sequence in 18 years.

could have a huge impact on the title race Leicester are five points clear at the top of the Premier League after substitute Leonardo Ulloa scored in the 89th minute to secure a dramatic 1-0 win over Norwich. Usually ebullient, the leaders were kept in check for the vast majority of the game by a well-organised Norwich side, desperate for points themselves as they battle the drop, However, with time running out for the hosts, Ulloa turned in a low cross from Marc Albrighton to earn a victory which could have a huge impact in the title race. Unfortunate Norwich departed with nothing despite a gutsy display, and were left to rue a first-half miss from Cameron Jerome, who headed wide from close range after getting on the end of a corner. With their title rivals inactive, Leicester had a chance to steal a march, but were stymied early on by a Norwich side who had been cleverly set up by boss Alex Neil. Kasper Schmeichel celebrates after another amazing win for Leicester Defensive trio Russell Martin, Timm Klose and Ryan Bennett kept Jamie Vardy and Shinji Okazaki quiet, while hard-working duo Ivo Pinto and Robbie Brady patrolled the flanks. However, the Canaries were not clinical enough on the break, Jerome taking a poor touch after latching onto a Nathan Redmond pass when he should have shot first-time. Leonardo Ulloa gives his reaction after scoring an 89th minute winner Leonardo Ulloa gives his reaction after scoring an 89th minute winner Leicester enjoyed a brief period of pressure around the quarter-hour mark, Okazaki having a close-range flick well-blocked by Bennett before a Martin clearance flashed just wide of his own goal. Ten minutes later, Riyad Mahrez had a shot blocked by Martin after a delightful feint in the box, and an Albrighton free-kick drifted just wide, with Robert Huth inches away from getting a decisive touch. Russell Martin says Norwich must keep battling to avoid relegation Russell Martin says Norwich must keep battling to avoid relegation But it was far from one-way traffic and Norwich should have taken the lead five minutes before the break as Jerome rose well to get on the end of a terrific Brady corner, only to glance his header wide of the post. The Canaries then had a penalty shout but Wes Morgan did not appear to know much about it as a Jerome shot crashed off his elbow, and referee Neil Swarbrick was probably right not to award a spot-kick. Cameron Jerome squandered a great first-half chance for Norwich Norwich goalkeeper John Ruddy had not been required to make a save in the first-half but he was busier after the break as Leicester upped the ante, getting down well to keep out a Vardy free-kick and a low shot from Albrighton. But the hosts were not exactly laying siege to the Norwich goal and boss Claudio Ranieri called for reinforcements, bringing on Jeff Schlupp, who looked lively on his return from injury, Andy King and Ulloa. Leicester City's Jamie Vardy (right) vies with Norwich City's Timm Klose Leicester City's Jamie Vardy (right) vies with Norwich City's Timm Klose However, it looked like being a very frustrating day for Leicester and Norwich almost went in front with five minutes left, Redmond unleashing a fine shot from distance which flew just wide of the post. But Leicester's amazing season took another stunning turn with a minute left - Mahrez playing in Albrighton, whose superb low right-wing cross was turned in by Ulloa to spark jubilant scenes among the home supporters at the King Power Stadium. Norwich flung on forwards Dieumerci Mbokani and Patrick Bamford, and the latter had a half-chance to snatch a point in injury-time, only to shoot wide after Leicester had struggled to clear a high cross. But the leaders survived and their fans were able to greet the final whistle with a huge roar of relief just a couple of moments later. Leicester find themselves five points clear as of Saturday night The Foxes will now look on with interest at how their title rivals from north London fare on Sunday, before they entertain West Brom in another huge match on Tuesday night. Norwich remain outside the drop zone only on goal difference but, if they continue to show the application and skill they did here, the Canaries will believe safety is attainable. Soccer Saturday verdict - Charlie Nicholas Leicester didn't play poorly, and you have to give credit to Norwich. They came with three at the back that transitioned to five without the ball, and stuck one up front in Jerome, who had pace to burn. It's the best I've seen Norwich in terms of being compact. For the first time today I saw evidence of a shape that suits the team and the new signings. Klose and Pinto were very impressive. Charlie Nicholas gives his thoughts on Leicester’s last gasp win against Norwich. Charlie Nicholas gives his thoughts on Leicester’s last gasp win against Norwich. Vardy had no space and Mahrez was quiet because Norwich suffocated them in the first half. In the second, they were quicker and more direct, and then the 'Tinkerman', or the 'Godfather', whatever Ranieri's title will become, decided to go for it and Ulloa came up with the trick. When the goal went in the crowd went mad, and understandably so. It doesn't matter how you win when you're staring down the barrel of a title challenge. It's a tremendous result for them.

after his late winner Chelsea won back-to-back Premier League games for the first time this season after coming from behind to win 2-1 at Southampton. Shane Long put Saints ahead late in the first half with a composed finish after goalkeeper Fraser Forster had broken a club record for the longest time without conceding. But Saints' resistance was broken in the 75th minute when Cesc Fabregas' cross beat Forster. Branislav Ivanovic then headed in a late winner from a corner as Chelsea extended their unbeaten league run under Guus Hiddink to 10 matches and moved up to 11th in the table. Southampton, who not conceded a goal in over nine hours prior to kick-off, remain seventh but missed the chance to strengthen their push for a European spot. Ronald Koeman handed January signing Charlie Austin his first start in place of Graziano Pelle while Chelsea stuck with the same team that thrashed Manchester City in the FA Cup. Chelsea's Pedro (centre) receives treatment for a injury The visitors were forced into an early change, though, as Pedro suffered an injury and had to be replaced by Oscar. That was perhaps the most notable moment of the opening half-an-hour with chances few and far between. Long headed over the bar from Virgil van Dijk's cross and Oscar shot at Forster at the other end. Interim Chelsea manager Guus Hiddink believes his side deserved all three points Interim Chelsea manager Guus Hiddink believes his side deserved all three points Forster earned applause in the 34th minute as he broke the club record for the longest time without conceding a goal, which was previously held by Paul Jones with 666 minutes. There was more cause for celebration after 42 minutes as the hosts took the lead. Shane Long celebrates scoring the game's opener Baba Rahman tried to cushion a header to a team-mate but Long anticipated it, nicked the ball and then raced clear before coolly chipping Thibaut Courtois. Chelsea had not come from behind to win a game in the Premier League this season but they improved after the break. Still, it looked it might not be their day after Jon Obi Mikel headed wide from six yards out and Diego Costa missed the target with a volley from Eden Hazard's cross. Ronald Koeman was disappointed to see his Southampton side lose Ronald Koeman was disappointed to see his Southampton side lose Chelsea's frustration continued to mount as Costa was booked for clipping Van Dijk's heels and Saints defended resolutely. However, the visitors eventually got the breakthrough after 75 minutes when Fabregas crossed from the left and Forster, thinking Hazard was going to make contact, didn't move as the ball drifted into the net. The visitors pressed on for the winner and were rewarded late on as Ivanovic rose highest for a corner and headed past Forster, who got a strong hand to it but couldn't keep it out. Chelsea players celebrate their second goal against Southampton Soccer Saturday verdict - Paul Merson It was a great finish from Long for the opener, and Southampton had to be in front because of the strong wind in their favour in the first half. In the second, Chelsea turned the screw and Forster should make the save from Fabregas. He goes for Hazard and doesn't go for the ball, anticipating the touch from the Chelsea attacker. You have to go with the ball. There was only one winner after the goal, and that was Chelsea. It was a bullet header from Ivanovic, but rather than just save it, Forster tries to push it out. For how good a 'keeper he is, and he is top drawer, he should have saved both goals. Chelsea reminded me of the team that won the league last year, they really ground out the result. There's not many players in the Premier League that can take a game by the scruff of the neck, but Fabregas is one of them. He got on the ball and Southampton couldn't get near him.

Following a lacklustre opening 45 minutes, Arnautovic celebrated his 100th appearance for the club by smashing home from the penalty spot after Ashley Westwood's clumsy challenge on Phil Bardsley. And they soon doubled their advantage with Austria international Arnautovic making the most of Xherdan Shaqiri's cross by chesting the ball over the line. Leandro Bacuna set up a grandstand finish after firing home with 11 minutes remaining, but an equaliser never looked likely and the defeat, Villa's 10th away from home in the league this season, leaves them nine points adrift of safety with only 11 games remaining to salvage their top-flight status. Bojan had to make do with a place on the bench with Ibrahim Afellay preferred by City boss Mark Hughes. Arnautovic [centre] celebrates with team-mates after scoring his second goal Marc Muniesa (hamstring), Glen Johnson (knee) and captain Ryan Shawcross (back) were ruled out, but Phil Bardsley (hip) and Geoff Cameron (ankle) were passed fit and made the starting line-up. Remi Garde dropped skipper Micah Richards to the bench which meant a return to action for full-back Alan Hutton as they looked to put in a much-improved performance from the 6-0 drubbing at the hands of Liverpool last time out - the club's worst home loss in 81 years. Rudy Gestede and Gabby Agbonlahor were fit again, with the former on the bench, but an ailing defence knew they were going to be tested by a Stoke side bolstered by new arrival Giannelli Imbula from Porto. Stoke boss Mark Hughes says his side needed to raise the intensity in the second half to secure a win Stoke boss Mark Hughes says his side needed to raise the intensity in the second half to secure a win And the £18.3m signing was looking the part for the hosts, who were aiming to complete a Premier League double over Villa. They came within inches of breaking the deadlock in the only real chance of the first half after just seven minutes as Villa goalkeeper Mark Bunn was forced into making a superb acrobatic save. Afellay's cross from the right took a nasty deflection off Jores Okore and looked to be looping into the top corner until Bunn showed great agility to claw the ball away from under his own crossbar. Giannelli Imbula [left] takes the ball past Leandro Bacuna Villa's good defensive work was undone at the beginning of the second half. Six minutes after the restart Ashley Westwood brought down Bardsley with a clumsy challenge following a clever lofted reverse pass by the influential Shaqiri. Arnautovic celebrated his 100th appearance with a no-nonsense penalty, drilling it high down the middle of the goal past Bunn. Aston Villa boss Remi Garde says his side started the second half slowly, which cost them dearly Aston Villa boss Remi Garde says his side started the second half slowly, which cost them dearly The Potters doubled their advantage five minutes later and Arnautovic was at it again. His header from Afellay's cross looped up in the air but the Austrian reacted quickest to chest the ball over the line from a yard out. It was Arnautovic's sixth Premier League goal at the Britannia this season; twice as many as any other Stoke player. Villa set up a grandstand finish with 11 minutes remaining when the ball fell kindly to Bacuna and he hit a shot across Jack Butland and into the far corner of the net from the right side of the penalty area. Young Villa supporters look positive prior to the match at the Britannia Stadium Bunn was forced to dive at full stretch to push away a header from Okore in the dying minutes as the hosts held on for victory. Villa manager Garde has won just three of his 19 games since replacing the sacked Tim Sherwood in November and his troubled club look destined to drop into the second tier for the first time since 1988. Soccer Saturday verdict - Phil Thompson Stoke's fans were probably looking at this game thinking it would be comfortable, but it was poor from both sides right up to half-time. I don't think Butland made a save in the first half, but Villa would have been happy at the break. Hughes probably had a right go at his players and Villa could only hold on for six minutes. Shaqiri had a hand in both goals, but the second is absolutely shambolic from Villa's point of view. Bunn ends up in the back of the net and everybody watches the ball as it hits Arnautovic on the chest. It was a poor game all round but Hughes will be delighted with the win.

The result sees Bournemouth move five points clear of the relegation zone in 15th, while Watford drop to 10th. A highlight for the Cherries, though, was the return of Max Gradel after six months out injured. The game started brightly and Odion Ighalo could have put Watford in front inside two minutes.

Gomes had also tipped wide a great 25-yard effort from Harry Arter on the hour mark, and also denied substitute Dan Gosling in the closing stages after the Bournemouth midfielder failed to control the ball when it had dropped to him in the area. Eddie Howe felt his Bournemouth side had the better chances Eddie Howe felt his Bournemouth side had the better chances Undoubtedly the biggest chance of the afternoon for Watford fell to Ighalo after 67 minutes. January signing Nordin Amrabat got down the right and put one on a plate for the striker, but he could only send his header over when completely unmarked in the middle of the box. Next up for Watford is a trip to Manchester United on Wednesday night, while Bournemouth host Southampton on Tuesday. Watford boss Quique Flores says the stalemate was a fair result for both sides Watford boss Quique Flores says the stalemate was a fair result for both sides Soccer Saturday verdict - Alan McInally After three defeats on the spin for Bournemouth, I think Eddie Howe privately might have taken the point before the game but it's certainly one they could have nicked. Gradel on his return was very good. I think there's plenty of time for him to play a part before the season's end. It's like signing a new player, and he was involved in everything in the final third, although he missed a good chance. I was a little disappointed in Watford, but it was a good game in general. Both goalkeepers had important saves to make but Gomes was the busier of the two. He was unbelievable and one save from Arter - you can see by Howe's reaction he thinks Harry has scored.\" Alan McInally gives his thoughts on Watford’s 0-0 draw with Bournemouth at Vicarage Road.

celebrates scoring Baggies' second goal of the game West Brom beat Crystal Palace 3-2 at the Hawthorns on Saturday to leave Alan Pardew's side without a win in 10 Premier League games. It was three goals from three chances in the first-half for the Baggies, who took the lead through Craig Gardner's close-range effort, before Craig Dawson made it 2-0 with a header. Saido Berahino's fine finish had them three up after 31 minutes to add to Palace's first-half woes, though Connor Wickham did give them hope by pulling a goal back just after half-time. Craig Gardner (L) celebrates scoring the opening goal in the first half Wickham set up a nervy final 10 minutes with a superb half-volley from the left of the penalty area, and despite Scott Dann going close late on, West Brom held on. The result moves Tony Pulis' Baggies up a place to 13th in the Premier League, 11 points clear of the relegation zone, while Palace are 14th, eight points from danger. Tony Pulis said he was delighted with West Brom's form after their 3-2 win Tony Pulis said he was delighted with West Brom's form after their 3-2 win Pulis made four changes from the side that lost 3-1 at Reading in the FA Cup fifth round last weekend, and it was Gardner, one of those returning players, who opened the scoring. After Berahino played Salomon Rondon through on goal at a slight angle, the Venezuelan's effort across Wayne Hennessey was parried to the feet of Gardner, who tapped into the empty net on 12 minutes. West Brom's Chris Brunt is taken to a stretcher in the first half It was 2-0 eight minutes later as Gardner turned provider, seeing his free-kick from the right headed into the bottom corner by the unmarked Dawson from 10 yards. With their third clear-cut chance of the game, the Baggies made it 3-0 in the 31st minute, Berahino guiding a superb volley into the bottom corner from Stephane Sessegnon's searching diagonal over Dann's head. Alan Pardew felt his side lost the game inside the first 30 minutes Alan Pardew felt his side lost the game inside the first 30 minutes It was almost 4-0 before half-time, but Gardner's low free-kick from nearly 35 yards was deflected onto the outside of the left post by Joel Ward. There was a worry for West Brom and Northern Ireland just before half-time, with midfielder Chris Brunt taken off on a stretcher with a serious-looking knee injury, 15 weeks before Euro 2016 begins. Emmanuel Adebayor was brought off at half-time for Yannick Bolasie Palace came back into the game against the run of play in the second half through Wickham, who lifted the ball over Ben Foster and finished from an acute angle after Jonas Olsson had failed to shepherd the striker away from danger. West Brom went up the other end and came within inches of getting regaining three-goal cushion through Berahino, whose superb curling effort from 20 yards hit the upright. Referee Jon Moss waved away two Crystal Palace penalty appeals in the second-half, the first coming after Dann was pushed from a corner by Gareth McAuley, before Yannick Bolasie, a half-time substitute for Emmanuel Adebayor, was clipped by the knee of McAuley with 17 minutes remaining. Alan Pardew felt his side lost the game inside the first 30 minutes Alan Pardew felt his side lost the game inside the first 30 minutes Wickham got his second on 80 minutes with a sublime far-post half-volley after McAuley had poked the ball clear, finishing into the far right corner past several bodies in the area.

Welbeck struck late on to break Leicester's resolve after the league leaders looked to have survived 40 minutes with a man down, following Danny Simpson's dismissal for a second bookable offence. Jamie Vardy's first-half penalty seemed to have set the Foxes on their way to victory until substitute Theo Walcott struck 10 minutes after coming off the bench to ignite a late Arsenal revival. Both Thierry Henry and Jamie Carragher were full of praise for Leicester Both Thierry Henry and Jamie Carragher were full of praise for Leicester The inspired Kasper Schmeichel and Leicester's valiant defensive unit kept Arsenal at bay only for Welbeck, making his first appearance since April 2015, to strike deep into stoppage time. Danny Welbeck made his long awaited return from injury and scored the winner Danny Welbeck made his long awaited return from injury and scored the winner The result moves Arsenal above north London rivals Tottenham into second spot and, crucially, to within two points of leaders Leicester. Arsene Wenger made two changes to the Arsenal side fielded at Bournemouth, with Per Mertesacker replacing the injured Gabriel and Mathieu Flamini making way for Francis Coquelin, who made his first Premier League start since November, while Leicester were unchanged from the side that comprehensively beat Manchester City last weekend. Theo Walcott's (left) neat finish sparked Arsenal's revival Arsenal made the brighter start as Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain was played in behind the Leicester defence, but Simpson was on hand to clear before the right-back forced Alexis Sanchez to head the resulting corner wide inside two minutes. Oxlade-Chamberlain was involved again after as his chipped pass appeared to strike N'Golo Kante's arm, but referee Martin Atkinson was unmoved. Mesut Ozil (left) holds off the attentions of Robert Huth A cagey opening 10 minutes passed before the game sprung into life as both sides exchanged blows in search of an opener. First, Christian Fuchs played Shinji Okazaki through on goal, only for the offside flag to deny the striker. Aaron Ramsey was then played into acres of space prompting Schmeichel to race off his line on 15 minutes to intervene, before Petr Cech produced a brilliant save to keep out Vardy's low header a minute later. Arsene Wenger was delighted with his 2-1 win over title rivals Leicester Arsene Wenger was delighted with his 2-1 win over title rivals Leicester Olivier Giroud and Sanchez were then denied by Leicester captain Wes Morgan, who threw his body in the way of shots twice in the space of five minutes, before Giroud's 31st-minute header was ruled out for offside. And the Foxes took advantage of their reprieve as Vardy ended a brisk counter by drawing Nacho Monreal into a rash challenge which left Atkinson with no choice but to award the spot-kick. Jamie Vardy scored the opening goal from the penalty spot The England striker dusted himself down and rattled the ball home from 12 yards - his 19th Premier League goal of the season. Arsenal were forced to replace Laurent Koscielny at half-time due to an injury, but that failed to prevent Arsenal from flying out of the traps when played resumed, with Ramsey dragging an early shot wide. Vardy celebrates with team-mates Monreal was lucky to avoid giving another penalty away as he brought Riyad Mahrez to ground in the area, but this time Atkinson waved the claims away. The game then swung in Arsenal's favour as Simpson picked up two yellow cards in quick succession, the second for bringing Giroud to ground. Claudio Ranieri felt the decision to send off Danny Simpson was severe Claudio Ranieri felt the decision to send off Danny Simpson was severe Mahrez was sacrificed as Leicester battened down the hatches, and Arsenal's pressure soon told as Walcott rifled home superbly after Giroud's fine knock-down in the area. Arsenal continued to throw bodies forward against a tiring Leicester team, but Schmeichel proved impenetrable. Theo Walcott's (left) neat finish sparked Arsenal's revival Welbeck was brought off the bench to make his first appearance of the season, having been sidelined for 10 months after undergoing knee surgery, and it proved to be a comeback to remember for the England international, as his deft flicked header saw the Gunners finally beat Schmeichel with the last kick of the game.

James Milner celebrates with team-mates after his cross found the bottom corner for the second goal Kolo Toure hit Liverpool's sixth and final goal from a corner, and the result leaves Liverpool in eighth, two points off the top six, while Villa stay bottom, eight points from safety with 12 games remaining. Villa were unchanged from the side that beat Norwich 2-0 last weekend, while Liverpool striker Sturridge was starting his first Premier League game since October 4, returning alongside Philippe Coutinho and Toure. Divock Origi is mobbed by Liverpool fans after scoring. And it was Coutinho who fed former Villa youth player Sturridge for the opener on 16 minutes, curling in a superb cross from the left for the England striker, who had got between Villa centre-halves Jores Okore and Joleon Lescott to glance a header into the bottom corner. Liverpool doubled their lead nine minutes later as Milner, another former Villa man, saw his free-kick from the left go through the crowd in the penalty area and into the bottom corner. It should have been three moments later as Roberto Firmino found Milner at the far post to head down to Jordan Henderson, but the Liverpool captain's effort from close range deflected inches wide of the left-hand post.

Liverpool ran riot in the second half, starting with Can's long-range effort into the bottom left corner after some sloppy defending from Leandro Bacuna allowed him time to shoot.

Jurgen Klopp congratulates the returning Daniel Sturridge. It was five two minutes later, Clyne scoring his first Premier League goal since November 2014 on the second attempt in front of an open goal after seeing his first close-range effort saved by Bunn. Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp was full of praise for his team Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp was full of praise for his team Henderson's corner was then headed into the top left corner by an unmarked Toure for Liverpool's sixth, making it four goals in 13 minutes, and marking their biggest win under Jurgen Klopp. Villa did hit the post late on through Scott Sinclair's effort from the edge of the area, but the performance poses more worrying questions as time runs out on their ever-present Premier League tenure.

blow to Manchester City’s hopes in the process as Christian Eriksen’s late strike sealed a 2-1 victory at the Etihad Stadium. The visitors, who started the game in third following Arsenal's 2-1 win at Leicester, took the lead after Mark Clattenburg controversially awarded a 53rd minute penalty when Danny Rose's cross hit Raheem Sterling under the arm right on the edge of the penalty area. The referee pointed to the spot and Harry Kane made no mistake to score his 16th Premier League goal of the season, before substitute Kelechi Iheanacho equalised in the 74th minute. Did the ball strike Raheem Sterling on the arm? However, Eriksen sealed all three points for Mauricio Pochettino's side as they moved back above their north London rivals into second and just two points behind league leaders Leicester. Meanwhile, City, who have won just one of their 10 Premier League games against sides currently in the top eight this season, face an almighty battle to win the title with defeat leaving Manuel Pellegrini's side six points behind the leaders with 12 games to play. Goalscorer Harry Kane was happy with Tottenham's performance Goalscorer Harry Kane was happy with Tottenham's performance Pellegrini made three changes to the City side that suffered defeat at home to Leicester, with captain Vincent Kompany, who made his first start since his side's 0-0 draw with Aston Villa back in November, Gael Clichy and Fernando coming into the starting line-up for Martín Demichelis, Aleksander Kolarov and Fabian Delph, while Spurs also made changes with Dele Alli, Rose and Son Heung-min replacing Erik Lamela, Ben Davies and Nacer Chadli. It was the visitors that started brightly, pushing the full-backs Rose and Kyle Walker on at every opportunity, however, it was City who had the first sight of goal with Sergio Aguero hooking over from 12 yards in the 10th minute following David Silva's corner. Another angle of the penalty incident City looked a threat going forward with Raheem Sterling connecting a sweet volley 12 yards out only to be denied by a brilliant last-ditch block from Rose, but Tottenham were more than holding their own against Pellegrini's side. Challenges were flying in all over the pitch as both sides looked to stamp their authority on the game and in the 29th minute Eriksen's 25-yard strike forced Joe Hart into his first save of the afternoon. Pochettino would have been pleased with what he was seeing from his side as they dominated possession but they could not make it count in the final third with Eric Dier firing over from distance and Rose's goal-bound shot deflected over the bar by Pablo Zabaleta. Mauricio Pochettino (l) celebrates Spurs' victory at Man City Five minutes after the restart, Aguero had a glorious chance to give City the lead, but he fired over from the corner of the six-yard box after Yaya Toure's shot deflected into his path. And they were made to pay in the 53rd minute when Rose's cross hit Sterling under the arm right on the edge of the penalty area and the Clattenburg pointed to the spot. Kane stepped up to fire the penalty straight down the middle to score his 15th goal in his last 17 Premier League appearances. Kane gives Spurs the lead from the penalty spot City, who felt aggrieved by the decision, responded well and could have been on level terms four minutes later when Toure curled a free-kick over the wall, but the ball rebounded off the crossbar. Pellegrini responded by throwing on Iheanacho for Fernando in the 66th minute and the young striker repaid his manager's faith, firing home Clichy's cut-back from the penalty spot 16 minutes from time. Jamie Carragher and Thierry Henry both thought that Tottenham shouldn't have been awarded a penalty Jamie Carragher and Thierry Henry both thought that Tottenham shouldn't have been awarded a penalty Moving into the final 10 minutes the momentum was with City and the visitors needed Hugo Lloris to palm away Toure's powerful drive. But it was Spurs, who struck the decisive blow with substitute Lamela sliding through an inch-perfect ball for Eriksen, who, on his 24th birthday, fired the ball under Hart to start the celebrations in the away end. Christian Eriksen celebrated his 24th birthday by scoring Tottenham's winner There was still time for Kane to flash a shot wide as he looked to make the points completely safe, but in injury time it was the hosts that went close to stealing a point. Lloris could only palm away a cross only as far as Silva, but the Spanish midfielder thrashed the ball over the bar from inside the six-yard box.

their first Premier League win over the Red Devils at the Stadium of Light. The Black Cats raced into an early lead thanks to Wahbi Khazri's third-minute strike before Anthony Martial hauled United level with his 10th goal of the season on 39 minutes. The hosts created the better chances after the break and deservedly edged in front as Lamine Kone's powerful header forced David de Gea to turn the ball into his own net. Sunderland saw out the victory with relative ease to move to within a point of rivals Newcastle and safety, while United remain fifth, six points adrift of fourth place. United travelled to Wearside looking to apply some pressure on the clubs directly above them in the league and made one change to the side which drew at Chelsea last weekend, as Morgan Schneiderlin replaced Marouane Fellaini in midfield. Sunderland's Lamine Kone (left centre) heads the ball in-off Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea to score their second goal Sam Allardyce handed Dame N'Doye his first start and Khazri his home debut following their arrivals in January, and the latter made the perfect start as United were caught cold on three minutes. Khazri's low, in-swinging free-kick from the left crucially evaded Jermain Defoe and the United defence before it nestled in the far corner of the unsighted de Gea's goal. Falling behind seemed to kicked United into gear but they struggled to break down a resolute Black Cats defence, with Wayne Rooney denied the chance to respond by Kone immediately after. Louis van Gaal surveys the scene at Sunderland alongside Ryan Giggs Sunderland could, and probably should, have been two up in 10 minutes as Lee Cattermole forced the ball into Defoe but the striker miscued his effort from close range. Within two minutes the hosts had to reshuffle their defensive set up as Jan Kirchhoff was forced off with a suspected hamstring injury, but they continued to keep United at bay. It took United 31 minutes to register an attempt on the Sunderland goal and, when it did arrive, Juan Mata's well-struck effort went straight down Vito Mannone's throat. Anthony Martial in action with DeAndre Yedlin at the Stadium of Light United's defensive injury crisis then deepened as Matteo Darmian was then forced off with a shoulder injury, with 21-year-old Donald Love replacing the right-back. Undeterred, United pushed forward and were soon level. Having denied Mata earlier, Mannone made a meal of the Spaniard's second attempt, pawing it into the path of Martial who chipped the ball home from an acute angle six minutes before the interval. Sunderland started the second half in similar fashion to which they had the first and had strong penalty claims denied on 48 minutes, with referee Andre Marriner ruling Rooney not to have deliberately handled John O'Shea's flick-on in the box. Wayne Rooney controls the ball under pressure of DeAndre Yedlin The Black Cats then laid siege on the United goal but Defoe failed to turn Patrick van Aanholt's cross home at the near post as Daley Blind cleared. Shortly after the hour-mark, De Gea stuck a leg out to deflect N'Doye's goal-bound effort away before leaping to his left to deny Khazri's free-kick. Cameron Borthwick-Jackson then supplied substitute Memphis Depay with United's best chance ten minutes from time, but Mannone saved the Dutchman's curling strike. Lamine Kone (R) of Sunderland celebrates his team's second goa And the visitors were made to pay just two minutes later. Kone rose highest to meet Khazri's corner and his header forced De Gea to inadvertently fumble the ball over the line, handing the Black Cats their first home league win over United since 1997.

The midfielder broke the deadlock with a brilliant long-range strike after just nine minutes, before quick-fire goals at the start of the second half from Ibrahim Afellay and Joselu ended the game as a contest. The home side did respond immediately through substitute Matt Ritchie's well-struck effort, but Stoke held on to record their first away win since December - moving up to ninth in the process - with Bournemouth remaining 15th, four points from safety. Cherries boss Eddie Howe brought in Junior Stanislas in place of Ritchie, who was on the bench, after last weekend's home loss to Arsenal, while, Stoke were without the sick Marko Arnautovic. However, the visitors were able to welcome back Jonathan Walters from illness as they looked to end a dreadful recent run of more than six hours without a Premier League goal. And it took the Potters just nine minutes to end their scoring drought, and what a strike it was too as new boy Imbula opened the scoring with memorable long-range goal. Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe said it was a tough afternoon for his side Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe said it was a tough afternoon for his side There was an element of luck to it as, following a throw-in on the left, the ball fell kindly at the feet of the Frenchman, who cost £18.3m from Porto in the January transfer window, and the midfielder unleashed a sweetly-struck shot that flew past a helpless Artur Boruc in Bournemouth's goal. That early strike appeared to settle Stoke's nerves, with the Potters arriving on the south coast on the back of 3-0 defeats in their last three Premier League games, and they really should have extended their lead before half-time. However, Walters - after a clever turn on the edge of the box - saw a half volley beat Boruc, only to hit the side-netting, before the always busy Xherdan Shaqiri tested the Poland international with a swerving effort from just outside the area. Those near misses were soon forgotten, though, when Stoke scored twice in three minutes at the start of the second period, with the first of those goals coming when down to 10 men with Glen Johnson off the pitch receiving treatment for a knee injury. Mark Hughes thought his side showed good intensity in their 3-1 win over Bournemouth Mark Hughes thought his side showed good intensity in their 3-1 win over Bournemouth That mattered little as Walters made his way to the right-hand corner of the box, before pulling the ball back perfectly for Afellay to score his first-ever Premier League goal with a low shot into the bottom corner of the net. Stoke boss Mark Hughes was forced to introduce Joselu for Johnson, and the Spaniard wasted little time before further increasing the visitors' lead as he headed home Shaqiri's inch-perfect right-wing centre after a corner. Bournemouth's Matt Ritchie said the club felt disappointed to have lost 3-1 to Stoke Bournemouth's Matt Ritchie said the club felt disappointed to have lost 3-1 to Stoke Bournemouth may have been shell shocked by the start to the second half, but they soon got themselves back into the contest thanks to a lovely goal from Ritchie, who had replaced Dan Gosling at the break. The ball was fired into the box from the left wing, with the midfielder's impressive left-footed strike flying past a motionless Butland in Stoke's goal to make it three goals in just five second-half minutes However, that proved to be the end of the scoring rush as Stoke's makeshift back line held out for a morale-boosting first league win on the road since they beat Everton 4-3 on December 28. Stoke's Jonathan Walters said their win over Bournemouth was a massive three points Stoke's Jonathan Walters said their win over Bournemouth was a massive three points For Howe and Bournemouth, though, that is now back-to-back home defeats in their bid to beat the drop.

Deeney of Watford celebrates scoring his team's second goal Troy Deeney's eighth and ninth goals of the season helped Watford consign Crystal Palace to a fifth Premier League defeat in their last six games. The Hornets skipper scored a controversially-awarded penalty after 16 minutes and then settled the contest with a clinical strike seven minutes from time. Emmanuel Adebayor had levelled the game on the stroke of half-time with his first goal in Palace colours, expertly heading home Connor Wickham's cross. But Deeney was to leave his mark on the match as the hosts were consigned to another defeat and one made even more painful by the dismissal of Pape Souare for a dreadful challenge on Valon Behrami in stoppage time. Deeney scores the opening goal from the penalty spot Referee Robert Madley made the bold decision to award Watford a penalty for Mile Jedinak's manhandling of Deeney at a corner; the call will be cited as a controversial one because it is rare for fouls to be awarded in such situations but it was unquestionably a foul. Palace, with their confidence perhaps at a low ebb following their recent struggles, did not provide much of a response to the setback and in fact it was Watford who were the dominant attacking force for the rest of the first half. Goalscorer Troy Deeney praised Watford's battling performance Goalscorer Troy Deeney praised Watford's battling performance They should have doubled their lead when Jedinak sloppily gave the ball away in midfield, it was fed in to Odion Ighalo down the inside-left channel, and he cut outside his marker before striking a shot which goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey blocked with a foot at his near post. The ball was then played back into the box, where Nordin Amrabat held off his marker and got a shot away which was blocked on the line, before proceeding to give away a foul as he competed for the second ball. Deeney celebrates scoring his first goal at Crystal Palace Ighalo spurned another chance to put his side two up when he lazily threw a leg at a superb Deeney header into him three minutes before half-time and moments later Adebayor equalised. Wickham's long throw was headed only partially clear by Ben Watson, with Jedinak seizing on the loose ball to return it to Wickham at full stretch; from there, he picked out his strike partner with a fine cross which was expertly headed into the far corner by Adebayor. Emmanuel Adebayor is congratulated after equalising for Palace The goal revitalised Palace for the second half and for long periods of it they were the better side. Jordon Mutch drew a good save from Heurelho Gomes and Adebayor had an even better chance well saved from 10 yards out. Emmanuel Adebayor believes Crystal Palace deserved to take something from their defeat to Watford Emmanuel Adebayor believes Crystal Palace deserved to take something from their defeat to Watford He later looped a header goalwards which Gomes saved well despite being fouled by Fraizer Campbell but Watford were not a spent force and Hennessey made a good stop of his own from a low Nathan Ake shot. That warning, however, went unheeded, and Deeney showed excellent composure to steady himself and fire home after Ben Watson's fine first-time cross had skimmed into his path off the head of Damien Delaney. Watford boss Quique Sanchez Flores was full of praise for captain Troy Deeney Watford boss Quique Sanchez Flores was full of praise for captain Troy Deeney On the stroke of 90 minutes, Yohan Cabaye hit a dipping shot against the foot of the post as the hosts attempted to salvage something from the game. But no further goalscoring chances were fashioned and the despair was deepened when Souare was sent off by referee Robert Madley for a two-footed challenge on Behrami. Paul Merson says Troy Deeney was a class above the rest of the players on display during Watford's 2-1 win at Crystal Palace Paul Merson says Troy Deeney was a class above the rest of the players on display during Watford's 2-1 win at Crystal Palace Soccer Saturday verdict - Paul Merson Troy Deeney doesn't surprise me, he is a very good footballer. He was the best player on the pitch, class wise. Adebayor looked quite sharp, and scored a great header. With two up front, Watford are always a threat. Watford went on a bit of a dodgy run, but then all of a sudden started picking up points again. For me they safe, and can focus on the FA Cup. Everywhere they go, they have a go. Bolasie is nearly fit, and Palace need him. They are not getting any luck at all at the moment either. I'd be shocked if they went down.

Everton, who had 76 per cent possession and 34 attempts on goal, had several chances to equalise in both halves as both Ross Barkley and Tom Cleverley hit the woodwork, but West Brom held on for their first league away win since October 24.

Low and behold, they put in a defensive performance like this. The reaction Tony Pulis has got from his players was incredible. They were defending for their lives. Roberto Martinez will be raging. Lennon was sensational in the first half. Everton created enough chances, but they just couldn't score. 17 attempts in the first half is incredible. Ross Barkley had a good game, but he didn't influence the game enough for his ability. It is a massive, massive three points for West Brom.

"report": "Mark Noble of West Ham United celebrates scoring his team's second goal West Ham scored two goals in as many second-half minutes to earn a 2-2 draw with Norwich at Carrow Road. After a first half where chances were few and far between, Norwich burst into life after the break with Robbie Brady (54) and Wes Hoolahan (65) giving their side a two-goal advantage. However, West Ham fought back through goals from Dimitri Payet, who signed a new five-year deal with the club in midweek, and Mark Noble as Slaven Bilic's side moved to within a point of Manchester United in sixth despite dropping below Southampton to seventh on goal difference. Dimitri Payet of West Ham United scores his team's first goal Norwich ended a run of five straight Premier League defeats but Alex Neil's side, who are without a win in seven games in all competitions, sit one place above the relegation zone on goal difference. Norwich, who made two changes from the 2-0 defeat at Aston Villa with Nathan Redmond and Cameron Jerome replacing Youssouf Mulumbu and Dieumerci Mbokani, started on the front foot as Russell Martin fired over from the edge of the penalty area in the opening minute. Norwich City's Timm Klose (right) tussles with West Ham United's Dimitri Payet After some early Norwich pressure, West Ham gradually grew into the game with Mark Noble releasing Enner Valencia through on goal, but Sebastien Bassong recovered well to usher the striker away before he could get a shot off. However, Valencia did not make the same mistake twice, taking on a shot from an awkward angle in the 18th minute to test John Ruddy, who smartly tipped the ball over the crossbar. Norwich manager Alex Neil was left disappointed after his side threw away a 2-0 lead over West Ham to draw 2-2. Norwich manager Alex Neil was left disappointed after his side threw away a 2-0 lead over West Ham to draw 2-2. West Ham were enjoying good possession but chances were thin on the ground for the Hammers as Norwich started to reassert themselves on the game as the clock ticked towards half-time. First, Brady fired a free-kick over from 25 yards before a well-worked corner saw Jonny Howson hit the ball over from the edge of the box. Cameron Jerome of Norwich City is blocked by Angelo Ogbonna Obinza of West Ham United The pressure was building as the hosts looked to break the deadlock but they just could not hit the target with Steven Naismith firing wide, before Martin blazed over after good work from Jerome. West Ham, who looked jaded after their 120-minute FA Cup tie in midweek against Liverpool, started the second half in sloppy fashion with James Collins giving the ball away to Naismith, who released Hoolahan, but the midfielder could not pull the ball back for the unmarked Jerome. Robbie Brady of Norwich City celebrates scoring his team's first goal The visitors were punished just minutes later though with Michail Antonio losing the ball to Brady, who charged forward before curling a thunderous shot past Adrian and into the top corner. The hosts doubled their advantage nine minutes later when Naismith's shot deflected into the path of the unmarked Hoolahan, who swept the ball past Adrian from close range. Mark Noble thought West Ham should have come away with three points Mark Noble thought West Ham should have come away with three points West Ham responded by bringing on Andy Carroll and Victor Moses for Valencia and Alex Song and it was Moses who helped the visitors grab a lifeline, bursting into the penalty area before forcing Ruddy into a smart save. The rebound fell to the feet of Payet, who celebrated his new deal by powering the ball into the roof of the net. Mark Noble of West Ham United scores his team's second goal at Norwich Within two minutes the visitors were level, with Payet this time turning provider. The Frenchman, who has scored or assisted 12 Premier League goals this season, picked out Noble on the edge of the area and the midfielder smashed a first-time shot past Ruddy and into the top corner. There was still time for both sides to win it, with Moses and substitute Emmanuel Emenike both driving over, while Redmond was inches from a last-gasp winner for the hosts after his shot deflected wide. Phil Thompson said Norwich would not have escaped with a point in the game against West Ham if the game had been five minutes longer Phil Thompson said Norwich would not have escaped with a point in the game against West Ham if the game had been five minutes longer Soccer Saturday verdict - Phil Thompson The Norwich players will be looking around the dressing room feeling like that was a defeat. It hadn't been a great match early on, and Norwich scored with their first shot on target. Ten minutes after scoring the first, they go 2-0 up. West Ham weren't in it. As soon as West Ham scored, the game changed. You could see the confidence just drain out of Norwich. It was all West Ham after it. If this game would have gone on another five minutes, there was only going to be one winner. Norwich have good players, but there is a lack of ability to sense danger.

The Irishman converted from Steven Davis' cross from the right, although Swans keeper Lukasz Fabianski may feel he could have done better. The goal was enough to give Southampton a fifth win in six games as they kept a sixth clean sheet in a row. Southampton are up to sixth, just a point behind Manchester United, while Swansea will continue to look nervously over their shoulders in the battle to avoid the drop. There was little to choose between the sides in a first half largely devoid of incident. Southampton rose to sixth in the table thanks to a goal from Shane Long Southampton rose to sixth in the table thanks to a goal from Shane Long Graziano Pelle's volley from just inside the box was the best effort either side was able to conjure up in the opening 40 minutes. However, it was too close to Fabianski and the keeper was able to gather it with ease. Andre Ayew also saw a tame shot saved by Fraser Forster while Southampton threatened again in the 15th minute, Ashley Williams forced to make a good tackle as Oriel Romeu brought down James Ward-Prowse's cross inside the penalty area. Gylfi Sigurdsson controls the ball under pressure from Jordy Clasie However, it was not until the 44th minute that either side created a real chance of note. That came when Alberto Paloschi got his head to Jack Cork's cross and flicked it on to Gylfi Sigurdsson at the far post. The midfielder has been in good goalscoring form of late but put his left-foot volley over the bar from 10 yards on this occasion. A minute later, Southampton had an even better opportunity. Davis drove forward down the right and put in a cross that deceived the Swansea centre-backs and left Long with a free header, eight yards out. The former West Brom forward seemed surprised to see the ball reach him, though, and headed straight at Fabianski. Southampton boss Ronald Koeman hailed a great win for his side after they kept their fifth consecutive clean sheet Southampton boss Ronald Koeman hailed a great win for his side after they kept their fifth consecutive clean sheet The visitors slowly took the upper hand as the second period progressed, Romeu unable to make a solid connection from Ryan Bertrand's cross while they also saw Pelle's close range strike chalked off for a foul on Fabinaski. Swansea had their moments though and almost went in front as Sigurdsson's curled in a superb free-kick from which Williams just failed to get the required contact to head past Forster. Swansea boss Francesco Guidolin admitted his side did not play well for the first time under his leadership Swansea boss Francesco Guidolin admitted his side did not play well for the first time under his leadership The deadlock was broken five minutes later though as Long atoned for his earlier miss. Substitute Cedric Soares laid the ball off to Davis and again the midfielder's cross found Long unmarked. This time though Long found his mark, heading down past Fabianski from close range - although the former Arsenal stopper may feel he could have done better as the ball squirmed past him and into the far corner. Ryan Bertrand and the Southampton defence were rarely troubled at Swansea Francesco Guidolin's side pushed for an equaliser in the 20 minutes that remained but Virgil van Dijk and Jose Fonte were on hand to clear time and again as crosses came in. They could even have added a second late on, Fabianski pushing away Charlie Austin's deflected strike following a swift break. Indeed, other than a half-hearted penalty appeal as Paloschi collided with Maya Yoshida, Southampton were never unduly worried as they saw the game out to complete another shutout. Charlie Nicholas says Swansea lack aggression in midfield and danger in the wide areas, which might mean a difficult end to the season for Swans fans Charlie Nicholas says Swansea lack aggression in midfield and danger in the wide areas, which might mean a difficult end to the season for Swans fans Soccer Saturday verdict - Charlie Nicholas Swansea have real problems. Two shots on target from 13 attempts is not good enough. Southampton weren't great, but they handled the match better. Forster wasn't really troubled at all. He didn't even need to come for crosses. He let his defenders get on with it. I don't know what has happened to Ayew and Sigurdsson, Routledge didn't do much. Swansea cannot afford to go into the bottom three, this is not a fighting side. In midfield there is no aggression. The days of Laudrup where it was all pass and move are long gone. Too much comes through the middle. Southampton tend to be efficient.

Diego Costa wore a mask after breaking his nose in training They fell behind after just five minutes as Willian slipped a pass through the defence for Costa, who got goalside of Steven Taylor and slid a shot past Rob Elliott. The lead was doubled shortly afterwards as Pedro pounced on Aarons' underhit pass just inside his own half and raced clear before finishing from the edge of the box. It got even worse for the visitors after 17 minutes as Costa, wearing a mask after breaking his nose in training, outpaced Fabricio Coloccini and fed a pass through for Willian to make it 3-0. Pedro celebrates scoring Chelsea's fourth goal Branislav Ivanovic then had a shot blocked before Pedro saw a shot saved by Elliot after Jonjo Shelvey gifted the ball to Costa. Newcastle's only chance of the first half came in the 35th minute when Georginio Wijnaldum shot at Thibaut Courtois from Daryl Janmaat's cross. But Chelsea were dominant and the only negative for the hosts was seeing Terry limp off with injury. Chelsea interim manager Guus Hiddink thinks the quick start against Newcastle helped them to a convincing win at Stamford Bridge Chelsea interim manager Guus Hiddink thinks the quick start against Newcastle helped them to a convincing win at Stamford Bridge Newcastle did threaten after the break as Cahill blocked from Shelvey and Aleksandar Mitrovic fired across goal. But any faint hopes of a comeback were snuffed out on the hour mark as Pedro chested down Cesc Fabregas' pass over the top and slotted past Elliot. Steve McClaren thinks Newcastle were out of the game against Chelsea within 20 minutes Steve McClaren thinks Newcastle were out of the game against Chelsea within 20 minutes Chelsea never looked like letting Newcastle back into the match and they added a fourth when Traore finished from Azpilicueta's cross. Hazard contrived to miss from close range after a pass from Fabregas, before Townsend struck late on with a fine strike from the edge of the box.

In an open first half, Chelsea thought they should have had a penalty when John Terry, playing in his first home game since claiming Chelsea will not renew his contract when it expires at the end of the season, had a shot blocked by the arm of Daley Blind, but referee Michael Oliver waved away the Chelsea protests. Chelsea lost defender Kurt Zouma in the 59th minute to a nasty looking leg injury and just two minutes later, Jesse Lingard looked to have sealed all three points for the visitors in the 61st minute. But Costa, playing for the first time in his career against United, fired a 91st-minute equaliser.

Chelsea finally burst into life with two chances in as many minutes as Oscar fired over the bar before Willian fired a testing low cross into the box which the Brazilian midfielder was inches away from putting in the back of the net. John Terry says there has been no recent dialogue with Chelsea about a new deal John Terry says there has been no recent dialogue with Chelsea about a new deal United went back on the attack just before the break as Marouane Fellaini headed wide and Matteo Darmian's cross eluded everyone in a red shirt, but the best chance of the half fell to the hosts and Terry. In stoppage time, the centre-back's shot hit Blind's arm at close range but referee Michael Oliver decided against giving a penalty amid the Chelsea protests. In what was a lively start to the second half, Zouma thrashed a long-range effort over the bar before Wayne Rooney's curling effort from 25 yards forced Courtois into action low down at his near post. Chelsea wanted a penalty when the ball struck Daley Blind's arm Just like at the start of the first half, United were the dominant side in the early stages of the second 45 minutes with Martial again allowed to cut in from the left, but this time the Frenchman screwed his shot wide. Courtois was called into action again in the 53rd minute, diving to his left to keep out a shot from Lingard from the edge of the box. Hiddink reacted by bringing on Eden Hazard for Oscar and he was forced into another change when Zouma, who was replaced by Gary Cahill, went up for a header but landed awkwardly with his knee buckling underneath him. Kurt Zouma is treated after injuring his knee in the second half Minutes later United were ahead when Lingard, who had his back to goal, controlled Cameron Borthwick-Jackson's cross from the left before turning and striking the ball into the corner and past the dive of Courtois. With just over 20 minutes remaining, Hiddink made his final change with Pedro replacing Nemanja Matic as the hosts searched for an equaliser.

Costa headed over the bar from close range in the closing stages but it did not prove too costly as he made amends in the dying stages, taking advantage of a slip in the United defence to tap into an empty net. With six minutes of additional time, Costa had one final chance to win it but he was expertly denied by De Gea as Chelsea recorded their fourth straight home draw in the league, but extended their unbeaten run against United to 10 games in all competitions.

With 3,000 Foxes fans at the Etihad Stadium blaring out \"we're going to win the league\" their side put on a footballing masterclass against a team that are one spot behind them in the table, with a Robert Huth double and a fine Riyad Mahrez goal doing the damage. Sergio Aguero grabbed a late consolation for the hosts. In one of the most remarkable rises in English football history, Leicester City have gone from bottom of the league this time 12 months ago to being just 13 games away from becoming champions. Manchester City have not beaten any side currently in the top six of the Premier League table this season as frailties in their back-line were once again miserably exposed, this time by the scintillating Foxes attack. With this game being dubbed one of Leicester's most important of the season in terms of their title challenge - would Claudio Ranieri switch to a more conservative style? Robert Huth (middle) opened the scoring inside three minutes The answer was a comprehensive no as the fantastic Foxes started with no fear, throwing men forward with sensational energy and high quality. They were ahead inside three minutes. Manchester City's players might as well have still been in the dressing room. Mahrez flew down the right flank, speeding away from Aleksandar Kolarov to draw a cynical foul right on the byline. Mahrez picked himself up and fired a low set-piece that was turned home by Huth, who had escaped the clutches of Martin Demichelis inside the six-yard box. Huth celebrates his second goal at the Etihad The early goal could have triggered the bus to be parked - instead, Leicester revved up the engine and went for City's throat. Jamie Vardy raced onto a long ball over the City defence on nine minutes but Joe Hart was quick off his line and the striker's attempt to lob the ball over him from 10 yards out was blocked away. Danny Drinkwater was the next man in a black shirt to break past the static City back four but his low cross was spooned away by Hart. Manchester City struggled to break down Leicester despite a lot of possession The same space in behind Pablo Zabaleta was exposed again minutes later as Vardy raced clear and his strike partner Shinji Okazaki was inches away from turning home a low cross from close range. The tide started to turn slightly after that chance as Leicester's relentless opening to the match started to take its toll. However, City struggled to create a clear-cut chance despite dominating possession and winning seven corners in the opening 45 minutes. Mahrez celebrates after his goal Zabaleta had a penalty claim turned down on 25 minutes when Christian Fuchs took him out right on the edge of the penalty area but a free-kick was awarded instead. After going off to a smattering of boos, the home fans would have expected a reaction from their players - instead, it was Leicester that came out like the Red Arrows. Within three minutes of the restart it was 2-0. Mahrez put Leicester 2-0 up with a fine solo goal N'Golo Kante, who was inspirational in midfield, skipped past two challenges and fed Mahrez just outside the area. He danced past a flat-footed Demichelis with a quick-fire stepover before firing into the top corner - his 14th league goal of the season. All title-winning sides need a quality goalkeeper and Kasper Schmeichel showed his worth to this team on 55 minutes with a superb stop to deny Fernando, who had just replaced City captain Yaya Toure. The away end rose to their feet to salute their goalkeeper and five minutes later they were out of their seats again as their team took a sensational three-goal lead. Leicester boss Claudio Ranieri refused to accept his team were now title favourites Leicester boss Claudio Ranieri refused to accept his team were now title favourites Fuchs' corner to the penalty spot found Huth, who rose above two City defenders to head superbly into the top-left corner. Aguero found space to head home from a Nicolas Otamendi cross with two minutes left, and City very nearly grabbed another a minute later. Danny Simpson's short back-pass found its way to Aguero, but having been forced away from goal, the Argentine could only poke the ball wide of Schmeichel's right-hand post, before Leicester saw out injury time like potential champions. They couldn't, could they?

Lescott celebrates scoring for Aston Villa against Norwich Aston Villa kept their hopes of Premier League survival alive with a hard-fought 2-0 win over Norwich at Villa Park. Remi Garde's side started Saturday's game 10 points behind their opponents, who sat just above the relegation zone, but goals from Joleon Lescott and Gabriel Agbonlahor helped them close the gap on the Canaries and nearest rivals Sunderland. The 2-0 defeat also condemned Norwich to their fifth straight Premier League loss, and Alex Neil will be disappointed with the result after dominating for spells throughout the match. It means his side drop into the relegation places, a point behind Newcastle. Norwich manager Alex Neil was disappointed to lose against Aston Villa and believes gifted goals cost his side Norwich manager Alex Neil was disappointed to lose against Aston Villa and believes gifted goals cost his side It was Villa who enjoyed more of the ball in the opening 10 minutes and they had an early chance to go in front when Agbonlahor got on the end of Leandro Bacuna's low shot from the right, but he could not sort his feet quickly enough and sent his effort wide from 12 yards. The away side then began to dominate proceedings, with the front pairing of Dieumerci Mbokani and Steven Naismith combining well to cause the Villa defence problems, with the former forcing Mark Bunn into a good save from 25 yards. Youssouf Mulumbu of Norwich City and Idrissa Gueye of Aston Villa compete for the ball Naismith was up next, but he dragged his effort from distance just wide as the visitors pushed for an opener. Indeed, they should have taken the lead on the half-hour mark when Sebastien Bassong met Robbie Brady's cross but he headed down into the ground and sent the ball over the bar. Joleon Lescott celebrates putting Aston Villa ahead Villa weathered that storm and managed to grab the opener on the stroke of half time. Carles Gil's free-kick to the back post was not dealt with by Norwich and Lescott shook off the attention of Mbokani to head past Declan Rudd, albeit with the help of a deflection off of Timm Klose. The home side appeared buoyed by that goal and started the second period with plenty of purpose. Remi Garde was pleased to see his side come out 2-0 winners against Norwich and believes his players deserve the victory Remi Garde was pleased to see his side come out 2-0 winners against Norwich and believes his players deserve the victory Agbonlahor threatened when Norwich seemed to switch off, driving unopposed towards the box and forcing Rudd into a decent save. However, six minutes into the second half, the Villa forward did get his goal. He did well to stay onside before getting on the end of Jordan Veretout's through ball on the left-hand side of the box but he was helped by Rudd, who came rushing from his goal when he did not need to, allowing Agbonlahor to just clip the ball round the goalkeeper. Dieumerci Mbokani of Norwich City is tackled by Joleon Lescott of Aston Villa Villa nearly sealed the points five minutes later but Bacuna volleyed wide from Aly Cissokho's cross to the back post. Norwich started to search desperately for the goal that would get them back into the game, with Gary O'Neil squandering a great chance in the box before Patrick Bamford just missed out on getting on the end of Nathan Redmond's delivery. Villa had another opportunity to make the game safe with 20 minutes remaining when Veretout picked out Bacuna in the box but he blazed over the bar after getting the better of his marker. Gabriel Agbonlahor scores for Aston Villa against Norwich Norwich could have been forgiven for sensing that it was not going to be their afternoon when they had two chances cleared off the line in quick succession. First Bunn went walkabout from his goal line, failing to deal with a lofted ball to the back post and Russell Martin's header was cleared by Jores Okore. From the corner, Mbokani's header was blocked by Gil. The tension around the ground was obvious as Villa chased their third league win of the season and they were living dangerously as the clock ticked down. Idrissa Gueye of Aston Villa controls the ball under pressure of Nathan Redmond of Norwich City Mbokani had another effort cleared off the line by Lescott before his follow-up was blocked by a combination of Villa defenders and Bunn, who scrambled to meet the Norwich striker. Okore was excellent at the back for Villa and he capped a fine performance with another goal-saving block, this time denying Bamford from close range when it looked as though the on-loan striker had scored in time added on.

"report": "Aleksandar Mitrovic celebrates his goal Newcastle climbed out of the relegation zone as Aleksandar Mitrovic's first-half goal secured a 1-0 home win over West Brom on Saturday. The Magpies striker slotted home Jonjo Shelvey's measured pass (32), quietening the home fans' frustrations after Cheick Tiote's low strike was controversially ruled out for offside two minutes before in the Premier League clash at St James' Park. West Brom failed to test Rob Elliot and substitute Salomon Rondon wasted a golden opportunity in stoppage time, but the forward's pass to an unmarked Saido Berahino was behind the striker. Mitrovic in action for Newcastle A first win in three games combined with Aston Villa's victory over Norwich means Newcastle move up to 17th in the table, while the Baggies remain 14th, six points above the relegation zone. Steve McClaren made four changes from the defeat to Everton, and the home side enjoyed 77 per cent of possession in a one-sided first half. The impressive Shelvey tested Ben Foster from range, and the West Brom goalkeeper brilliantly denied Mitrovic with a reflex stop as the Magpies started the game on top. Jonjo Shelvey's assist for Aleksandar Mitrovic gave Newcastle a 1-0 victory over West Brom Jonjo Shelvey's assist for Aleksandar Mitrovic gave Newcastle a 1-0 victory over West Brom Mitrovic and Georginio Wijnaldum were caught on their heels when Moussa Sissoko's low cross along the six-yard box required a simple tap-in, leaving McClaren visibly frustrated on the sideline. Mitrovic did give his side the lead on 32 minutes, but only after a moment of controversy involving the Serb as Tiote's long-range strike was ruled out with the striker in an offside position. Tiote's shot wrong-footed Foster but the 'keeper felt Mitrovic, clearly standing ahead of the play, interfered with his line of sight, and referee Lee Mason agreed, disallowing the goal after a conversation with his assistant. Newcastle boss Steve McClaren praised his side's performance and says that he hopes that has set a benchmark for the rest of the season Newcastle boss Steve McClaren praised his side's performance and says that he hopes that has set a benchmark for the rest of the season Two minutes later, Mitrovic put the Magpies in front with his fifth league goal of the season, latching on to Shelvey's pass to slide underneath the onrushing Foster. Craig Gardner wasted a free kick on the edge of the box before carving out the visitors' best chance of the first half, but Daryl Janmaat superbly deflected James McClean's effort over the bar. Tony Pulis introduced Berahino, who was the subject of a bid from the Magpies in the transfer window, and Alex Pritchard at the break, but the momentum stayed with the home side. Referee Lee Mason (right) talks to his assistant about Cheick Tiote's disallowed goal Wijnaldum squandered a free header after Andros Townsend's cross picked out the forward, before Townsend hit the post himself with a low effort that had Foster beaten. Newcastle continued to lay siege to the West Brom goal, and only wayward finishing from Sissoko prevented McClaren's side from adding to their lead with 20 minutes to play. But their failure to make the game safe nearly came back to haunt the Magpies as Pulis threw on Rondon in the final stages, and the Baggies nearly carved out an unlikely leveller. Tony Pulis says that was the worst away display he's been in charge of since taking over at West Brom Tony Pulis says that was the worst away display he's been in charge of since taking over at West Brom Pritchard went close with a free kick from 30 yards, while another low centre by McClean caused chaos in the Newcastle box with no West Brom striker on hand to finish. They saved their best opportunity for last but Rondon failed to pick out Berahino deep into five minutes of stoppage time, allowing Janmaat to scramble clear as Newcastle earned their first clean sheet in 10 league games. The defeat means West Brom, without a win in their last seven league games on their travels, have now averaged less than a goal a game under Pulis, and they face Peterborough in their FA Cup replay on Wednesday night. Newcastle travel to Stamford Bridge next weekend boosted by impressive performances from their January signings as both Townsend and Shelvey earned standing ovations in the closing minutes. Steven Taylor celebrates at the final whistle Phil Thompson - Soccer Saturday reaction Everything about this side was great, I could go on to talk about West Brom and their deficiencies, but I think everything about this Newcastle team was just terrific, and all that was missing was more goals. Phil Thompson shares his thoughts on Newcastle's win over West Brom Phil Thompson shares his thoughts on Newcastle's win over West Brom Everybody was an eight out of 10 today. You wouldn't have thought they'd be in problems except maybe for West Brom because of how poor they were. There's not one of those players, apart from maybe [Ben] Foster, who did anything to enhance West Brom's reputation. I don't think they had one shot on target, even with set plays normally you think they could get something but nothing. Shocking and dreadful.

celebrates Everton's second goal against Stoke Everton moved back into the top half of the Premier League following a dominant 3-0 victory at Stoke. Roberto Martinez's side, who extended their unbeaten away run in the league to seven matches, were handed the perfect start at the Britannia Stadium on Saturday when Tom Cleverley was brought down in the penalty area by Jack Butland, allowing Romelu Lukaku to score his 16th league goal of the season. Romelu Lukaku, Seamus Coleman and Aaron Lennon gave Everton back-to-back 3-0 wins Romelu Lukaku, Seamus Coleman and Aaron Lennon gave Everton back-to-back 3-0 wins The visitors were out of sight by the break thanks to goals from Seamus Coleman and Aaron Lennon as Everton, who move above Stoke and into eighth, recorded back-to-back league victories for the first time this season. Stoke, who handed club record signing Giannelli Imbula a debut, suffered a third straight 3-0 defeat in the league as Mark Hughes' side dropped down to 11th. Mark Hughes says his Stoke side weren't good enough against Everton Mark Hughes says his Stoke side weren't good enough against Everton Everton, who were unchanged from the midweek win against Newcastle, were in front in the 11th minute after Butland brought down Cleverley to give away a penalty. Lukaku made no mistake from the spot, scoring his 20th goal in all competitions to become the first Everton player to score 20 or more goals in consecutive seasons since Graeme Sharp achieved the feat in the 1984-85 and 1985-86 seasons. Romelu Lukaku fires home his 20th goal of the season from the penalty spot The visitors' lead was doubled in the 28th minute when Coleman ran across Erik Pieters and Marc Muniesa to head Cleverley's corner across Butland and into the far corner. Not a lot was coming back from Stoke and their afternoon was about to get even worse when Philipp Wollscheid clipped a blind pass into the path of Lennon, who raced through on goal before firing a low shot past Butland and into the bottom corner. Coleman leaps to head home Tom Cleverley's corner The boos rang around the Britannia at the sound of referee Andre Marriner's whistle and it served to give Stoke renewed intent at the start of the second half as Ibrahim Afellay combined with Xherdan Shaqiri, only to see his shot blocked by Bryan Oviedo. However, it was not long until Everton were back on the front foot through the impressive Ross Barkley, but he could only find the side netting with his shot after collecting a pass from Lukaku. Aaron Lennon celebrates Everton's third goal Everton went close to a fourth just before the hour mark and Barkley was involved again, crossing for Lukaku but his header was superbly tipped onto the bar by Butland. Hughes brought on Peter Odemwingie and Stephen Ireland in place of Shaqiri and Afellay but it was Everton who finished the stronger of the sides with Lennon bursting past Wollscheid and Pieters before finding Lukaku in front of goal, but the striker was denied in quick succession by a Marc Muniesa block and another fine Butland save. Mark Hughes' Stoke are without a win in four league games And after James McCarthy fired a powerful shot just wide of his goal, Butland - watched from the stands by his England boss Roy Hodgson - was called into action again, keeping out an effort from substitute Arouna Kone, who made his 50th Everton appearance. Another impressive Butland performance would have been little consolation to Stoke manager Hughes, who saw his side draw a fourth consecutive blank in front of goal and extend their run without a league win to four games. Paul Merson - Soccer Saturday Verdict Today, everything clicked. I thought Everton were absolutely outstanding, from goalkeeper to Romelu Lukaku up front. They were good. Whatever Roberto Martinez says won't be over the top at all. They can say whatever they want, he can say whatever he wants. Roy Hodgson is sitting there and thinking 'wow'. Lennon was good, he's a forgotten man but he took players on and Barkley was unbelievable. Hodgson will be looking on the other end and if we do meet Belgium and Lukaku's up front, he was an absolute handful again. When he left Chelsea, it was probably the right decision [by the club]. Sitting here, it was probably the worst decision they've made. Stoke have lost their last three league games 3-0. The crowd were booing straight after the game. [Xherdan] Shaqiri got brought off, they booed. The fans weren't happy. They've had a terrible two weeks, gone out of both cups then lost 3-0. The £18m player [Giannelli Imbula] needs to understand what the Premier League is all about because today Gareth Barry and James McCarthy completely bossed it.

Crystal Palace defender Scott Dann said that his side had to dig in to secure a point Crystal Palace defender Scott Dann said that his side had to dig in to secure a point Dann also netted in Palace's defeat against Bournemouth on Tuesday night, but this time his goal brought Alan Pardew's side their first point of 2016. Swansea, meanwhile, continued their unbeaten start to life under Francesco Guidolin, who has drawn his last two games since victory at Everton a fortnight ago. Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew was happy to have secured his first point of the new year Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew was happy to have secured his first point of the new year The home side started brighter and they took a deserved lead in the 13th minute through Sigurdsson's brilliant free-kick. The Icelandic midfielder won the set-piece himself after being fouled by Emmanuel Adebayor on the edge of the area, before curling one into Wayne Hennessey's bottom left-hand corner. Guidolin's side continued to dominate and Alberto Paloschi, making his full debut for Swansea, impressed as a lone striker, providing a useful outlet for his side as well as linking up well with Sigurdsson and Wayne Routledge in attack. Gylfi Sigurdsson (second left) of Swansea City scores his team's first goal Palace were struggling to make an impact, with Adebayor looking isolated up front on his first start for the club, but they grew into it towards the end of the half and had chances to equalise just before the break. Adebayor had an effort deflected just over, while Yohan Cabaye's long-range strike and Dann's header from a free-kick also went close. Sigurdsson (left) celebrates scoring his team's first goal Pardew made a change at half-time as Marouane Chamakh replaced the ineffective Lee Chung-yong and joined Adebayor up front, and the attacking change paid immediate dividends as they equalised in the 47th minute. Damien Delaney headed Cabaye's corner into the path of Dann, who made no mistake in firing home from close range. Emmanuel Adebayor and Ashley Williams (right) tangle Both sides pushed hard for the rest of the game to find the winner, with Sigurdsson's set-pieces in particular causing real problems for the Palace defence as both Swansea's centre-backs - Federico Fernandez and Ashley Williams - went close. But in the end neither side could find a second goal as the spoils were eventually shared at the Liberty Stadium - as Swansea stay 16th and Palace remain in 12th. Crystal Palace forward Emmanuel Adebayor says he is happy to be playing regular football again Crystal Palace forward Emmanuel Adebayor says he is happy to be playing regular football again Charlie Nicholas' Soccer Saturday verdict Swansea look just a little bit more confident when they have the ball. They've always been fairly comfortable on that side of things. Guidolin is into his technical ideas isn't he and they pass it and move it, the wet conditions probably helped that. It was a good start, they wanted to make things happen. The Sigurdsson free-kick is a very clever one. I was impressed with how Palace got back into the game. Adebayor was lively, he led the line well. But [Wilfried] Zaha was too deep in the first half, [Yohan] Cabaye was too deep and then the start of the second half [Marouane] Chamakh came on and it sprung them into life then straight away Scott Dann scores, a lovely finish. A little touch on near post, steers it really well and it's nothing more than they deserved.

winning goal for Tottenham Kieran Trippier's second-half goal was enough to give Tottenham their sixth win in six games as they moved up to second in the Premier League with a 1-0 victory at home to Watford. The full-back tapped in from close range from Dele Alli's cross in the 64th minute at White Hart Lane on Saturday and that goal proved enough to earn the hosts all three points. Watford rarely threatened as Mauricio Pochettino's side dominated from start to finish, the victory taking them above Manchester City in the league standings, five points behind leaders Leicester. The hosts were quickly onto the front foot and rarely let Watford out of their own half in the opening 45 minutes. Tottenham secured their fourth Premier League win in a row with a 1-0 victory over Watford Tottenham secured their fourth Premier League win in a row with a 1-0 victory over Watford Their first opportunity of note came after nine minutes when Harry Kane got onto a ball over the top but was unable to get the power on his shot to beat Heurelho Gomes under a challenge from Nathan Ake, the referee waving away his hopeful claims for a penalty. For all their possession, it took until the half-hour mark before Spurs really threatened the Watford goal again - a nice move ending with Christian Eriksen slipping in full-back Ben Davies, only for his effort to deflect off Allan Nyom and into the side-netting. Harry Kane and Nathan Ake (right) compete for the ball Davies was in again soon after, combining well with Nacer Chadli before seeing his shot saved by Gomes, low down to his left. Watford's best effort came courtesy of a huge kick from Gomes. A gust of wind carried the ball from one end of the pitch to the other and caused confusion in the Spurs defence. Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino praised the fans for their help Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino praised the fans for their help Tripper came round to deal with it ahead of Odion Ighalo but presented the ball straight to Almen Abdi, whose chipped effort landed on the roof of the net with Hugo Lloris stranded. Perhaps the best chance of the half though, came five minutes before the break as Eric Dier clipped a superb pass over the Hornets backline for Kane, six yards out. However, the England striker could only volley it over the bar as the ball dropped over the defender's shoulder. Troy Deeney (right) was brought on at half-time Watford made two changes at the break as captain Troy Deeney, who had not been risked from the start after complaining of a tight hamstring, entered the fray alongside Valon Behrami. However, it was the home side who came flying out of the traps again in the second period and in one of their early ventures into Watford territory, Chadli collided with Miguel Britos. The defender came off worse and despite initially playing on, had to be replaced nine minutes into the second half, using up Quique Sanchez Flores' final substitution. By that stage, Spurs had already had a penalty appeal turned down as Gomes appeared to clip Kane, while the Spurs striker had also miscontrolled when well placed in the penalty area. Watford manager Quique Sanchez Flores says Tottenham could now go all the way and win the Premier League Watford manager Quique Sanchez Flores says Tottenham could now go all the way and win the Premier League Alli was introduced just past the hour and it took him just three minutes to make an impact. Kane flicked the ball on for Mousa Dembele as Spurs broke, the midfielder held up the ball well before feeding Alli who burst to the byline before playing the ball across the face of goal with the outside of his right foot to leave Trippier with a tap in to claim his first goal for the club. It could have been 2-0 when Eriksen slipped in Erik Lamela but the Argentine sliced the ball wide with his weaker right foot. Trippier scored the only goal at White Hart Lane Watford were attempting to show more in attack but with little success and Gomes remained the busier of the goalkeepers, pushing away Eriksen's shot from a tight angle and parrying a strong effort from Heung-Min Son. The visitors' best chance came when Etienne Capoue played a ball over the top for Deeney. However, the Watford skipper lacked the pace to get away from Kevin Wimmer and eventually teed up Ighalo, whose shot was deflected behind. Spurs saw out the rest of the game with relative ease and now head into next week's Super Sunday clash at the Etihad Stadium ahead of Manuel Pellegrini's side, who lost at home to Leicester earlier in the day.

In fairness, Newcastle had goalkeeper Rob Elliot to thank for keeping them in the game as a string of fine saves in the second half prevented Everton from running amok.

Steve McClaren says Newcastle's performance at Everton was unacceptable Steve McClaren says Newcastle's performance at Everton was unacceptable It was a night for new faces on Merseyside as both teams unveiled January recruits, with Townsend handed his first start for Newcastle after moving from Tottenham, while Everton's Deadline Day signing Oumar Niasse carried out a watching brief from the stands. Tom Cleverley came close to an early breakthrough but Elliot was on hand to paw his fifth-minute strike out, before Romelu Lukaku, having beaten the Toon stopper, sent a free-kick agonisingly over the target on 22 minutes. Aaron Lennon says the Everton players' hard work in training paid off Aaron Lennon says the Everton players' hard work in training paid off Everton's early dominance, and patience, soon told as Lennon's quick swivel and shot wrong-footed Elliot and trickled in to give the hosts a deserved lead. Seamus Coleman's neat cut back just before half-time looked to have set up Lennon for his second, but Chancel Mbemba's last-ditch intervention ensured the Magpies entered the interval trailing by just the single goal. Ross Barkley celebrates after scoring his team's third goal It proved to be Mbemba's last contribution as he left the field having picked up an injury, while Lukaku came off at half-time for Arouna Kone with a suspected back problem. However, despite losing their leading striker, Everton continued to bombard the Newcastle goal, with Lennon again presented with a chance to double his tally, only for Elliot to deny him with his feet on 51 minutes, before Kone spurned the rebound. Elliot was in inspired form, singlehandedly keeping Everton at bay. First he produced a fine save to tip Barkley's goal-bound effort onto the crossbar and then prevented Jonjo Shelvey's header from looping in shortly before the hour. Paul Dummett of Newcastle shoots at goal Cleverley's near-post free-kick was then turned onto the post by Elliot and Newcastle looked to punish the hosts' profligacy when substitute Aleksandar Mitrovic failed to turn Moussa Sissoko's cross home on 66 minutes. Everton soon wrestled back control and looked set to see out the game until Barkley made the result safe with an 88th-minute penalty after substitute Rolando Aarons brought down Lennon.

Odion Ighalo had the best chance for the hosts, miscuing a close-range header in the first half, while former Tottenham goalkeeper Gomes was at his best to keep out Diego Costa's late header, Chelsea's clearest opening. The result means Chelsea are unbeaten in 10 games in all competitions, their best run since the 2014/15 season, while Watford move up to ninth, four points ahead of the Blues. Mike Dean (left) talks with Costa (right) and Oscar in the first half John Terry, who announced on Sunday he would be leaving Chelsea at the end of the season, was named as captain at the heart of the Blues defence for the 11th straight game, while Watford's new signing Mario Suarez started on the bench for the hosts. The first chance of the game fell to Watford after an even opening as Jose Holebas' cross from the left found its way onto the head of Ighalo six yards out, but the striker failed to make proper contact after rising too early. Moments later, Etienne Capoue stung the hands of Thibaut Courtois from 15 yards after Jose Manuel Jurado had dodged two Chelsea men on the edge of the area to feed him. Troy Deeney and Cesar Azpilicueta compete for a header Costa and Juan Carlos Paredes both went into the book just before the break after a clash in front of the Hornets bench. The Chelsea striker reacted to Paredes' initial challenge but the pair were quickly separated as manager Quique Sanchez Flores and Ighalo played peacemakers. Etienne Capoue confronts Costa after the Chelsea forward had clashed with Juan Carlos Paredes After the interval, Holebas hit the side-netting from the left angle after a fine one-two with Capoue, moments after Troy Deeney had driven the ball a couple of yards wide of Courtois' post. Chelsea then came close to breaking the deadlock through Oscar, but the Brazilian's poke from close range after Costa had centred from the byline ran just wide of the left-hand post. Costa reacts after being booked by referee Dean Oscar then forced Gomes into a good save with 20 minutes remaining after his long-range effort, before Gomes was at his best again to palm away Branislav Ivanovic's drive from inside the area after Eden Hazard's cut back. And man of the match Gomes, keeping his 10th clean sheet of the season, produced a fantastic stop with three minutes remaining, diving to his right to keep out Costa's header.

Forster, who has not conceded since returning to the side against Watford, made two smart saves from Mesut Ozil in the first half, before making a series of stops from Ozil again, substitute Theo Walcott and Alexis Sanchez as Arsenal piled on the pressure after the break. Laurent Koscielny headed over from close range, while Southampton's best opportunity fell to Sadio Mane, but the Saints forward could only scuff wide after latching onto Virgil van Dijk's flick. Laurent Koscielny heads over from close range in the second half Arsenal drop to fourth following victories for title rivals Leicester City, Tottenham and Manchester City, while the draw extends Southampton's unbeaten run to four matches. Both sides were without their January signings as Arsene Wenger and Ronald Koeman each made two changes from their last league outings. Charlie Austin, ruled out with a slight knock, should return at the weekend for the Saints, while Mohamed Elneny was not included in the Arsenal squad after making his debut in the FA Cup. Saints boss Ronald Koeman was full of praise for his goalkeeper, Fraser Forster Saints boss Ronald Koeman was full of praise for his goalkeeper, Fraser Forster In an even first half the Gunners carved out the better opportunities, with Forster twice denying Ozil from point-blank range. The German international produced a sublime piece of skill to test the Southampton goalkeeper 11 minutes in, plucking a long ball out of the air with his first touch before turning it goalwards with his second, but Forster saved with an outstretched leg. Fraser Forster denies Mesut Ozil in the first half with a point-blank save His stop 10 minutes later was the pick of the bunch, though, as he instinctively kept out Ozil's jabbed finish from three yards after Giroud's header put the Arsenal attacker in on goal. Despite the opportunities for the home side it was not one-way traffic, and Southampton served warnings through Dusan Tadic and Mane. The former twisted and turned on the edge of the box before firing tamely at Petr Cech, while Mane wasted the Saints' best chance of the half, latching onto a Van Dijk header only to miscue past the post. Petr Cech says Arsenal should have won their clash against Southampton Petr Cech says Arsenal should have won their clash against Southampton The Gunners finished the half on top as Joel Campbell picked out Ozil six yards out on the stroke of half-time, but the Arsenal man was quickly crowded out by a Southampton defence looking to post its fourth consecutive shutout. Wenger's side kept the pressure on, with Forster tipping over Olivier Giroud's curling effort four minutes after the restart, and looked set to take the lead through Walcott shortly after only for the Southampton 'keeper to again stand firm. Fraser Forster denies Theo Walcott Southampton's goal continued to live a charmed life as Koscielny headed over the bar from four yards, and even when Forster was beaten, Wenger's side still failed to break the deadlock - James Ward-Prowse clearing off the line from Sanchez's low drive with 20 minutes to play. Mane and Long had opportunities on the break, with the former drawing a routine save from Cech, but the Gunners were swiftly back on the front foot as they pushed for a winner. Van Dijk denied Ozil with the Arsenal attacker poised to pull the trigger, while Forster's strong right hand denied Sanchez on the follow-up, but despite six minutes of added time, the Gunners could not find a breakthrough. Southampon's Fraser Forster praises his side's performance at the Emirates Southampon's Fraser Forster praises his side's performance at the Emirates Arsenal's 10 shots on target without a goal is the joint most in a league game this season, and the Gunners are now winless in the Premier League since victory over Newcastle a month ago. They face Bournemouth at the Vitality Stadium at the weekend, five points off top-of-the-table Leicester, while Southampton will look to keep their fifth straight clean sheet against West Ham on Saturday Night Football.

the King Power Stadium. Vardy, who is close to agreeing a new three-and-a-half year contract which could see him double his existing wages, showed what he is worth to Leicester on the hour mark, firing a stunning goal-of-the-season contender over Simon Mignolet from 25 yards. In front of England manager Roy Hodgson, Vardy doubled his side's advantage 12 minutes later with an excellent finish from close range to score his 18th Premier League goal of the season. Victory maintained Leicester's three-point gap at the top of the table as they prepare to face Manchester City and Arsenal in their next two league games. For Liverpool, defeat means Jurgen Klopp's men are 11 points adrift of the top four and six points behind Manchester United in fifth. Jamie Vardy says Leicester are not thinking further than their next game Jamie Vardy says Leicester are not thinking further than their next game Claudio Ranieri stuck with the same line-up that swept aside Stoke 3-0 last time out and his side started on the front foot again with Riyad Mahrez curling an effort from 20 yards just wide in the second minute. In the ninth minute, Vardy, who caused Liverpool's defence problems all night, burst clear down the left before delivering an inch-perfect cross for Shinji Okazaki, whose header was turned over by Mignolet. At the other end it was Kasper Schmeichel's turn to get in on the action as he palmed Emre Can's volley over the bar, however the German was correctly flagged offside. Liverpool's James Milner and Danny Drinkwater of Leicester compete for the ball Mahrez looked Leicester's biggest goal threat in the first half and in the 14th minute he plucked a high ball out of the sky, before volleying the ball straight at Mignolet. It was Mahrez against Mignolet again in the 35th minute but this time the Belgium international needed to be at the top of his game to keep the Algerian's first-time effort out, diving full stretch to tip the ball over the bar. Liverpool, who were angered by Robert Huth's stray elbow catching Adam Lallana, came close when Alberto Moreno shot over five minutes before the break - although a cross into the box seemed the better option. Jurgen Klopp thinks Vardy's 'world class' goal made the difference Jurgen Klopp thinks Vardy's 'world class' goal made the difference Liverpool had another excellent chance at the start of the second half with James Milner combining with Jordan Henderson, before Can fired a powerful shot just wide. The home side always looked a threat on the break with Vardy the Liverpool defence's chief tormentor, however, it was Schmeichel who was called into action as he clawed away Moreno's cross from his near post. Vardy wheels away after scoring the opening goal Vardy soon proved the difference and he showed his full value to Leicester on the hour as he left Dejan Lovren trailing, before smashing a bouncing ball first-time over the head of Mignolet and into the top corner from the right corner of the penalty area. There were smiles all over Hodgson's face when the cameras inside the ground panned to him but they were about to get even bigger as Vardy latched onto Okazaki's deflected shot to steer the ball past Mignolet to double his side's advantage. Jamie Vardy celebrates scoring Leicester's first goal with his team mates Klopp threw on Christian Benteke as Liverpool searched for a way back into the game but it was not their night as they fell 11 points adrift of the top four. However, for Leicester, and for Vardy, it was a night to remember as Ranieri's men proved their Premier League title credentials.

The result, which moves Spurs up to third, above bitter rivals Arsenal on goal difference, never looked in doubt right from the off as Alli gave the visitors the lead with less than two minutes on the clock. The England midfielder was again in the thick of the action on the half-hour mark as he won a penalty, which Harry Kane converted, to double Spurs' lead. Harry Kane scored twice as Tottenham beat Norwich 3-0 at Carrow Road Harry Kane scored twice as Tottenham beat Norwich 3-0 at Carrow Road Kane then completed the scoring to ensure Spurs kept their title hopes alive, while Norwich did little to alleviate their relegation fears after another meek display. Mauricio Pochettino made seven changes to the side that won so easily at Colchester at the weekend, but a new-look Spurs settled very quickly, and soon took the lead. With Norwich allowing him space to do so, Kane shifted the ball, fired at goal, Declan Rudd got down smartly in the Canaries' goal to keep it out, but Alli reacted quickest to tap home the rebound. Tottenham players celebrate their team's first goal by Dele Alli The hosts opted for the aerial route, but had limited success as Hugo Lloris was untroubled for much of the opening period. Son Hueng-min darted across his man at the near post as Spurs went in search of a second, was picked out brilliantly by Kane, but he could only flick the ball wide on the run. However, the second wasn't far away, with Alli again reacting first when Rudd had denied Kane from almost the exact same spot. This time Alli was clumsily bundled to the floor by Sebastien Bassong, leaving referee Kevin Friend little option but to give a penalty. Alli reacted quickest to break the deadlock Kane sent Rudd the wrong way as he made no mistake on the half-hour mark, before Alli almost made it three with a glancing header. The England midfielder was withdrawn at the break due to illness, and Spurs looked much less of a threat, content to sit back and allow Norwich to have possession in their own half. Steven Naismith had Norwich's best effort of the match on 51 minutes as he glanced a header just past the post, with Lloris beaten. Kane tussles with Sebastien Bassong at Carrow Road Kane should have added his second after beating the offside trap with 10 minutes to go, but he saw his powerful strike come out off the inside of the post. Nevertheless, in the 90th minute, Kane did get his second and Spurs' third from an identical position after Christian Eriksen had nicked the ball into his path, this time moving the ball onto his left foot before beating Rudd to complete the job in style.

The Argentine was in the right place at the right time to stab home the only goal of the game after just 16 minutes. That strike was enough to keep Manuel Pellegrini's side just three points behind the top-of-the-table Foxes, while the Black Cats remain four points from safety in the relegation zone after this latest loss. Boss Sam Allardyce handed defender Lamine Kone his Sunderland debut, with Jan Kirchhoff also making his first start in central midfield, although the club's two other January signings - midfielder Wahbi Khazri and striker Dame N'Doye - both started on the bench. His opposite number, Manuel Pellegrini, opted to reward Kelechi Iheanacho for his hat-trick against Aston Villa in the FA Cup fourth round on Saturday by starting the young striker, with Raheem Sterling having to settle for a place on the bench. However, the Chilean was still unable to call upon likes of Fabian Delph, Kevin De Bruyne, Vincent Kompany, Eliaquim Mangala, Wilfried Bony and Samir Nasri through injury for the trip to Wearside. And it did not take long for the visitors to make the breakthrough as Aguero continued his recent good form in front of goal by scoring his 18th goal of the season, and his sixth in his last four games for the club. Manuel Pellegrini says he's fully focused on his remaining time at Manchester City Manuel Pellegrini says he's fully focused on his remaining time at Manchester City Spain winger Jesus Navas drove a rather hopeful cross cum shot across the Sunderland penalty area, with the ball falling nicely at the feet of the deadly striker, who made no mistake with a toe-poked finish from close range past a helpless Vito Mannone. But if that early strike was meant to calm City nerves, it actually did the opposite, with the home side going on to enjoy the best of the opening period. In fact, the Black Cats really should have been level at the break after new-boy Kone somehow headed Jeremain Lens's inch-perfect free-kick past Joe Hart's right-hand post from just eight yards out when it seemed easier to score. Joe Hart says the Manchester City squad are fully behind Manuel Pellegrini Joe Hart says the Manchester City squad are fully behind Manuel Pellegrini Meanwhile, Jermain Defoe also went close to drawing his side level, but after turning Nicolas Otamendi in the box, Hart produced a sensational one-handed save to keep out his low shot, before right-back Billy Jones struck the outside of the post from the rebound. Allardyce introduced another new signing at half-time, with Tunisia international Khazri replacing the injured Lens, and the attacking midfielder from Bordeaux turned in an eye-catching display in the second half to rouse the home team. However, despite enjoying the lion's share of possession in the second period and restricting their multimillion-pound opponents to rare forays on the break, Sunderland just could not find a way past City's inspired 'keeper. Nicolas Otamendi and Jermain Defoe compete for the ball The England international's best save though came 12 minutes from the end when diving full length to turn behind Jones' well-struck shot from outside the area. And from the resulting left-wing corner, the Black Cats were unlucky not to score when captain John O'Shea blazed over the bar from just six yards out. When Hart was finally beaten, however, Otamendi was there to clear the impressive Kirchhoff's injury-time header off the line as Sunderland pushed for a deserved equaliser that never came.

The striker was dismissed in the early stages after throwing his arm into Aaron Cresswell, before Michail Antonio headed the Hammers in front after half-time. Cheikhou Kouyate then added a second on the counter-attack as Villa pushed for a late equaliser. The result leaves Aston Villa 10 points adrift of safety at the foot of the table while West Ham stay in sixth, six points off the top four. Michail Antonio of celebrates scoring his team's first goal Micah Richards nearly scored an own goal inside two minutes when Dimitri Payet's cross deflected off the Villa defender and just wide of the post, but after that it was the away side who emerged brighter in the early stages. That was until Ayew's entirely unnecessary red card after 17 minutes. The striker inexplicably decided to swing his elbow into the face of Cresswell, even though the West Ham left-back was doing very little to antagonize him, and the ball was halfway up the pitch. Referee Jon Moss wasted no time in brandishing his red card, and boss Remi Garde wouldn't even look at him as he trudged off the pitch and down the tunnel. Aston Villa's Leandro Bacuna chases the ball against West Ham United The game then became something of a training exercise for West Ham, but they lacked their usual zip going forward and only Enner Valencia came close to scoring before half-time. Right-back James Tomkins fired a cross-shot right into the path of the West Ham striker, but his header from six yards flew over when it looked like it would have been easier to find the back of the net. Slaven Bilic must have got stuck into his players at the interval, because the Hammers emerged for the second-half looking far brighter, and it took just 13 minutes for them to find the lead via Antonio. Mark Noble picked the ball up just inside Villa's half, before pinging a lovely pass over the top of the away defence right onto the head of his team-mate, and Antonio used all the power in his neck muscles to head it past Mark Bunn while on the move. Micah Richards of Aston Villa and Mark Noble of West Ham United The goal absolutely flattened Villa after they had worked so hard to stay on level terms, with Richards in particular doing all he could to keep his side in with a chance. But, with confidence already so low, there never looked like there was going to be a way back from there. West Ham dominated the rest of the game and finally sealed the result with five minutes left to go, breaking away from a Villa corner before Valencia played it through for Kouyate in the box, and he made no mistake with the finish to send the home fans into raptures.

scoring Bournemouth's winner against Crystal Palace. Benik Afobe's third goal in three games condemned Crystal Palace to a fifth successive Premier League defeat on Tuesday as Bournemouth picked up a 2-1 win at Selhurst Park. The former Wolves man has thrived since his move from the Championship and added another goal to his tally when he netted a rebound from Matt Ritchie's shot to seal the points for the visitors. Crystal Palace certainly saw the better of the chances throughout the game but lacked the cutting edge to nick a point despite taking the lead through Scott Dann just before the half-hour mark. Their lead didn't last long though as Marc Pugh equalised seven minutes later and Afobe pounced in the second half to give Bournemouth another away win and condemn the hosts to their worst Premier League run since 2013. It leaves the Eagles still stuck on 31 points with Bournemouth closing in behind them - now on 28 points and seven clear of the relegation zone. Crystal Palace's Joel Ward and Bournemouth's Marc Pugh battle for the ball during the game at Selhurst Park. Crystal Palace started the game strongly and could have had a goal inside the opening three minutes, with Joel Ward whipping in a ball from the right, but Harry Arter was there to see it out for a corner. Chung-Yong Lee had a chance from the resulting set-piece, but his effort from just outside the box went high and wide of the bar. Free-kicks came thick and fast in an opening 45 minutes that was littered with fouls, the best of them coming for Bournemouth ten minutes later. James McArthur fouled on Dan Gosling right on the edge of the box, with Arter providing a delightful flick on in the build-up. Marc Pugh celebrates scoring Bournemouth's first goal of the game The Bournemouth contingent standing over the set-piece complained about the Palace wall, but when it was eventually taken by Matt Ritchie, he smashed it straight into the Eagles defenders. The game was lacking a spark until the 25th minute when the visitors had their best chance of the half, with Charlie Daniels playing in a sublime ball to Afobe on the right of the box. The striker just needed to tap home with Wayne Hennessey the only man to beat but instead scuffed his shot to send it wide of the post. Bournemouth were ruing the missed opportunity two minutes later when Crystal Palace pounced to take the lead. The build-up came from a cleared corner, finding Lee on the right flank who put in a superb back-heel for Wilfried Zaha, letting the winger fire a cross into the box to find Dann, who fired past Artur Boruc to give the hosts the lead. Scott Dann celebrates scoring the opening goal of the game for Crystal Palace. But it didn't last long with Bournemouth equalising soon after, Daniels playing in another lovely cross for Pugh, who put together some fancy footwork to beat four or five Crystal Palace defenders and sent his shot flying into the bottom corner. The rest of the half passed without much incident, but plenty of flared tempers, with Arter and Zaha both confronting the officials over their decisions. Indeed, the Eagles man received a yellow card for a particularly angry rant at the referee's assistant, with McArthur and Pape Souare skying efforts in added time for the hosts The second half paid homage to the first with Mile Jedinak fouling Gosling within seconds of the restart, and the Eagles certainly starting strong once again. Alan Pardew says his Crystal Palce side lacked quality in their 2-1 home defeat to Bournemouth. Alan Pardew says his Crystal Palce side lacked quality in their 2-1 home defeat to Bournemouth. Bournemouth had to keep a strong line of defence as Jason Puncheon went on a mazy run across the back of the box, eventually playing the ball into Fraizer Campbell, who attempted the spectacular over-head kick but he wasn't able to connect. But when the visitors began to find their feet, they played some lovely passing football around the Crystal Palace box, with the ball eventually falling to Simon Francis only for him to send his shot straight into the hands of Hennessey. The Cherries managed to capitalise on their spell of pressure as Afobe netted the winner just before the hour mark and making it three goals in three games for his new side. Marc Pugh leveled the game for Bournemouth before half-time. It was a fantastic save initially from Hennessey, pushing away a thunderous shot from Ritchie but Afobe was lurking to head home the rebound and put Bournemouth ahead. During the celebrations, Emmanuel Adebayor came on for his Crystal Palace debut and his first touches were greeted with cheers from the home crowd. He was involved in the action not long after, setting off a good break for the south Londoners, which ended in Lee hitting an effort towards goal but it was well saved by Boruc. The game was certainly heated, with Zaha in particular a cause of frustration for both the Bournemouth players and match officials, but continued to win his side a plethora of free kicks on the left-hand side. Emmanuel Adebayor comes on for his Crystal Palace debut, replacing Fraizer Campbell. With 15 minutes to play, another Zaha-won free kick was whipped in by Puncheon, finding the head of Adebayor who flicked the ball towards goal and it should have been finished by Marouane Chamakh from close range but his effort was somehow scrambled away. Crystal Palace once again could have had a nick at the post, with Puncheon hitting an effort through a melee of players in the box and just evading the toe of Adebayor to find the hands of Boruc. The Bournemouth stopper was called into action twice in quick succession in the final few minutes, the first a more spectacular stop. Crystal Palace mounted another attack, with Zaha playing the ball into Jedinak deep on the left flank and the captain cutting back for Chamakh. Eddie Howe singled out Benik Afobe for special praise after the former Wolves striker scored his third goal in as many games in Bournemouth's 2-1 win over Eddie Howe singled out Benik Afobe for special praise after the former Wolves striker scored his third goal in as many games in Bournemouth's 2-1 win over The striker took on the shot - again from close range - but the Cherries 'keeper was there to make a reaction save with his feet to keep his side ahead. Adebayor could have made it four out of four debut goals in second half added time, with Zaha's cross evading everyone but the striker at the far post, who hit the ball on the turn but it thrashed into the side of the net. It was a heart in mouth moment for everyone at Selhurst Park but the hosts were unable to find the breakthrough before the final whistle.

Jesse Lingard's 14th-minute header set the hosts on their way before Anthony Martial underscored United's superiority with a superb second on 23 minutes. Wayne Rooney's strike eight minutes after the interval all-but ended the game as a contest as United coasted to a timely, and morale-boosting, victory in front of an appreciative home crowd. Stoke, meanwhile, missed the chance to complete a first Premier League double over United as Mark Hughes' side, fresh consecutive cup exits, struggled to replicate the form which saw them run out convincing winners on Boxing Day. The result sees United remain fifth the Premier League, five points adrift of Arsenal in fourth and 10 behind leaders Leicester. Stoke remain ninth. Mark Hughes says a poor start to the game cost his Stoke side Mark Hughes says a poor start to the game cost his Stoke side The day before kick-off, Manchester United fans had to come to terms with the news that Pep Guardiola was set to take over as manager at Manchester City in the summer. However, immediately before the game, there was an air of reflection at Old Trafford as United marked the 58th anniversary of the Munich Air Disaster with a moving tribute. Anthony Martial of Manchester United scores his team's second goal Stoke headed into the game having suffered penalty shoot-out heartache in the Capital One Cup before being eliminated from the FA Cup, so many would have backed this game to live up to the drab affairs which have graced Old Trafford many a time this season. However, United raced out of the traps, reverting back to their fluent, attacking best to race into a commanding lead as Lingard got on the end of Cameron Borthwick-Jackson's whipped delivery to head home from close range. It should have been two shortly after as Martial rifled the ball into the side-netting from close range, but the Frenchman was not to be denied as United were two up before the 25-minute mark. Lingard (left) of Manchester United celebrates Juan Mata and Rooney combined brilliantly on the counter to set up Martial who took one touch to control before unerringly whipping the ball high past the stricken Jack Butland. That strike was the first time United had scored twice in the first half of a Premier League game at Old Trafford since April 2015. Phillippe Wollscheid joined the Potters' mounting injury list on the half-hour mark but his replacement, Phil Bardsley, did well in shoring up the visitors' backline as Ibrahim Afellay went close with two efforts before the interval. Michael Carrick was in the starting line-up for the first time since Boxing Day United then missed the chance to put the game beyond Stoke's reach when Mata inexcusably headed Matteo Darmian's cross wide from six yards. Stoke looked to make the most of their reprieve from Mata's miss and started the second half well but it was United who got the important next goal. Wayne Rooney of Manchester United celebrates Moments after having an effort disallowed for a foul on Glen Johnson, Rooney rounded off a vintage United counter, turning Martial's low cross into the back of the net on 53 minutes. And from that point on it was damage limitation for Stoke, with only United substitute Memphis Depay coming close to adding to United's commanding lead.

Saido Berahino was the talking point before the game after he was not named in Tony Pulis' starting line-up. He came off the bench moments before Sigurdsson's opener but was unable to make an impact as his strike partner proved West Brom's saviour on the night. Gylfi Sigurdsson opened the scoring for Swansea The first half saw both sides unable to offer a cutting edge in front of goal. Darren Fletcher missed two headed opportunities and a chance inside the box in the 43rd minute as they couldn't break the deadlock. Sigurdsson came closest to scoring in the opening 45 minutes after some quick thinking to try and lob Ben Foster from just inside West Brom's half nearly paid dividends, but the Baggies 'keeper was able to claw his effort away with a one-handed save. Swansea's Sung-Yueng Ki is stretchered off at the end of the first half Ki Sung-yeung was forced off on a stretcher on the stroke of half-time after Stephane Sessegnon accidentally kicked him in the face, which forced Swansea boss Guidolin to bring on new signing Alberto Paloschi. After the break, Swansea showed their intent to secure back-to-back wins on the road.

Paloschi tried to set up a one-on-one opportunity but the ball cannoned off Ashley Williams and into the path of Sigurdsson who cut in a fine low drive, from 12 yards out, into bottom the right hand corner. Saido Berahino came on for West Brom with 28 minutes remaining West Brom tried to find an equaliser but their efforts appeared to be fruitless, even if a shot from Victor Anichebe made Lukasz Fabianski pull off a brilliant save, as he tipped his rasping effort over the bar 13 minutes from time. Berahino in the 81st minute again forced a superb save from Fabianski but the the linesman had already flagged for offside. Swansea manager Francesco Guidolin took the positive aspects from his side's 1-1 draw Swansea manager Francesco Guidolin took the positive aspects from his side's 1-1 draw That looked to be their final meaningful effort of the game before Rondon made the most of a penalty-area scramble to lash the ball in the back of the net seconds after Fletcher had cleared Sigurdsson's effort off the line.

The visitors went in front through Gylfi Sigurdsson's penalty after Tim Howard brought down Andre Ayew following John Stones' weak backpass. Gareth Barry's deflected flick made it 1-1 just eight minutes later but Ayew restored the advantage with an effort which looped in over Howard off Stones. The hosts dominated the second half and a glaring injury-time miss from Seamus Coleman summed up their day as Swansea moved up to 15th in the Premier League table. As well as a priceless three points for the new head coach, the result gives the team he has inherited back-to-back wins for the first time this season. Man of the match Gerard Deulofeu says Everton produced a very poor first half display in their 2-1 defeat at home to Swansea. Man of the match Gerard Deulofeu says Everton produced a very poor first half display in their 2-1 defeat at home to Swansea. Swansea arrived on Merseyside with a win against their opponents in the Capital One Cup last season their only victory in 24 previous meetings. John Stones of Everton battles for the ball with Swansea' Wayne Routledge Roberto Martinez's team began brightly and Muhamed Besic hit the post with a well-struck effort from distance in the opening moments. However just as quickly, they lost him to injury as he had to be replaced by Tom Cleverley due to a recurrence of a hamstring problem. Roberto Martinez says his side started slowly against Swansea but produced enough chances to win the game in their 2-1 defeat to the Swans. Roberto Martinez says his side started slowly against Swansea but produced enough chances to win the game in their 2-1 defeat to the Swans. Gerard Deulofeu was to play a more prominent role in the game as it wore on and he served an early warning of his intentions with a curling effort which Lukasz Fabianski held. Muhamed Besic of Everton leaves the pitch after picking another injury In response, Swansea went ahead - but they did so in somewhat farcical circumstances as Stones and Howard contributed in equal measure to a defensive disaster. The England international's pass back to his goalkeeper was light and Ayew realised quickly, darting in to try and exploit his mistake. Rather than react, Howard waited for the ball to come to him and succeeded only in bringing Ayew down, conceding a penalty and seeing Sigurdsson convert it with confidence and composure. Gylfi Sigurdsson celebrates after scoring from the penalty spot Everton were level eight minutes later, Barry scoring his first goal in two years with the help of a big deflection off Jack Cork which may yet be significant enough to mean it goes down as an own goal. Rather than build on their swift comeback, Everton contrived to fall behind once more having also lost Kevin Mirallas to injury. The ball appeared to strike Ashley Williams' hand in the build-up before Neil Taylor found Ayew, whose shot deflected off Stones and beyond Howard. Everton's Gareth Barry celebrates after scoring against Swansea That made for a second half in which Swansea probably expected to be on the back foot and they weren't to be surprised but not before they came close to a 3-1 lead immediately after the restart - Wayne Routledge's effort being well smothered by Howard - but then Everton dictated. Ross Barkley put the ball over from close range before realising Leighton Baines had been flagged offside and Deulofeu sent in a succession of wonderful crosses but none were finished off. Ayew was on target Romelu Lukaku - making his 100th Everton appearance and seeking a club record-equalling 16th Premier League goal of the season - was culpable. Barkley too failed to take advantage of the terrific service Deulofeu provided and Mirallas' replacement Steven Pienaar was the same. Lukaku then headed over, Coleman screwed a weak effort past the post when he should have done better and both Barry and Coleman claimed for penalties but neither were given. Even when it seemed Everton had lost their chance to equalise, they had one more golden opportunity to do so. But with the last kick of the match, Coleman again produced a poor finish at a corner and put the ball high over the bar when it seemed easier to score to condemn his team to a fifth successive Premier League game without a victory and a stream of boos from the Goodison terraces.

"Diego Costa celebrates giving Chelsea the lead Diego Costa scored the winner after Per Mertesacker's early dismissal to give Chelsea a 1-0 victory over Arsenal on Sunday. Mertesacker was shown a straight red after 18 minutes at the Emirates for bringing down Costa when he was in on goal. Costa gave the visitors the lead five minutes later and Arsenal, who have now not beaten Chelsea in their last nine Premier League meetings, struggled to muster a response. Per Mertesacker fouls Chelsea's Diego Costa and earns himself a red card The home side managed just one shot on target as they failed to score against Chelsea for the sixth successive league match. The defeat sees Arsenal remain third in the league, level on points with Manchester City and three behind leaders Leicester, who they face at the Emirates on February 14. Chelsea, meanwhile, climb up to 13th and preserve their unbeaten record under Guus Hiddink after a hard-fought win. Aaron Ramsey vies with Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic Alexis Sanchez and Eden Hazard returned to the respective squads but only as subs, while Mesut Ozil and Costa were handed starting roles and Pedro missed out with illness. Theo Walcott was named Arsenal captain, 10 years after joining the club, and the hosts spurned an early chance as Joel Campbell miscued a volley inside the box. Former Chelsea keeper Petr Cech was then called into action to keep out a low shot from Oscar at his near post. Diego Costa finishes at the near post Chelsea looked the more composed side in an open start and Willian shot tamely at Cech after his volley rebounded back to him off Mertesacker. The German was then involved in the most significant moment of the first half when he was shown a straight red for bringing down Costa, who looked to be in on goal after running onto Willian's through ball. Gabriel, who saw red in the meeting earlier in the season, was sent on to fill the gap at the back in place of Olivier Giroud, who reacted with surprise before slowly trudging off. Reaction from John Terry and man of the match Cesc Fabregas, who was chief tormentor in Chelsea’s 1-0 win over Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium Reaction from John Terry and man of the match Cesc Fabregas, who was chief tormentor in Chelsea’s 1-0 win over Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium The Frenchman barely had time to get the dugout before Chelsea took the lead, Costa getting ahead of Gabriel to turn in Branislav Ivanovic's cross. With the numerical advantage, Chelsea dominated the remainder of the half, Costa slicing a back-post volley wide and then forcing Cech into a sharp save from a tight angle. Ivanovic had a header cleared off the line in the 43rd minute while Arsenal's best opportunity came in injury-time as Mathieu Flamini flicked a volley over the bar after a clever through ball from Aaron Ramsey. Jamie Carragher, Thierry Henry and Graeme Souness debate Per Mertesacker’s red card against Chelsea, with the panel split over whether it was deserved Jamie Carragher, Thierry Henry and Graeme Souness debate Per Mertesacker’s red card against Chelsea, with the panel split over whether it was deserved The visitors continued to control proceedings after the break but had appeals for a penalty waved away when Laurent Koscielny barged over Fabregas. The introduction of Sanchez after 56 minutes gave Arsenal an extra spark and they soon went close to an equaliser as Hector Bellerin's shot was blocked after a goalmouth scramble. But that was to be a rare opportunity for the Gunners as their attacking threat was largely nullified by Chelsea. Thibaut Courtois almost handed the hosts a late chance when he fumbled a free-kick, but he was helped out by his defenders and Chelsea held on for victory.

The hosts had overcome Roberto Firmino's early opener to hold a 3-1 lead in East Anglia through goals from Dieumerci Mbokani, debutant Steven Naismith and a Wes Hoolahan penalty - all aided by some suspect Liverpool defending. However, Jordan Henderson started what proved a thrilling comeback with a well-taken goal just one minute after Hoolahan's spot-kick, before Firmino equalised with a lovely dinked finish. James Milner celebrates after his strike at Carrow Road And Liverpool weren't done there, as Milner latched on to Russell Martin's awful backpass to fire past Declan Rudd in the Norwich goal to put the Reds back in front. Sebastien Bassong looked to have earned the Canaries a point in injury-time, but straight down the other end, Lallana pounced to wrestle back the three points, Reds boss Jurgen Klopp losing his glasses in the wild celebrations. This is only the third time in Premier League history that Liverpool have recovered from two goals down to win an away game, securing three vital points which sees them move up to seventh - eight points off the top four - while Norwich's relegation fears increase after a game they should have taken something from. Roberto Firmino (left) scores Liverpool's first goal The visitors, who had picked up just one point in three league games, started in the ascendancy and Firmino broke the deadlock in the 18th minute with his fourth goal for the club. Milner held the ball up well, delayed long enough for Firmino to make his run, played him in, and Firmino converted, via the left foot of Rudd. Milner almost got on the scoresheet himself as he raced clear through the heart of a vulnerable-looking Norwich backline, but he was dispossessed at the last by Robbie Brady. Steven Naismith (third left) celebrates after putting Norwich 2-1 up Liverpool were then made to pay for that miss, as Mbokani (29) cleverly back-heeled past Simon Mignolet after the Reds passed up several chances to clear a corner. The game swung completely in the hosts' favour when former Everton forward Naismith (41) fired home on his Norwich debut, Mignolet beaten from a very tight angle. After the break, the drama intensified. The hosts stretched their lead nine minutes after the restart through Hoolahan's audacious penalty, but Alberto Moreno's challenge that conceded the spot-kick was reckless. Wes Hoolahan (left) puts Norwich 3-1 up from the penalty spot With the home fans still taking their seats after celebrating their side's third, Henderson arrived to put his side back in the contest (55), but he was allowed far too much time to convert from the edge of the box from Firmino's flick. There was nothing the hosts could do about an equaliser that came eight minutes later, Liverpool showing their class in creating the opportunity for Firmino to delicately loft the ball over the onrushing Rudd after great work from Lallana to pick him out. The comeback looked complete in the 75th minute, Milner profiting from a gift of a backpass from Martin to fire past Rudd and put Liverpool in front for the second time. Lallana ran over to manager Jurgen Klopp following his goal But their rally seemed in vain as Norwich grabbed what looked like a vital point in their fight for survival through Bassong in stoppage-time. Again Liverpool had ample opportunity to get the ball upfield, but they failed to clear their lines as Norwich pressed, the centre-back firing past Mignolet from the edge of the box (90+2) in a manner any striker would have been proud of. However, in a game that refused to relent, Lallana capitalised on more poor defending after Norwich failed to clear a long ball into the box, and fired past a static Rudd to stun Carrow Road, the matchwinner whipping off his shirt before being joined by colleagues and boss alike in jubilant celebrations.

With the game seemingly set for a draw, the England international controlled a header from Christian Eriksen, flicked the ball over the head of Mile Jedinak and then struck a sweet volley into the bottom corner from outside the box after 84 minutes. Nacer Chadli then made sure of the points in injury-time with another brilliant finish to cement Spurs' place in the top four of the Premier League. Earlier, Harry Kane had equalised for the visitors in the 63rd minute after Jan Vertonghen had diverted Wilfried Zaha's cross into his own net in the first half. With Manchester United losing at home to Southampton, the win enhances Spurs' Champions League prospects, while Palace, who have not won since December 19, slip into the bottom half of the table. Tottenham's Hugo Lloris (R) fails to stop Jan Vertonghen's (left) own goal Palace boss Alan Pardew stuck with keeper Wayne Hennessey after two mistakes in his last two matches, while Spurs' only change from their win over Sunderland saw Heung-Min Son replace Erik Lamela. The visitors dominated possession in the first half, dictating the pace of the game and creating the majority of the chances. Son shot wide from distance before Toby Alderweireld missed the target with a header from a corner. Wilfried Zaha (right) and James McArthur (left) celebrate Crystal Palace's goal The hosts had not scored in eight hours of league action but they were given a helping hand after half an hour as Spurs failed to clear their lines and Zaha's cross was turned into his own net by Vertonghen. The goal did not change the pattern of the game as Spurs continued to search for a way through a packed Palace defence. Kane almost turned in a shot across goal from Alderweireld and Danny Rose volleyed at Hennessey from close range. Harry Kane (centre) celebrates scoring Tottenham's equaliser Spurs continued to dominate after the break but continued to come up short in their hunt for an equaliser as Eriksen fired just past the top corner with a swerving shot and then Kane headed straight at Hennessey. They eventually broke Palace's resistance just after the hour when Kane rose above Damien Delaney to head home Chadli's cross. Tottenham head coach Mauricio Pochettino reacts to his side's win Tottenham head coach Mauricio Pochettino reacts to his side's win But only Hugo Lloris prevented the hosts retaking the lead, pulling off a fantastic stop to keep out Zaha's deflected effort and then saving again from Pape Souare.

Claudio Ranieri's side had won only one of their previous five league games but Danny Drinkwater gave them lead just before half-time and second-half goals from Jamie Vardy and Leonardo Ulloa sealed a win to revive faith in their unlikely hunt for glory. The result puts the Foxes three points clear of Arsenal ahead of the Gunners' clash with Chelsea on Super Sunday. Stoke disappointment was compounded by the fact they lost captain Ryan Shawcross to injury during the first half, meaning he is a doubt for their Capital One Cup semi-final second leg at Liverpool on Tuesday. Danny Drinkwater put Leicester ahead with his first Premier League goal After a slow start, the game came to life just after the 15-minute mark with chances at both ends. First, Erik Pieters played a ball through to Jon Walters but the Irishman opted against taking the shot on his left foot and was crowded out as he tried to shift it onto his right. Less than a minute later and Leicester came close, Riyad Mahrez finding Marc Albrighton down the left and his low cross picked out Jamie Vardy. The striker swivelled and hit it first time but straight at Butland who was unable to hold it. From the resulting corner Mahrez went close with an acrobatic volley having found space eight yards out, the ball whistling just past the post. There was then a big blow for Stoke as Shawcross was forced off injured having initially tried to play on. His departure coincided with Leicester's best spell of the half, Christian Fuchs keeping the Stoke defence busy with a number of long throws and a couple of dangerous crosses while Shinji Okazaki fired over from the edge of the box. The breakthrough finally came three minutes before half-time as Drinkwater fired home from the edge of the box following a succession of Leicester corners. Mark Hughes says his Stoke players were below par Mark Hughes says his Stoke players were below par His shot deflected off Marc Wilson and hit Jack Butland before nestling in the bottom corner, the goal his first in the Premier League and Leicester's first from outside the box this season. The second period took time to get going, The first moment of note coming just before the hour mark as Mahrez, having dispossessed Glenn Whelan, drove at the Stoke defence before belatedly slipping in Okazaki. The pass was under-hit, however, and Ibrahim Afellay was able to make a crucial tackle before the striker could get his shot away. Stoke's best chance came just a couple of minutes later when Glen Johnson delivered a peach of a cross for Joselu, only for Kasper Schmeichel to swat away the Spaniard's header. Leonardo Ulloa scores Leicester's third goal to seal victory against Stoke It proved to be a costly miss as Vardy doubled Leicester's lead in the 66th minute. It was a simple goal that will have frustrated Stoke boss Mark Hughes, Drinkwater clipping a straight ball over the top for Vardy to run onto before coolly rounding Butland and rolling it home for his first goal in eight games. From that point the game drifted with Leicester content to try and see it out and Stoke struggling to create any clear openings. Leicester almost added a third after a fine move ended with Mahrez slipping in Drinkwater only for the midfielder to get caught in two minds, hitting a ball across the face of goal that was neither a shot nor a cross. They did get a third three minutes from time as Mahrez beat Wollscheid with an outrageous piece of skill to get into the box before his attempted shot was deflected into the path of Ulloa, who stabbed home to secure the three points. Paul Merson's Soccer Saturday verdict Paul Merson says Leicester were absolutely superb against Stoke Paul Merson says Leicester were absolutely superb against Stoke \"The energy [Leicester] play with is unbelievable and they blew Stoke away. Jamie Vardy makes runs, closes people down, he plays on the shoulder, he scores the goal and he's away. Butland, he comes out and I'm sure he's got the [Capital One Cup] semi-final in his mind, when he comes out he just stands there. \"Kante and Drinkwater were absolutely unbelievable. They're playing just two in midfield every single week, not three, and they were outstanding again today. \"Shaqiri went off at two-nil down and you're thinking is that for the semi-final? Arnautovic never played, are they waiting on him for Tuesday night? They looked a bit lost today.

Austin came off the bench to score on his debut (87) after drawing a needless free-kick from Adnan Januzaj, the United substitute barely 30 seconds into his first appearance since returning from Borussia Dortmund. The goal sparked a furious response from significant numbers of a home support that had been restless throughout, and the result leaves United five points off the Champions League places. Charlie Austin scored a debut goal for Southampton Charlie Austin scored a debut goal for Southampton Saints' second straight win at United put paid to a five-match unbeaten run that had lifted the pressure on Louis van Gaal, who snapped at renewed press speculation over his position ahead of the game and had to endure some supporters having a very vocal say on his future as he made his way down the touchine at the end. And the Dutchman might now have to revise for good a tentative suggestion, made after last week's win at Liverpool, that United can still play a part in the Premier League title race. Louis van Gaal covers his eyes during a low-key first half Fraser Forster did not have a save of note to make, clutching one long-range Daley Blind shot to his midriff before the break and watching another from Jesse Lingard skid wide. And an initial upsurge in urgency after half-time, sparked by the introduction of Juan Mata and encouraged by the crowd, failed to yield anything more menacing than a couple of penalty-box skirmishes. Instead it was Southampton, who had made and missed the only chance of the first half for Sadio Mane, who emerged as the likelier winners as they won a succession of set-pieces. Louis van Gaal says his side produced a poor display Louis van Gaal says his side produced a poor display Victor Wanyama headed wide at the back post from one while Paddy McNair, on for Matteo Darmian as another United full-back succumbed to injury, denied Shane Long from another. The decisive free-kick need never have been conceded, though. Januzaj was sent on to have an impact in the final few minutes and at least fulfilled that part of the bargain, clumsy contact with Austin giving Saints' new striker the excuse he needed to drop to his knees and claim a decision. Morgan Schneiderlin (right) and Jordy Clasie crunch into a tackle Even then there was no excuse for the lack of marking that allowed Austin to meet James Ward-Prowse's free-kick with the kind of sure finish that persuaded Ronald Koeman to spend £4m on him last week. Januzaj flashed one final half-chance wide as United belatedly piled men forward, but a point would have been scarcely merited. Austin (left) was left unmarked for Southampton's winning goal Charlie Nicholas's Soccer Saturday verdict \"Manchester United were really poor. It lacked speed, tempo. The passing was slow, very predictable. I didn't hear Manchester United fans vocally at all until five minutes before half-time and it was a shot which caused the anger on their faces towards the dugout. Van Gaal bought on Mata for Fellaini, a massive cheer went up. But again they never really threatened. \"He's nothing new; Charlie Austin can guarantee you goals and that's a priceless commodity. They've got him for £4m because they went and tested the water. It's probably not even a gamble but a tax write-off for some of these clubs, it's early for Charlie but he's rewarded straight away. \"This win gathers quite a bit of momentum for Southampton, all of a sudden they're starting to think is top four a possibility?\" Ronald Koeman was full of praise for his side Ronald Koeman was full of praise for his side Player ratings Man Utd: De Gea (6), Darmian

Sunderland's Premier League survival hopes were dealt a blow on Saturday after they were held to a 1-1 draw by Bournemouth at the Stadium of Light. New Bournemouth striker Benik Afobe opened the scoring in the 13th minute with his second goal for the club following his £10m arrival from Wolverhampton Wanderers. But Patrick van Aanholt's equaliser on the stroke of half-time proved enough to earn a point for Sunderland, with Bournemouth forward Lewis Grabban missing a great chance late on to secure a vital win for his side. The draw keeps Sunderland in 19th place in the Premier League, three points from safety, while Bournemouth remain in 15th spot. Ahead of the match on Wearside, Sunderland manager Sam Allardyce said his side could not afford to lose if they hoped to stave off relegation and secure their Premier League status. Benik Afobe gave Bournemouth the lead at the Stadium of Light But he would have been less than pleased by the start his side made as he watched them fall behind inside the opening 15 minutes. The energetic Junior Stanislas was instrumental in the away side's opener, collecting the ball on the right before whipping an enticing delivery into the path of Afobe, who stooped to head past Vito Mannone. Sunderland manager Sam Allardyce was happy to secure a point Sunderland manager Sam Allardyce was happy to secure a point Bournemouth were aiming to maintain their fine recent form on the road having lost just one of their last five Premier League away matches and continued to look the most threatening of the sides with Afobe and Stanislas testing the palms of Mannone. But their first-half dominance was not rewarded with the lead at the interval as Van Aanholt restored parity with his second goal in as many matches. Fabio Borini, restored to the starting line-up after missing last Saturday's 4-1 defeat to Tottenham, collected the ball on the edge of the 18-yard box before finding the run of Van Aanholt. The Dutch left-back made no mistake, rifling his effort beyond Artur Boruc. Fabio Borini played a key role in Sunderland's equaliser Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe warned his side they needed to \"nullify\" Jermain Defoe in order to gain a positive result against Sunderland, but they were nearly undone shortly after the interval when the forward broke free of the away side's defence before curling his shot just wide of the post. Boruc was then called into action to deny Billy Jones and Van Aanholt before Bournemouth substitute Grabban missed arguably the best chance of the second-half. Stanislas, once again instrumental, produced an excellent through-ball and having timed his run to perfection Grabban had only Mannone to beat, but somehow managed to fire his shot wide.

Striker Ighalo put the Hornets in front less than a minute after half-time, then set up Cathcart for their second just before the hour mark. Jamaal Lascelles headed Newcastle back into the game with just under 20 minutes left, but it ended up being just a consolation as Steve McClaren's side failed to climb out of the relegation zone, while Watford rise back into the top half. Craig Cathcart celebrates scoring Watford's second goal against Newcastle Newcastle started the better side, but it was Watford who had the first real chance of the game and it took a brilliant double save by Rob Elliot to keep the home side out. Ighalo fed strike partner Troy Deeney in the box, and his effort was brilliantly kept out by the Newcastle keeper, before he got straight back up to deny Etienne Capoue from close range. A few minutes later it was Heurelho Gomes' chance to save his team, as he made a slightly unorthodox stop with his feet to stop Aleksandar Mitrovic's low drive from the edge of the area after a great move by Newcastle. Newcastle's Jamaal Lascelles scores in the 71st minute to reduce the deficit to 2-1 against Watford There was very little else in the way of goalmouth action in an otherwise quiet first 45 minutes, but the second period got off to a flying start as Ighalo put Watford ahead within 60 seconds of the restart. Deeney picked up the ball in the centre circle before popping a pass in behind Newcastle's defence for his strike partner, and, despite there being shades of offside as he ran through, Ighalo kept his cool to take the ball round Elliot before slotting home his 14th goal of the season. Steve McClaren was delighted with his side's performance Steve McClaren was delighted with his side's performance Watford were well on top at this stage and Ighalo did brilliantly again to make their second for Cathcart after 58 minutes. The Nigerian smartly controlled a cross in the six-yard box before touching it back into the path of his team-mate, who made no mistake in volleying past the helpless Elliot. Newcastle, so used to falling behind this season, rallied well and pulled a goal back in the 71st minute as Lascelles met Jonjo Shelvey's corner. McClaren's side then pushed for an equaliser as Watford started dropping deeper and deeper, but they failed to make another breakthrough to the delight of the home fans at Vicarage Road.

little impact Aston Villa remain nine points from safety after they were held 0-0 in their Midlands derby at West Brom. The teams could muster only one shot on target between them - Jordan Ayew's low effort for Villa which was palmed away by Ben Foster - in an uninspiring first half. Remi Garde's men improved after the break and looked the more likely to score, with substitute Rudy Gestede putting their best chance just wide with a header. Tony Pulis was very happy with his side's efforts in their 0-0 draw Tony Pulis was very happy with his side's efforts in their 0-0 draw West Brom - only seven points clear of the bottom three - hung on for a point which was barely deserved and though Villa continued their mini-revival to make it five games unbeaten in all competitions - including three in the Premier League - their survival prospects remain gloomy. Villa arrived at The Hawthorns looking to avoid losing both league games against West Brom in a season for the first time since 1974 - but were ultimately able to do that as much because of their opponents' lacklustre approach as due to their own endeavours. Carles Gil is tackled by Jonny Evans Garde's team began brightest without creating much and West Brom slowly eased into the game, with Stephane Sessegnon eventually forcing Joleon Lescott into a good tackle to keep him at bay. Ayew then went close with an attempt Foster had to get down smartly for and was then denied a penalty despite Jonas Olsson' seeming to make contact in a slack challenge. Nevertheless, referee Bobby Madley refused to away anything and normal service soon resumed, with both teams guilty of really poor deliveries at set pieces. Remi Garde was disappointed to come away with just a point Remi Garde was disappointed to come away with just a point Away captain Micah Richards was lucky to stay on the park for his careless lunge on Claudio Yacob which eventually drew a yellow card from referee Bobby Madley rather than a red. Villa picked up in the second half but only after a brief rally from West Brom, who wasted openings through Craig Dawson, Sessegnon and Salomon Rondon. Gestede was one of three substitutes introduced with a quarter of the game to go - the others being West Brom's Saido Berahino and Victor Anichebe - and he almost made the most impact. Stephane Sessegnon (left) comes up against Ashley Westwood (right) and Aly Cissokho (middle) He sent a header wide then did the same with another attempt before going off with what appeared to be a hamstring injury. Villa laid siege to the home goal but Ayew could not convert, Foster saved from Ashley Westwood then Idrissa Gana and Leandro Bacuna sent good chances from long range off target. In the end, they took a point when they perhaps merited all three and after Sunderland also drew with Bournemouth, they remain six points adrift at the foot of the standings and 10 - their poor goal difference considered - off safety with 15 matches left. Matt Le Tissier's Soccer Saturday verdict Matt Le Tissier says Aston Villa were the better side in their 0-0 draw Matt Le Tissier says Aston Villa were the better side in their 0-0 draw \"That was the hardest game I've had to watch all season. There didn't seem to be any ambition from either side to push enough men forward to actually cause any kind of panic in the opposition box. Villa were the more dangerous team. For West Brom, to have four attempts on goal at home in a local derby and none on target was absolutely shocking. \"They didn't show any ambition, nobody was really getting anywhere near Rondon to get any support up there, there was a serious lack of creativity in the West Brom side. \"Villa were marginally better, Westwood had a couple of strikes which tested Ben Foster but it was a very poor game.

Aguero scored twice as Manchester City came from behind to rescue a point in a 2-2 draw with West Ham at Upton Park. It took West Ham just 53 seconds to take the lead, with Enner Valencia firing a low shot past Joe Hart and into the back of the net. But in a frantic opening Aguero, who had hit the post minutes earlier, levelled the scores from the penalty spot (9) after being brought down in the box by Carl Jenkinson. After the break, it was the home side that regained the lead with Valencia capitalising on some poor City defending (56) but Aguero had the final word with an 81st-minute equaliser. The result means City move up to second ahead of Arsenal - who face Chelsea on Super Sunday - on goal difference, but they remain three points behind leaders Leicester following their 3-0 win at home to Stoke earlier on Saturday. Slaven Bilic's side stay sixth but move a point behind Manchester United in the European places. West Ham, who named new signing Sam Byram on the bench, raced out of the blocks with Cheikhou Kouyate bursting past Yaya Toure before firing a cross into the box which rebounded off Fabian Delph and into the path of Valenica, who fired a low shot past Hart. Enner Valencia (left) of West Ham celebrates the opening goal Upton Park was rocking after witnessing the second-fastest goal in the Premier League this season but Manchester City responded well with Aguero bringing down Toure's long ball and in one movement lifting the ball over Adrian, only to see it canon back off the post. City did not have to wait long for the equaliser, with Aguero exchanging passes with Silva before turning Jenkinson, who brought the Argentina international down in the box with a reckless challenge. Referee Craig Pawson had no hesitation in pointing to the spot and Aguero picked himself up off the floor to send Adrian the wrong way to level the scores. Debutant Sam Byram (front) holds off Raheem Sterling Jenkinson's night was called to an end just four minutes later when an injury meant he was replaced by Byram, who came on for a quicker-than-expected Premier League debut just three days after his switch from Leeds. The frantic pace of the game continued at Upton Park but we were made to wait until the 34th minute for the next clear-cut chance and it fell to the impressive Dimitri Payet. Jamie Redknapp and Stuart Pearce were both amazed at the poor defending by Nicolas Otamendi for West Ham's second goal against Manchester City Jamie Redknapp and Stuart Pearce were both amazed at the poor defending by Nicolas Otamendi for West Ham's second goal against Manchester City The Frenchman, who helped win the free-kick after Valencia was hauled down by Martin Demichelis, curled a left-footed shot over the wall and towards the top corner but Hart got across to to make a world-class save. Minutes later, Hart was called into action again as Aaron Cresswell's cross looked destined to pick out Valencia at the far post, but the England goalkeeper just got a fingertip to the ball. Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart (left) saves a shot After the break Payet was involved again, sending Mark Noble to the byline and he stood up a teasing ball to the far post which Michail Antonio headed inches wide. Bilic's men were gaining the upper hand but City went close to taking the lead against the run of play in the 55th minute when Fabian Delph's shot beat Adrian but rebounded back off the post. Enner Valencia celebrates after scoring West Ham's second goal Moments later, West Ham were back in front. City switched off at Antonio's quick throw-in as Valencia latched onto the ball ahead Nicolas Otamendi to fire the ball past Hart. West Ham's defence was being pushed deeper and deeper as City searched for an equaliser and with just nine minutes remaining, City substitute Kelechi Iheanacho bundled his way into the penalty and the ball fell to Aguero, who steered it past Adrian. There was still time for a winner and Aguero fired a shot straight at Adrian, while Kouyate's stoppage-time header clipped the crossbar as Manuel Pellegrini's men escaped with a point.

An attritional game was heading for stalemate but the United captain reacted fastest 12 minutes from time, thundering home a rebound after Marouane Fellaini headed off the crossbar.

Rooney, meanwhile - in front of watching England boss Roy Hodgson - has now scored in four successive United games for the first time in four years, Sunday's winner a record 176th Premier League strike as he surpassed Thierry Henry's haul for one team. Rooney fired past Simon Mignolet with just 12 minutes remaining Both teams entered the game on the back of 3-3 draws which seemed to please both managers, Jurgen Klopp making just one change, with Lucas Leiva replacing Jordan Ibe, and Louis van Gaal named an unchanged side.

Man Utd's Wayne Rooney (L) celebrates scoring the winner against Liverpool Jordan Henderson combined brilliantly with Lallana and Firmino to open up the goal but again the finishing was amiss as his effort failed to test De Gea. United's toothless attack was forced to defend as Anthony Martial's crucial intervention, the forward stepping in to dispossess Firmino, prevented Liverpool from hitting United on the counter six minutes before the interval. Michael Carrick joined the United fans in the away end for the match at Anfield Early chances in the second half suggested Klopp had instructed his side to get at United after the break but, having done well to get away from Chris Smalling, Emre Can was denied by De Gea, who deflected the German's effort agonisingly across the face of goal. United enjoyed their best spell of the game shortly after as Martial showed great control to get away from three Liverpool defenders before fizzing a low effort from a narrow angle wide.

De Gea then produced the save of the game to tip Can's rasping drive away on 66 minutes, before denying Firmino's effort on the rebound, before Sakho failed to rise high enough to head Milner's cross home on 72 minutes. Referee Mark Clattenburg talks to Marouane Fellaini of Manchester United And Liverpool were made to pay for their prolificacy in front of goal as United snatched an unlikely victory with their first shot on target. The hosts failed to react to a quick United corner, allowing substitute Juan Mata to find Fellaini in the area. His header struck the bar and fell for Rooney, who made no mistake in sealing a vintage United smash-and-grab raid at the home of their fiercest rivals.

It was a game where both goalkeepers shone as Jack Butland denied Olivier Giroud with two smart saves either side of the break before Petr Cech stood strong in the second period, including thwarting Bojan with a double save. Stoke rallied in the closing stages and Aaron Ramsey cleared off the line from Jonathan Walters. Mark Hughes' men have now lost just one of their eight league games at the Britannia Stadium against Arsenal, who jump above Leicester City in the table but only on goal difference. Two superb performances from Stoke's Jack Butland and Arsenal's Petr Cech kept their encounter goalless Two superb performances from Stoke's Jack Butland and Arsenal's Petr Cech kept their encounter goalless Arsenal entered the Stoke cauldron without Mesut Ozil, who was ruled out with a minor foot injury, while Alexis Sanchez was only 95 per cent fit according to Arsene Wenger and also wasn't risked. There was a place in the squad for new signing Mohamed Elneny, who remained on the bench throughout. Arsenal's Mohamed Elneny was named on the bench The home fans were in boisterous mood as they booed every touch by an Arsenal player in the early stages and the visitors struggled to get into their passing rhythm. Stoke were organised and resolute but were cut open on 21 minutes by the Gunners. Arsene Wenger was left pleased with Arsenal's spirit during their 0-0 draw away to Stoke Arsene Wenger was left pleased with Arsenal's spirit during their 0-0 draw away to Stoke Joel Campbell spotted Giroud's run in behind the Stoke back four and played the perfect ball into his path. The French striker's first touch was perfect as he shifted the ball onto his left foot but Butland was smartly off his line and blocked the ball with a starfish-like dive at the feet of Giroud. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain - Wenger's chosen replacement for Ozil - curled an effort at Butland's goal on 29 minutes from 20 yards but the shot stopper tipped the ball over the crossbar. Mark Hughes felt that Stoke's 0-0 draw against Arsenal was a battle between two evenly-matched teams Mark Hughes felt that Stoke's 0-0 draw against Arsenal was a battle between two evenly-matched teams Butland remained the busier of the two goalkeepers in the early stages of the second period. Ramsey whipped in a brilliant corner from the right which found Giroud eight yards from goal. His header was a powerful one that was heading for the bottom corner until Butland's hand diverted the ball away. Cech had been a bystander for 58 minutes of action, but duty soon called as Stoke upped the tempo.

Bojan found space 20 yards from goal and spanked an effort that was set to hit the back of the net but Cech launched himself to his right to claw the ball away. Bojan reacted quickest to the rebound but the goalkeeper was up quick and forced the shot away at his near post. Joselu was the next Stoke attacker to be denied by Cech as he turned a deflected effort away on 65 minutes. The Gunners enjoyed 57 per cent possession in the second period, but rarely looked capable of breaking through the Stoke backline led impeccably by Ryan Shawcross. Theo Walcott takes on Stoke's Philipp Wollscheid Campbell curled an effort wide from a tight angle with nine minutes left but it was the hosts that came closest to nicking all three points. Glenn Whelen's corner was flicked on at the near post by Walters and with Cech beaten, it was up to Ramsey to save the day and head clear on the goal line. The ball broke to Joselu about 10 yards out but Cech was quick to react and block the effort away with his legs. It was another vital intervention from a goalkeeper who is proving to be one of the signings of the season.

"Christian Eriksen celebrates Tottenham's opener against Sunderland Christian Eriksen scored twice as Tottenham retained their top-four place with a 4-1 thrashing of Sunderland at White Hart Lane. The Dane's two strikes both found the net via sizeable deflections - his first going in off the leg of Lee Cattermole as Spurs were forced to come from behind in the first half of the Saturday lunchtime encounter. Patrick van Aanholt fired the struggling Wearsiders into the lead, but Eriksen scored just two minutes later before the returning Mousa Dembele made it 2-1 to Spurs on the hour mark. Mousa Dembele celebrates scoring Spurs' second goal Eriksen's second went in off the leg of substitute Jan Kirchhoff, whose nightmare debut was confirmed when he gave away the penalty for Tottenham's fourth - converted by Harry Kane. Dembele was one of three Spurs changes to the side beaten at home by Leicester on Wednesday, with right-back Kyle Walker dropped altogether and Danny Rose also returning. Tottenham's Kieran Trippier heads the ball away Sunderland boss Sam Allardyce started with two up front, with Danny Graham joining former Spurs favourite Jermain Defoe as one of two changes, and they capitalised on a period of uncertainty for Tottenham after their midweek loss to Leicester. Walker had trouble in that game on Wednesday and was replaced by Kieran Trippier, as Dembele made his first start since December and Rose came in for Ben Davies. The home side had a number of shots blocked and saved in the first half-hour through Dele Alli and Kane, while Erik Lamela should have done better after he was put through on the break by Dembele. Sam Allardyce and Mauricio Pochettino watch from the sidelines But an incisive pass from Adam Johnson split open the Spurs back four and allowed Van Aanholt to fire home the opener inside Hugo Lloris' near post on 40 minutes. That proved the inspiration Tottenham needed and they went straight down the other end and equalised through Eriksen after Kane's initial shot had been saved by young 'keeper Jordan Pickford, who was making his first Premier League start. Spurs maintained their dominance in the second half and made it count with three fine goals, the first from Dembele who shot low and hard into the near corner from distance on 59 minutes. Eriksen was on target twice at White Hart Lane on Saturday Eriksen played a major part in the hosts' improvement after the break and his long-range shot ricocheted over Pickford's head via Kirchhoff, who was brought on as Allardyce shifted to three centre-backs to no avail. Rose was then brought down by Kirchhoff, who signed from Bayern Munich last week, inside the box on 79 minutes and Kane stepped up to coolly to slot home his 15th goal of the season in all competitions.

Dan Gosling headed the Cherries in front on 10 minutes, before Charlie Daniels doubled their lead from the penalty spot after the break. Afobe then finished from close range late on for his first goal following his club-record £10m transfer from Wolves last week. New Bournemouth signing Benik Afobe was delighted after scoring his first-ever Premier league goal New Bournemouth signing Benik Afobe was delighted after scoring his first-ever Premier league goal It was Bournemouth's first win in five Premier League games, and the biggest of their short top-flight tenure lifts them above the Canaries into 15th. Eddie Howe was forced into making one change from the side that lost 3-1 at home to West Ham in midweek, with the injured Matt Ritchie making way for Marc Pugh, and the replacement did brilliantly to create the first goal after 10 minutes. Dan Gosling heads home for Bournemouth Pugh picked up the ball on the left, before turning inside onto his right foot and curling a delightful cross onto the head of Gosling, who nodded home from six yards. Bournemouth kept the pressure up as Norwich struggled to get into the game but, despite all the possession, rarely threatened Declan Rudd's goal again in the first half, both Gosling and Harry Arter going relatively close with efforts from outside the box. Gosling celebrates scoring his team's first goal The Norwich keeper would be involved as the opening 45 minutes came to a close, however, when he rushed out of his area and brought down Afobe. The home fans appealed for a red card, but referee Bobby Madley awarded Rudd a booking. It took just nine minutes after the break for Bournemouth to score their second. Having had two penalty appeals turned down already, they were given a spot-kick after the excellent Pugh was brought down in the box by Vadis Odjidja-Ofoe. Rudd went the right way, but Daniels' effort was too precise as it clipped the inside of the post and went in. Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe says his side put in an assured display Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe says his side put in an assured display Norwich reacted by making two substitutions straight away, throwing on striker Cameron Jerome and winger Nathan Redmond, but it made little difference as Bournemouth controlled proceedings until finding their third 15 minutes from time. Norwich manager Alex Neil said his side didn't deserve anything out of the game and the best side won Norwich manager Alex Neil said his side didn't deserve anything out of the game and the best side won Afobe, whose work-rate was superb throughout, got onto the end of Daniels' excellent cross from the left and made no mistake as he side-footed it home from close range. The striker then went off a few minutes later after receiving treatment, but it appeared to be just precautionary and he was given a standing ovation as he departed the pitch at a delighted Vitality Stadium. Charlie Daniels of Bournemouth coverts the penalty to score his team's second goal Paul Merson's Soccer Saturday verdict \"Bournemouth were outstanding from start to finish. These two teams are miles apart. Pugh on the left was outstanding, and justified his manager's decision to play him over Iturrbe. Afobe is lively, gets everywhere.

scoring Chelsea's third goal deep into stoppage-time John Terry followed up an own goal with a controversial equaliser in the 98th minute to rescue a point for Chelsea in a pulsating 3-3 draw with Everton. After a uninspiring goalless first half, the game at Stamford Bridge burst into life with all six goals coming in the second period, Everton racing into a 2-0 lead through Terry's mishap and then a wonderful Kevin Mirallas effort. Chelsea, who are just six points above the relegation zone, responded with two quick-fire goals from Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas, but Toffees substitute Ramiro Funes Mori flicked home what looked like the winning goal on 90 minutes. Chelsea's John Terry says that his side showed unbelievable fight to grab a late equaliser at home to Everton Chelsea's John Terry says that his side showed unbelievable fight to grab a late equaliser at home to Everton However, there was one last twist deep into injury-time as Terry - who appeared offside - flicked home to make amends and preserve Guus Hiddink's unbeaten record on his return to Stamford Bridge. There was more than an air of nervousness in the air in west London as Hiddink went in search of his first win at home in the Premier League. Everton boss Roberto Martinez was left angered with the officials after his side conceded a late equaliser Everton boss Roberto Martinez was left angered with the officials after his side conceded a late equaliser Chelsea lacked fluency in the opening stages and with the crowd getting restless it was Everton that controlled proceedings. Willian had a strike tipped to safety by Tim Howard but the best chance of the half fell to Mirallas, who spun away from Kurt Zouma before firing an effort towards the bottom corner that was brilliantly palmed away by Thibaut Courtois. Everton duo Leighton Baines and Ross Barkley celebrate the opening goal Both goalkeepers were far busier after the break as the game turned into a Premier League classic. The eventual hero, Terry, who was making his 700th professional appearance, sparked the scoring with an unfortunate own goal on 50 minutes. Everton worked the ball to Leighton Baines on the left and he fizzed a cross into the middle. Terry slid in to try and clear the ball but only deflected it against his own body and over the line. Kevin Mirallas, Aaron Lennon, Romelu Lukaku and Ross Barkley celebrate Everton's second Everton took advantage of Chelsea's wobbles and doubled the lead five minutes later. Just after Ross Barkley had hammered the post, they worked the ball to Baines and he pinged a quick ball into Mirallas' feet. He had plenty to do but with a quick shimmy he made space to hammer a fantastic half-volley into the far corner. Kevin Mirallas says that Everton controlled the game at Stamford Bridge but were denied all three points late on Kevin Mirallas says that Everton controlled the game at Stamford Bridge but were denied all three points late on Chelsea needed inspiration from somewhere and they got it through Costa, who scored his fifth goal in his last five games. Fabregas looped a 60-yard ball over Phil Jagielka's head, which drew Howard out of his goal. The lack of communication between the pair opened the door for Costa to nip in and have the easy task of rolling the ball into an empty net. Stamford Bridge was now rocking and Everton crumbled. Chelsea manager Guus Hiddink was proud of the way his team fought back to claim a point in a spectacular game Chelsea manager Guus Hiddink was proud of the way his team fought back to claim a point in a spectacular game Two minutes later Costa and Fabregas executed a quick one-two on the edge of the area before the midfielder struck an effort, which deflected beyond the clutches of Howard. The game lost all shape and logic in the remaining stages as both teams ploughed forward in search of a winner. It was a breathless period. Diego Costa goes around Everton's goalkeeper Tim Howard to pull a goal back for Chelsea Costa sliced wide a presentable chance from close range before Mirallas scampered clear on goal but was denied by a brave save from Courtois. Bryan Oviedo was then stretched off with a leg injury - a worrying sign for the Everton man, who suffered a double leg break in January 2014. He was joined on the treatment room by Costa on 80 minutes after he limped off with a calf strain. Both injures meant there would be seven minutes of injury time to be played - a period which started and finished with a bang. Cesc Fabregas celebrates scoring Chelsea's second goal Everton substitute Gerard Deulofeu found space on the right wing to bend over a delicious cross that took out the entire Chelsea defence and Courtois. Funes Mori, who replaced Oviedo, was waiting at the back post to prod home before tearing off into the away end to celebrate with his supporters, ripping off his protective head band in the process. It looked like the winning goal - but the scoring wasn't finished yet. As the clock ticked past the 97th minute, a long ball into Everton territory was flicked on by Zouma, Branislav Ivanovic, and then Oscar. The ball dropped to Terry, who was a yard offside, and he skilfully flicked the ball past Howard. Cue bedlam in the stands, and anger on the Everton bench. John Terry celebrates his Chelsea equaliser deep into injury-time Matt Le Tissier's Soccer Saturday verdict \"Take nothing away from John Terry's finish, but he was offside. It was a pulsating second half. At half time if you said to me that this would have ended 3-3, I would not have believed you. Martinez sets his teams up to take risks and get forward. That leaves them vulnerable at the back. \"Fair play to Everton after getting themselves back in the lead after Chelsea came back. I have never seen a Chelsea side defend this badly. It is bizarre to see after so many years of being so solid at the back. For the third goal, three Chelsea players just stood and watched. Absolutely static.

Crystal Palace 4-0 in a low-key game to stay in touch at the top of the Premier League. Aguero's 12th and 13th (41, 68) goals of the season followed Fabian Delph's opener (22), and the Argentine passed up the chance of a hat-trick to lay City's fourth on a plate for David Silva (84) with the argument long since settled. Fabian Delph says he was happy to score the first goal but more pleased by the work ethic shown by the whole City team Fabian Delph says he was happy to score the first goal but more pleased by the work ethic shown by the whole City team The result briefly sent City top on goal difference, but Leicester ended the day a point clear after drawing 1-1 at Aston Villa in the evening game. Defeat was a third on the spin for Palace in the league, and Alan Pardew's side have now gone five games in the competition without finding the net. Manuel Pellegrini felt the first goal was so important for Manchester City because it meant Crystal Palace had to attack Manuel Pellegrini felt the first goal was so important for Manchester City because it meant Crystal Palace had to attack Palace could at least cling to the division's best away defensive record before kick-off, but that bit the dust during an odd game which saw City score four while looking half as menacing as they had in drawing a blank against Everton on Wednesday night. Manuel Pellegrini called that result \"an accident\", but City's boss might concede fortune's equal role in the two goals that sent his side into half-time against Palace in total control. The first was a goalkeeping error from Wayne Hennessey, not quite as blatant as his midweek gaffe at Aston Villa but enough to allow Delph's 30-yard strike to squirm under his dive, and if the second initially appeared another blot on his copybook then replays showed Aguero's effort had taken a decisive deflection off Scott Dann's head. Fabian Delph of Manchester City celebrates with team-mate Kevin De Bruyne after scoring the opening goal Palace's opportunity to get a first Premier League point at the Etihad had come and gone by then with two squandered Damien Delaney chances, one headed too close to Joe Hart with the game goalless and the other hooked over an empty net at 1-0 after the keeper fluffed a clearance upfield. Yohan Cabaye's free-kick also extended Hart before the break, but the visitors' promising start to the second half was interrupted by an injury to Aleksandar Kolarov serious enough to require a stretcher and a summons from the bench for Gael Clichy. Palace manager Alan Pardew says there were plenty of good things to take from his side's performance, despite losing 4-0 Palace manager Alan Pardew says there were plenty of good things to take from his side's performance, despite losing 4-0 With the game drifting the snow-soaked crowd could barely muster a jeer when Delaney inadvertently clattered a linesman, but City quickened the pulse with a beautiful third as disguised passes from Yaya Toure and Kevin De Bruyne gave Aguero a simple second. The mood of selflessness was clearly catching: Aguero had just Hennessey to beat as City broke from a Palace corner but chose instead to lay on Silva's first league goal since August. Manchester City's Spanish midfielder David Silva scores his team's fourth goal Phil Thompson's Soccer Saturday verdict \"Palace had a great chance early on which they had to take. City grew into the game, and as soon as they got the goal, the result was never in doubt. \"Sergio Aguero was very good. Scored two goals and an assist. Not a bad afternoon.

Georginio Wijnaldum gives his reaction after scoring for Newcastle, as they hung on for a win over West Ham Georginio Wijnaldum gives his reaction after scoring for Newcastle, as they hung on for a win over West Ham Steve McClaren's side move up to 17th and two points clear of the relegation zone for now, with Swansea hosting Watford on Monday Night Football. West Ham remain fifth, four points behind Tottenham following Spurs' 4-1 win over Sunderland earlier in the day. Ayoze Perez celebrates scoring Newcastle's opener Buoyed by both their midweek fightback against Manchester United and the arrivals of new signings Shelvey and Henri Saivet, Newcastle started brightly against the Hammers. Perez, who had already seen Adrian save his early side-footed effort, fired the Magpies into a sixth-minute lead, curling the ball beyond the dive of Adrian after Wijnaldum had laid the ball off from Shelvey's pass. Newcastle boss Steve McClaren was delighted with his side's first-half display Newcastle boss Steve McClaren was delighted with his side's first-half display It was the perfect start for Newcastle and their new £12m man, but in the 13th minute West Ham could have been back on level terms but for a crucial intervention from captain Fabricio Coloccini. Aaron Cresswell fired in a low cross from the left and with Michail Antonio poised at the back post, Coloccini got back to deny the winger. It turned out to be a crucial intervention as two minutes later Shelvey, who was involved in a an off-the-ball incident with Enner Valencia not spotted by referee Neil Swarbrick, fired out a brilliant cross-field pass to Daryl Janmaat, who picked out Wijnaldum, and he smashed the ball home from close range to score his ninth goal of the season. Wijnaldum fires his shot past Adrian and into the roof of the net Newcastle continued to cause the visitors' defence problems with Aleksandar Mitrovic denied by Adrian, but they were given a warning just before the break when they needed Rob Elliot to keep out Cheikhou Kouyate's powerful strike. Wijnaldum could have made it 3-0 within minutes of the restart but he scuffed his shot wide after good link-up play with Moussa Sissoko and Mitrovic. Nikica Jelavic handed West Ham a lifeline minutes after the restart That miss was to prove costly as West Ham hit back seconds later, Jelavic latching onto Chancel Mbemba's short back-pass before rounding the keeper to pull a goal back. The visitors were buoyed yet dominated most of the second-half possession without ever really threatening the Newcastle goal. Slaven Bilic was frustrated to see West Ham's unbeaten run end at Newcastle after a slow start Slaven Bilic was frustrated to see West Ham's unbeaten run end at Newcastle after a slow start Newcastle still looked the more likely to add a third with Mitrovic forcing two saves from Adrian and Shelvey, who impressed on his first outing for the club, as McClaren's men looked to hit their opponents on the break. West Ham did have one final chance to grab an equaliser with Kouyate leaping highest to head Jelavic's cross goalwards, but Elliot produced an 89th-minute save to deny the visitors. Jonjo Shelvey enjoyed an impressive debut for Newcastle Charlie Nicholas' Soccer Saturday verdict \"The difference was Shelvey. He does try too many Hollywood passes, but when he gets it right it looks amazing. Players are looking at him and want to give it him. \"Magnificent three points for them. Steve McClaren will have a big smile on his face. They played with a high tempo, pass and move scenario that had an end product. \"West Ham are always intriguing, Payet was on the ball all the time but it never really happened for them today. Defensively there are concerns. They were a little bit all over the place.\" Charlie Nicholas discusses Newcastle's 2-1 win against West Ham at St James' Park Charlie Nicholas discusses Newcastle's 2-1 win against West Ham at St James' Park Player ratings Newcastle: Elliot (7), Janmaat (7), Mbemba (5), Coloccini (7), Dummett (6), Sissoko (7), Shelvey (8), Colback (7), Wijnaldum (8), Perez (8), Mitrovic (7).

The Saints midfielder dispatched a curling 25-yard free-kick to open the scoring after five minutes on Saturday afternoon, before doubling the lead from the penalty spot ten minutes before half-time. West Brom went close through Victor Anichebe's volley midway through the second half, but substitute Dusan Tadic sealed the three points with an excellent finish from close range. Southampton's James Ward-Prowse got on the scoresheet for the first time this season with two goals Southampton's James Ward-Prowse got on the scoresheet for the first time this season with two goals The two sides started Saturday level on points, but the victory sees Southampton move up to 10th while the Baggies remain 13th after their fourth away league defeat of the season. There was a feel-good factor around St Mary's before kick-off after the club announced the signing of striker Charlie Austin - who watched from the stands - in the build-up, and the Saints started the brighter, going ahead early on through Ward-Prowse. James Ward-Prowse converts the penalty after Matt Targett was fouled by Craig Dawson The Saints midfielder lined up a free-kick after Sadio Mane was fouled 25 yards from goal, and whipped the ball over the wall and past Myhill, giving the West Brom goalkeeper little chance. Southampton enjoyed 80 per cent possession in the opening exchanges on a pitch hosting its third game in eight days, but the Baggies almost levelled after 10 minutes. Craig Gardner was left unmarked and the midfielder flicked James McClean's cross just wide with Fraser Forster rooted to the spot. Ronald Koeman looks on prior to the match With Ronald Koeman's side on the front foot, Pulis tweaked his formation, bringing Stephane Sessegnon alongside Anichebe on the half-hour mark, but five minutes later Southampton doubled their lead. Ward-Prowse had scored just once in his previous 92 league appearances, but got his second of the afternoon from the penalty spot after good work from Matt Targett. Southampton manager Ronald Koeman said it was a good week all round with back-to-back wins and the new signing of Charlie Austin Southampton manager Ronald Koeman said it was a good week all round with back-to-back wins and the new signing of Charlie Austin The defender, who was impressive against Watford in midweek, played a neat one-two with Shane Long, and as he looked to retrieve the return pass, was bundled over by Craig Dawson. Referee Martin Atkinson had turned down a West Brom penalty appeal shortly before, although replays showed the challenge on Gardner was outside the box, and Ward-Prowse made no mistake when given the opportunity for Southampton. James Ward-Prowse celebrates his brace for the Saints The Saints could have made it three two minutes later, but Targett's low drive was cleared off the line by James McClean. Tony Pulis made a double change at the interval, bringing on Salomon Rondon and Chris Brunt, and West Brom initially improved. Sadio Mane was a constant threat on the break for Southampton The lively combination of Long and Mane continued to offer an outlet for the hosts, but the latter could only manage to guide his shot wide at full stretch. And the away side almost halved the deficit through Anichebe with 25 minutes remaining. The Baggies striker took the ball on his chest before firing a low volley from the edge of the box narrowly past the far post. Dusan Tadic helped Southampton secure all three points Dusan Tadic helped Southampton secure all three points Mane was withdrawn for Tadic in the closing stages, and for the second time in as many games, the Serb substitute sealed the points. Steven Davis, who was excellent all afternoon, led the counter-attack after latching on to Long's flick and driving into the West Brom half. The midfielder cut inside and slipped a disguised reverse pass into the path of Tadic, who fired across the face of goal and into the far corner. Stephane Sessegnon was kept in check before being substituted Pulis ended the game with Saido Berahino, Rondon and Anichebe in attack, but it wasn't a performance to remember as his side failed to test Forster once. The Southampton 'keeper has clean sheets in both games since his return, but after three consecutive home league wins, his side faces a tougher challenge with trips to Old Trafford and the Emirates Stadium to come next. Tony Pulis was unhappy with West Brom's performance in their 3-0 loss to Southampton, and said the best side won Tony Pulis was unhappy with West Brom's performance in their 3-0 loss to Southampton, and said the best side won West Brom host Aston Villa at The Hawthorns next weekend, but first must travel to Bristol City for their FA Cup third-round replay on Tuesday night.

with his Aston Villa team-mates after scoring the equaliser against Leicester Rudy Gestede's second-half strike rescued a point for Aston Villa and stopped Leicester opening up a three-point gap at the top of the Premier League table. Shinji Okazaki opened the scoring (28) in the first half at Villa Park on Saturday evening to put the away side ahead in a feisty Midlands derby, before Riyad Mahrez spurned a golden chance to put Leicester two up from the spot. The visitors paid for Mahrez's second successive penalty miss as substitute Gestede struck 15 minutes from time to send Villa Park into raptures and ensure Leicester only top the Premier League by a single point going into Sunday's matches. The draw left battling Villa nine points from safety but boss Remi Garde will likely take heart from improved performances in what seems like a futile struggle against the drop. Claudio Ranieri's had the first chance of an absorbing and even opening quarter of an hour, when Jamie Vardy squeezed a header at goal. Leicester moved back to the top of the Premier League after drawing 1-1 with relegation strugglers Aston Villa Leicester moved back to the top of the Premier League after drawing 1-1 with relegation strugglers Aston Villa The ball was whipped in, before the England man emerged above a crowd of players to glance an effort at goal. Mark Bunn was left scrambling to his right, but the ball glided just wide of the post. Seconds later, Vardy was again at the centre of a Leicester attack, beating Mark Bunn to the ball before being sent flying to the turf by a late sliding challenge. The presence of covering defenders meant it was just a yellow card for Bunn, but it was another reminder of the England man's ability to create something from nothing. Leicester's Shinji Okazaki celebrates opening the scoring at Villa Park On the 20-minute mark, and with Leicester beginning to assert their authority, Villa were gifted a gilt-edged chance after a mistake by Robert Huth. His under-hit back-pass gave Libor Kozak a run at goal but the seldom-used striker, only appearing in his third Premier League match of the season, saw Kasper Schmeichel save well at the near post and any chance on the rebound was soon snuffed out. Aston Villa manager Remi Garde felt his side should have been awarded a penalty in their 1-1 draw with Leicester Aston Villa manager Remi Garde felt his side should have been awarded a penalty in their 1-1 draw with Leicester It seemed Villa would not have a better chance to go ahead and it proved the case, as Leicester took the lead later in the first half. A frantic five minutes began with the goal, Vardy again getting in behind the Villa defence to start a move out of nothing. Jordan Veretout battles with Okazaki (L) and Marc Albrighton (R) The striker aimed a shot at goal, with Bunn scrambling back to his line to make a save. He clawed the initial effort away brilliantly, but it fell to Okazaki for a second bite at the cherry. Again, Bunn saved, but his initial stop from Vardy had put him behind the goal-line. The referee's watch vibrated and the goal was given - the ball had indeed crossed the line, and Leicester led 1-0. Leicester manager Claudio Ranieri said he felt his side had lost two points Leicester manager Claudio Ranieri said he felt his side had lost two points Minutes later, the Foxes should have made it two. The ball fell to Mahrez at the back post, and his shot was blocked by Aly Cissokho. As screams for handball went up, the referee pointed to the spot and Mahrez was given a great opportunity to double his lead. After the melee had cleared, the Algerian forward struck his penalty firmly down the middle, but the outstretched leg of a diving Bunn saved the shot and put the ball over the crossbar, to ensure Villa were only one down at the break. Gestede wheels away in celebration In the second half, it was all Villa as they searched for a way back in, with Villa Park roaring them on. There were claims for a penalty on the hour mark when Huth swung an arm at Kozak, but the referee waved away the protests. Gestede came on as a substitute and made his mark within 10 minutes when a ball bobbled into his feet and up onto his arm, play continuing as it was deemed not deliberate. He turned and fired a shot that nicked off Wes Morgan and squeezed into the top corner to level the scores. Jamie Vardy and Leandro Bacuna square off as the final whistle approaches Tempers frayed between Vardy and Leandro Bacuna in the latter stages, but despite both sides fighting for a winner, the spoils were shared and each team left with a hard-earned point.

James McClean's late strike earned West Bromwich Albion a 2-2 draw with Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday night. The champions had led through Cesar Azpilicueta's 20th-minute goal, only for Craig Gardner to equalise with a long-range shot just past the half-hour mark. However, the home side appeared to be heading towards back-to-back league wins for the first time this season when Gareth McAuley put through his own net 16 minutes from time, before McClean's intervention. James McClean says that West Brom showed their character as they claimed a point at Chelsea James McClean says that West Brom showed their character as they claimed a point at Chelsea As a result, Chelsea remain down in 14th place in the table after a sixth draw of the campaign, while the Baggies drop to 13th, three points ahead of their opponents. Chelsea boss Guus Hiddink was still without injured playmaker Eden Hazard, with the Dutchman making three changes from the side that beat Crystal Palace in the Premier League last time out. Tony Pulis was pleased West Brom had a decision go their way after he admitted that Claudio Yacob was lucky not to see red Tony Pulis was pleased West Brom had a decision go their way after he admitted that Claudio Yacob was lucky not to see red The Baggies, meanwhile, brought back Jonas Olsson, James McClean and Salomon Rondon in place of Craig Gardner, Rickie Lambert and Stephane Sessegnon, although unsettled striker Saido Berahino was once again only a substitute. However, West Brom manager Tony Pulis was forced into making an early change when key midfielder James Morrison joined the long list of players to have suffered hamstring injuries over the Christmas period, with Gardner replacing him after just seven minutes. Cesar Azpilicueta of Chelsea celebrates scoring his team's first goal against West Brom It was not long though before Chelsea took the lead, albeit slightly against the run of play, after right-back Branislav Ivanovic's brilliant ball across the six-yard box found its way through to fellow full-back Azpilicueta at the far post. And the Spain international had no problems whatsoever converting his second goal of the season from virtually on the goalline. Thibaut Courtois was left feeling disappointed after his Chelsea side were held to a draw by West Brom Thibaut Courtois was left feeling disappointed after his Chelsea side were held to a draw by West Brom But if the champions thought that strike would lead to more goals before half-time, they were much mistaken as West Brom refused to be cowed by falling behind, with Gardner drawing then level just 13 minutes later. The midfielder picked up possession of the ball midway through the Chelsea half and drove towards the home defence, before drilling a low effort from 25 yards out past a helpless Thibaut Courtois. Minutes after the visitors had equalised, midfielder Claudio Yacob was fortunate to find himself still on the pitch after pulling back the breaking Oscar having been booked earlier in the game. Guus Hiddink says Chelsea's game with West Brom was an intense affair and believes Claudio Yacob should have been sent off Guus Hiddink says Chelsea's game with West Brom was an intense affair and believes Claudio Yacob should have been sent off The home side's anger only increased after the break when the Argentine clashed with Diego Costa on the edge of the penalty area, only for referee Anthony Taylor to once again keep his cards in his pocket, with Pulis immediately withdrawing his player. That moment of controversy was soon forgotten, though, when the Blues went back in front after good approach play down the right by Willian. And when the Brazilian crossed from the byline, the ball somehow ended up in the back of the net off a combination of Kenedy, introduced at the break for the disappointing Pedro, and McAuley. But if Hiddink's team thought they had secured all three points, then they were wrong as their stubborn opponents refused to lie down, with McClean earning West Brom a deserved point after his low shot from the edge of the area beat Courtois with just four minutes to go.

The Toffees keeper saved well from Yaya Toure's header in the first half and then kept City at bay after the break as they piled on the pressure. Sergio Aguero was twice denied by the American while Raheem Sterling also saw a shot saved before having appeals for a late penalty waved away when he went down under a challenge from John Stones.

Everton, meanwhile, maintain their impressive away form this season that has seen them only lose once on the road. Aguero reacts to another missed City chance Phil Jagielka made his first league appearance for the Toffees since late October, with John Stones playing at right-back for Everton in the absence of the injured Seamus Coleman. David Silva started on the bench for City and it was the hosts who created the first opening in the rain as Toure's header from Bacary Sagna's cross was well saved by Howard. Phil Jagielka was pleased with Everton's draw at the Etihad Phil Jagielka was pleased with Everton's draw at the Etihad Joe Hart then denied Gerard Deulofeu from a tight angle at the other end before Leon Osman almost opened the scoring in spectacular style, firing a first-time volley across goal and just wide.

The Saints dominated throughout at St Mary's, and capitalised on a strong start when Shane Long opened the scoring with a flicked header after 17 minutes. Sadio Mane squandered a glorious opportunity to double Southampton's advantage 10 minutes before half-time, but substitute Dusan Tadic made the game safe with a low finish on 73 minutes. Ronald Koeman was delighted with Southampton's 2-0 win over Watford Ronald Koeman was delighted with Southampton's 2-0 win over Watford Watford, uncharacteristically toothless in attack, were made to wait until the 84th minute for their only shot on target as they dropped to a third consecutive league defeat. The Hornets made four changes from their FA Cup victory over Newcastle, while Southampton welcomed back goalkeeper Fraser Forster after nine months out with a broken knee-cap. The biggest alteration for the home side, though, was a tactical tweak by manager Ronald Koeman as Ryan Bertrand slotted in at centre-back in a 3-5-2 formation. Ronald Koeman's 3-5-2 formation kept Watford's in-form strike partnership quiet on Wednesday Designed to keep a spare man for in-form duo Troy Deeney and Odion Ighalo, it also freed Matt Targett, making his seventh league start of the season, and the Southampton youngster was a constant thorn in Watford's side. His swinging delivery from the left led to Southampton's opener as Long stole a march on Miguel Britos and glanced an expert header into the far corner for his fifth league goal of the campaign. That came after Watford's best spell of the first half, as Allan Nyom twice overlapped Almen Abdi to provide searching crosses for Ighalo and Deeney. Shane Long (right) celebrates after putting Southampton ahead with a low header But Nyom's frequent forays into the Saints half allowed Targett and Mane to make the most of the vacated space, and the latter went close to doubling Southampton's advantage only for Gomes to tip his shot wide at the last moment. Targett harried Nyom into a mistake seven minutes after Long's header, but the goalscorer could not finish for a second time past Gomes before Mane squandered a golden opportunity to make it two. The Hornets, sloppy throughout the opening 45 minutes, gifted possession to Mane after a misjudged square pass from Jose Manuel Jurado, but the Southampton forward clipped the post with his low effort. Quique Sanchez Flores was frustrated with the way that Watford played at Southampton Quique Sanchez Flores was frustrated with the way that Watford played at Southampton Forster was a virtual bystander as Ighalo saw Watford's one opportunity cleared for a corner. The away side pounced on Cedric Soares, and swept the ball forward to the in-form striker, who beat Jose Fonte but Bertrand recovered to deflect the goal-bound shot wide. Three minutes after the restart Gomes and Mane collided as the latter looked to head home, before Mane looked for Long with a back-heel when well-placed to shoot himself. Southampton's Jose Fonte says it was important to stop their bad run of results with a win over Watford Southampton's Jose Fonte says it was important to stop their bad run of results with a win over Watford The Hornets improved marginally following the introduction of Ikechi Anya, and the substitute nearly found Ighalo with a driven cross with just under half an hour to play. Southampton had the ball in the net shortly after, but Steven Davis was adjudged offside after a fine through ball from Oriol Romeu. Cedric Soares comes up against Jose Manuel Jurado in the second half And the Saints still had time to waste two more good chances before Tadic put the game beyond Watford with just over 15 minutes remaining. Mane and Long failed to convert Virgil van Dijk's low centre before Mane whipped a low shot past Gomes' near post, but the home side eventually made their pressure pay. Tadic held off two Watford challenges to slot past Gomes just two minutes after coming on, and Southampton comfortably saw out the final stages. Having lost eight of their previous 10 before Wednesday's game, the Saints will head into Saturday's fixture at home to West Brom with renewed confidence, while for Watford, they must look to bounce back on their travels at Swansea on Monday Night Football.

in the Premier League on Wednesday evening, with the Canaries playing for more than an hour with 10 men after Gary O'Neil's red card. The midfielder was dismissed for a reckless tackle on Ibrahim Afellay on the half an hour mark, with all four goals coming in the second half. Jon Walters struck for the Potters three minutes after the restart, but there was brief hope for Norwich after Johnny Howson equalised with a stunning goal. However, Stoke were too strong for the depleted Canaries, with Joselu adding a second before Ryan Bennett's headed own goal rounded off a comfortable victory for the hosts. Stoke's Jon Walters says his side could have won by more against Norwich Stoke's Jon Walters says his side could have won by more against Norwich Mark Hughes' men now move up to seventh in the Premier League table - three points from fifth - while Norwich stay in 15th place on 23 points. Norwich settled the quicker at the Britannia, but it was Stoke who tested the goalkeeper first after Marko Arnautovic let fly at the Declan Rudd after some great hold up play from Joselu, but the goalkeeper got down well to keep him out. The visitors showed some great patience in their build-up play in the opening period, with their first effort coming courtesy of Howson, who tried his luck from 30 yards out - only to see the ball fly over Jack Butland's bar. Jonathan Walters scored Stoke's first goal three minutes into the second half Dieumerci Mbokani was a work horse for Norwich throughout the game, and he was gifted a run at goal after a mistake from Afellay, who eventually got back to clear after the Norwich striker failed to make a quick decision. Arnautovic was involved in two big opportunities as Stoke got on top. The first chance came just after the 20 minute mark as Walters got in front of his defender to latch onto the cross but could only poke wide, with Joselu rifling an effort into the side netting minutes later. But there was no time to reflect on missed chances as another peculiar mistake - this time from Butland - saw a skewed goal kick at the feet of Wes Hoolahan, who happily took aim but could only put it wide of an open net. Joselu (centre) celebrates scored Stoke's second goal against Norwich However, the England shot-stopper certainly atoned for his mistake not long after, making a great save from Bennett at close range. The turning point of game came just after 30 minutes when O'Neil was shown a straight red card for a poor challenge on Afellay. It was an unnecessary tackle as the Stoke man was ushering the ball out of play, but O'Neil had other ideas as he flew into a crunching tackle on the winger, with staff and players alike up in arms as referee Neil Swarbrick produced the red card. Norwich boss Alex Neil says that the red card received by Gary O'Neil was unlike the player and the midfielder knows he made a mistake Norwich boss Alex Neil says that the red card received by Gary O'Neil was unlike the player and the midfielder knows he made a mistake The final 15 minutes of the half saw Stoke in control, Walters having the best chance from distance that flew over the crossbar while Arnautovic scuffed a cross in the box that was eventually cleared. It didn't take long for Stoke to get on the scoresheet after the break, with Walters firing home just three minutes after the restart. Arnautovic on the left picked out his teammate at the back post - who had once again evaded his defender - poking home from six yards to give the Potters the lead. But the goal of the game award had to go to Howson for his brilliant equaliser just six minutes later as Vadis Odjidja-Ofoeon controlled Hoolahan's cross on the edge of the box, chesting the ball into the path of his team-mate, who rocketed his shot through a packed box into the top corner. Norwich midfielder Gary O'Neil was sent off for a poor challenge on Ibrahim Afellay The equaliser gave Norwich a second wind, but Stoke were still having the better of the chances as Erik Pieters got away from Nathan Redmond on the left, flashing a cross into the box but no one was there to latch onto it. The Potters were back among the goals not long after, and man-of-the-match Joselu got the plaudits after some brilliant team build-up, with Afellay playing the ball into the path of the striker who hit the ball coolly past a leaping Rudd. There was nearly an instant third for the hosts, with Pieters again causing problems of the left as he whipped in another cross, but Bennett made a vital interception to concede the corner. Howson says his side must turn their attentions to Saturday's game with Bournemouth Howson says his side must turn their attentions to Saturday's game with Bournemouth Norwich could also have had another equaliser, as the impressive Mbokani found Redmond on the edge of the box, but he fired wide of the post. Stoke were pushed all the way by their visitors but they eventually got their third 12 minutes from time and it was another assist for Afellay, as he sweetly struck a free-kick that found the head of Bennett, sending the ball past his own goalkeeper. Peter Crouch entered the fray for the final 10 minutes of the game and he was in the mood for a spectacular goal, forcing a superb save from Rudd as he hit Afellay's incoming corner on the volley and while he was ready to wheel away for the celebration, the Norwich goalkeeper denied him his first Premier League goal of the season. The big striker attempted a bicycle kick a few minutes later but failed to connect, with Cameron Jerome and Redmond both going close for another Norwich goal in the closing stages but the game ended in a comfortable home victory.

The former England striker gave his side a third-minute lead in Wednesday night's Premier League clash before Swansea levelled on 21 minutes courtesy of a Gylfi Sigurdsson penalty. The hosts were then controversially reduced to 10 men as Kyle Naughton was shown a straight red card for a foul on Yann M'Vila. Andre Ayew did put them in front before half-time but Patrick van Aanholt equalised shortly after the break and two more Defoe goals sealed a crucial win for Sam Allardyce's men. Jermain Defoe hit a hat-trick as Sunderland beat Swansea City 4-2 and says sticking to the game plan was key Jermain Defoe hit a hat-trick as Sunderland beat Swansea City 4-2 and says sticking to the game plan was key Sunderland made the perfect start as they capitalised on a poor goal kick from Lukasz Fabianski to take an early lead. The 'keeper drove his kick straight to Adam Johnson, who then found Fabio Borini and when Fabianski fumbled his shot, Defoe was on hand to tap in from close range - although replays showed he may have been offside as Borini shot. Swansea responded well though and Ayew had a decent chance to equalise as he reached a ball over the top but could only shoot over on the half-volley. The next chance fell to Sunderland and Johnson again, the winger somehow skewing the ball wide from six yards after decent build up down the left from the visitors. He was made to rue that miss when Swansea were awarded a penalty in the 20th minute. Ayew had tricked his way past Wes Brown but as he went to shoot, he crumpled and the referee pointed to the spot. Gylfi Sigurdsson had equalised from the spot for Swansea Contact from Brown looked minimal at best but it mattered little to Sigurdsson who calmly finished the penalty, sending Vito Mannone the wrong way. For the next 15 minutes, the game was frenetic, the sides seemingly taking it in turns to attack although neither were able to create any notable chances. However, the game swung in Sunderland's favour eight minutes before half-time as Naughton was given his marching orders by referee Graham Scott. Swansea manager Alan Curtis says the referee got all the major decisions wrong as his side fell to defeat at home to Sunderland Swansea manager Alan Curtis says the referee got all the major decisions wrong as his side fell to defeat at home to Sunderland There appeared to be little in his challenge with M'Vila as he tried to win a bouncing ball but as the French midfielder went down, the referee wasted no time in producing the red card. Swansea were incensed but within three minutes, that anger turned to joy as Ayew put them in front, collecting a long ball from Fabianski before turning Lee Cattermole and hammering a shot low into the far corner. Sunderland boss Sam Allardyce says their win against Swansea gives the team encouragement going forward Sunderland boss Sam Allardyce says their win against Swansea gives the team encouragement going forward The visitors flew out of the traps in the second half and were level within four minutes. Van Aanholt's first touch took him inside Angel Rangel, the full-back on to fill in for the dismissed Naughton, and smashed a right-foot shot off the far post and in - via a sizeable deflection off Federico Fernandez. Jeremain Lens then struck the foot of the post for Sunderland, having been played in by Borini before Defoe put them in front just past the hour mark. Sunderland's players celebrate Defoe's second goal The striker was able to run through unchallenged as the Swansea defence stopped, convinced he was offside. He was, but the flag stayed down and Defoe stroked the ball past Fabianski to put the Black Cats back in front. Alan Curtis' side gave their all to find an equaliser and did have the ball in the back of the net through Rangel, only for it to be correctly ruled out for offside. Defoe wrapped up the three points and sealed his hat-trick as he tapped in Van Aanholt's cross from inside the six-yard box with four minutes remaining to ensure Sunderland move up to 18th and to within a point of Swansea.

In a pulsating Anfield affair that produced four goals in the opening 25 minutes on Wednesday night, Liverpool led twice through two Roberto Firmino goals but were pegged back by Aaron Ramsey and Olivier Giroud. Arsenal's French striker looked to have sealed the points when netting his second on 55 minutes but Allen, who had only been on the pitch for eight minutes, struck as the clock ticked into injury time. Jurgen Klopp says that Liverpool's 3-3 draw with Arsenal will be talked about for a long time Jurgen Klopp says that Liverpool's 3-3 draw with Arsenal will be talked about for a long time The result means Arsenal remain in top spot, but only on goal difference as Leicester beat Tottenham 1-0 at White Hart Lane. With rain and sleet belting down under the Anfield floodlights, this had the makings of a special night and both teams were quickly into their stride. Liverpool pressed the Gunners high up the pitch and their energetic approach yielded maximum reward on nine minutes. Emre Can let fly from range which forced Petr Cech into a diving save. He was only able to parry the ball to Firmino, who steadied himself and buried the ball into the net from 15 yards. Roberto Firmino (right) celebrates scoring Liverpool's first goal against Arsenal with his team-mate Jordon Ibe However, the cheers from the home fans turned to groans just four minutes later as Arsenal equalised with their first real attack. The lively Joel Campbell picked out Ramsey's brilliant run in behind Kolo Toure and Mamadou Sakho, who were both passed fit to play, and the midfielder hammered a shot into the net - beating Simon Mignolet at his near post. Aaron Ramsey celebrates after scoring Arsenal's equaliser Despite clear verbal instructions from the sidelines for both defences to tighten up, the game remained incredibly open and Liverpool were back in front six minutes later. Firmino was the man to grab the goal, one he will not forget in a hurry. He made space for himself about 25 yards out and whipped a wonderful effort into the top corner beyond the outstretched hand of Cech. Roberto Firmino scores Liverpool's first goal against Arsenal A goal like that could have knocked the stuffing out of Arsene Wenger's men but they remained up for the battle and went in search of another equaliser and they got it on 25 minutes. A corner from the left caused confusion at the near post and Giroud nipped in to force the ball towards goal. Mignolet, who was out of position, got his body to the ball but it found its way through and over the line. Arsene Wenger expresses his disappointment in Arsenal's decision making after their 3-3 draw with Liverpool Arsene Wenger expresses his disappointment in Arsenal's decision making after their 3-3 draw with Liverpool Giroud should have made it 3-2 just two minutes later but he somehow contrived to slide the ball away from goal from three yards out with the net at his mercy. Liverpool against Arsenal has seen more hat-tricks than any other fixture in Premier League history [five] and Firmino was inches away from adding his name to that roll of honour on 45 minutes. He collected a cross from Jordon Ibe and looped a half-volley at goal which had Cech beaten but the ball grazed the crossbar and went out for a goal kick. Tony Cottee praises Liverpool for their late equaliser over Arsenal Tony Cottee praises Liverpool for their late equaliser over Arsenal The topsy-turvy nature of the game continued in the second period and Giroud put Arsenal in front for the first time on 53 minutes. Campbell, who was found by a clever reverse ball from Hector Bellerin, pumped the ball into Giroud's feet inside the box. He spun his marker and curled a nonchalant effort into the far corner from 15 yards. Firmino had another chance to claim the match ball on 67 minutes but skewed a header wide of the target after being given the freedom of the Arsenal penalty area. Arsene Wenger reacts after Liverpool's third goal That was the last bit of space afforded to their opposition by Laurent Koscielny and Per Mertesacker until the final few minutes as Liverpool threw caution to the wind, including bringing on new signing Steven Caulker as an emergency striker. This was a game that deserved a dramatic final twist and it delivered the goods.

points for Leicester Robert Huth's late header shocked Tottenham at White Hart Lane and gave Leicester an impressive 1-0 victory in the title race. After 83 minutes of exhilarating Premier League football, with a string of chances for both sides, the Foxes centre-back nodded into the top corner beyond Hugo Lloris after being left unmarked from a corner. Claudio Ranieri is delighted with Leicester's late win over Tottenham Claudio Ranieri is delighted with Leicester's late win over Tottenham The game had looked destined to end in a second stalemate inside four days following their 2-2 draw in the FA Cup on Sunday, with Harry Kane hitting the bar and Leicester seeing three shots blocked on the line. But Huth's effort stunned the home crowd and ended Leicester's run of over five hours without a league goal to move them level with Arsenal at the top of the league. Jamie Vardy is tackled by Ben Davies Both sides made extensive changes from the weekend, with Lloris, Kane and Dele Alli among seven returning players for Spurs, while Leicester changed nine, with Jamie Vardy returning from injury. Spurs dominated the first 15 minutes and both Alli and Christian Eriksen had shots on goal before Kasper Schmeichel tipped a awkward Toby Alderweireld header away from the top corner. Dele Alli shoots at goal during his side's 1-0 defeat to Leicester But Leicester hit back and the dynamic, vibrant combination of Vardy, Shinji Okazaki and Riyad Mahrez caused numerous problems for Tottenham's defenders, with Okazaki exploiting an error from Kyle Walker to shoot just wide of the near post. Lloris had to tip wide Danny Drinkwater's superb first-time volley from distance before Schmeichel pushed wide another Eriksen shot from distance, also at full stretch, before half-time. Mauricio Pochettino gives his reaction to Leicester's late goal to beat Spurs Mauricio Pochettino gives his reaction to Leicester's late goal to beat Spurs Vardy had his best chance when he spun a shot narrowly over the crossbar on 50 minutes but the home side dominated until Huth's goal had them open-mouthed in disbelief with eight minutes remaining. Kane thought he had scored on 61 minutes when he was put through by Erik Lamela and shot low under Schmeichel, but the keeper's ricochet sent the ball at the crossbar before Alli's rebound was blocked on the line. Harry Kane hit the bar late on for Spurs Substitute Leonardo Ulloa and then Drinkwater also had shots blocked before the net by defenders in an intense final 15 minutes but there was not a white shirt close enough to prevent Huth's well-directed header finding the corner and winning the game.

Palace goalkeeper Hennessey made an awful mistake as he managed to let Lescott's header from a corner slip through his hands and over the line just before the hour mark. It was Remi Garde's first win in 11 matches since he took over from Tim Sherwood, ending Villa's run of 19 Premier League games without victory. Palace, however, have now failed to win or score in their last four top-flight games. Lescott (top) celebrates after winning the match against Palace Garde made six changes from the side that could only draw 1-1 at Wycombe in the FA Cup at the weekend, with captain Micah Richards the most notable absentee as he was left on the bench. Goalkeeper Brad Guzan also failed to regain his spot as Mark Bunn continued in goal, and striker Libor Kozak made his first start in more than two years. Idrissa Gueye is chased by James McArthur Despite the changes, it was Palace who got off to the better start and they nearly took the lead after just 42 seconds. Wilfried Zaha played a one-two with Jason Puncheon into the Villa area before taking a touch and curling one onto Bunn's far post.

Garde's side were probably slightly the better but lacked sharpness upfront, which was unsurprising considering it was the first time Kozak had started a Premier League game since Boxing Day 2013. That day, Villa were beaten 1-0 at home by Palace. In fact, the Czech Republic international's only major contribution in the first half was kicking Palace defender Damien Delaney in the face while attempting to acrobatically shoot on the turn. He was lucky to avoid a card of either colour. Remi Garde praised his Villa players' attitude after they narrowly beat Palace Remi Garde praised his Villa players' attitude after they narrowly beat Palace In a game with plenty of endeavour but a lack of real craft in the final third, it was almost inevitable that it would take a howler for the deadlock to be broken. Jordan Veretout swung a corner right onto the head of Lescott in the box, and he should have done far better with his attempt than nod it right into the arms of the keeper. Alan Pardew says Palace's 1-0 loss to Villa was one of their worst performances of the season so far Alan Pardew says Palace's 1-0 loss to Villa was one of their worst performances of the season so far Somehow, though, Hennessey managed to let the ball slip through his hands, wriggle between his legs and crawl behind him over the line, leaving Villa jubilant. Palace took the game back to the home side, but failed to create any real clear-cut chances to get back into it. Villa are still eight points from safety, but the feeling of optimism around Villa Park at full-time will give Garde and his players hope that the greatest of escapes could yet be on.

brilliant brace against Bournemouth West Ham closed in on the Champions League places as Enner Valencia's second-half brace helped beat Bournemouth 3-1 at the Vitality Stadium. The home side had lead at half-time through Harry Arter's first-ever Premier League goal, before the returning Dimitri Payet equalised midway through the second half. And another player making his comeback from injury, Valencia, moved the visitors above Manchester United and to within just a point of Tottenham in the fourth and final Champions League berth with his first goals for the club since February, while the Cherries remain 16th. Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe made 11 changes from the side that won 2-1 at Birmingham City in the FA Cup third round on Saturday, with new £9m signing Benik Afobe making his debut for the club. Mark Noble says the return of Dimitri Payet and Enner Valencia had a massive bearing on West Ham's 3-1 win Mark Noble says the return of Dimitri Payet and Enner Valencia had a massive bearing on West Ham's 3-1 win However, other recent arrivals, Juan Iturbe and Lewis Grabban, had to settle for a place on the substitutes' bench. West Ham, meanwhile, were able to welcome back both Payet and Valencia after recent injury layoffs, the latter after a nine-week absence with an ankle problem. Harry Arter scored his first-ever Premier League goal Slaven Bilic was without the likes of Cheikhou Kouyate - who missed Saturday's win over Wolves in the FA Cup - and Manuel Lanzini, but it was the visitors who could have been ahead straight from the kick-off. A simple ball over the top picked out Michail Antonio's run and after Artur Boruc came out to block the forward, the ball fell nicely to Mark Noble just outside the penalty area. However, with the goal at his mercy, West Ham's captain lifted the ball over the crossbar, before the Hammers suffered a further setback when in-form striker Andy Carroll, who had scored in his previous two league outings, was forced off with a leg injury after just 15 minutes. Slaven Bilic says he's pleased with the character displayed by his West Ham side after they beat Bournemouth Slaven Bilic says he's pleased with the character displayed by his West Ham side after they beat Bournemouth That loss appeared to unbalance the visitors, with their opponents taking an almost immediate advantage by going ahead after 17 minutes through Arter's long-range strike. Picking up possession some 25 yards out in a central position, the midfielder worked himself some space to shoot, before beating Adrian with a well-struck shot which the Spaniard got a good hand to and on reflection should have kept out. Dimitri Payet was on target for the Hammers The home side could, and should, have soon doubled their lead through both Afobe and Charlie Daniels, only for the former to head over from virtually on the goalline, before the latter saw his curling effort beaten away by Adrian. The second half, though, was a much more even contest, with the visitors gradually start to take control of proceedings as Bournemouth appeared to run out of steam. However, Bilic's side still needed a moment of brilliance to draw level after 67 minutes as Payet beat Boruc with a lovely curling free-kick from 25 yards out, albeit with the aid of a slight deflection off the Bournemouth wall. Eddie Howe says his Bournemouth side were not their normal selves in their 3-1 loss at home to West Ham Eddie Howe says his Bournemouth side were not their normal selves in their 3-1 loss at home to West Ham Seven minutes later West Ham had turned the game on its head as Payet wriggled free to the right-hand byline, before picking out Valencia some eight yards out and the Ecuador forward had no problems tapping home. And the visitors' comeback was complete with just six minutes remaining when Valencia beat Boruc at his near post with a clever curling free-kick from the left-hand edge of the penalty area as West Ham stretched their unbeaten run in the Premier League to eight games, their best run in 15 years.

United after a thrilling Premier League contest at St James' Park on Tuesday night. The visitors looked to be in control of the game after an early penalty from Wayne Rooney and Jesse Lingard's 38th-minute goal put them 2-0 ahead. But Georginio Wijnaldum pulled a goal back before half-time and Aleksandar Mitrovic levelled it up with a penalty in the 67th minute. Steve McClaren says he couldn't believe Mike Dean's decision to award Manchester United a penalty in their 3-3 draw with Newcastle Steve McClaren says he couldn't believe Mike Dean's decision to award Manchester United a penalty in their 3-3 draw with Newcastle Rooney looked to have won it for Man Utd when he restored their lead in the 79th minute, but Dummett fired home in the final minute of normal time to ensure a memorable game finished all square. While Newcastle will be buoyed by the late strike, the Red Devils will be disappointed they didn't put the game to bed, with Marouane Fellaini spurning a great chance to make it 4-2 when he headed at Rob Elliot. Wayne Rooney bagged a brace at St James' Park The Belgian started the match ahead of Juan Mata while Fabricio Coloccini and Jack Colback were both included in the Newcastle XI. It was Fellaini who was involved in the opening goal as his header from a corner hit the raised arm of Chancel Mbemba. While Newcastle protested the decision, Rooney stepped up to slot the penalty past Elliot. The goal seemed to knock the confidence of Newcastle, who had not scored in their last four matches, and Fellaini went close to a second when his shot was blocked by Dummett. Rooney then dragged a shot across goal after being played through by Lingard, before Wijnaldum spurned Newcastle's best chance as he shot at David de Gea from Ajoze Perez's cut back. Jesse Lingard celebrates putting the visitors 2-0 ahead Newcastle then had penalty appeals of their own waved away after Lingard appeared to trip Daryl Janmaat in the box. Worse followed for the hosts in the 38th minute as Herrera slid a pass through for Rooney, who laid the ball off for Lingard and he finished past Elliot from a tight angle. Louis van Gaal says Manchester United can only blame themselves for not killing off their 3-3 draw with Newcastle. Louis van Gaal says Manchester United can only blame themselves for not killing off their 3-3 draw with Newcastle. But Newcastle pulled a goal back before the break as Mitrovic headed down for Wijnaldum and he showed fantastic composure to finish with a first-time volley. Newcastle came out with renewed optimism in the second half and went close to an equaliser as De Gea saved from Moussa Sissoko. Georginio Wijnaldum pulled a goal back before half-time Lingard then wasted a good chance at the other end when he had time and space in the box, but shot over the bar. Newcastle were given the chance to level it up when Chris Smalling was penalised for bringing down Mitrovic as the pair grappled at a corner. The striker stepped up and coolly converted the penalty. Aleksandar Mitrovic scored Newcastle's second from the penalty spot The momentum looked to be with Newcastle as they pushed for a winner, but instead it was Rooney who drilled in a fine first-time shot from the edge of the box in the 79th minute to restore the visitors' lead. The visitors had a chance to wrap up the points a few minutes later as Memphis Depay crossed for Fellaini, but he headed at the keeper rather than across him. The miss proved costly as Dummett rescued a late point, firing home a shot from the edge of the box that deflected off Chris Smalling and flew past De Gea.

Oscar opened the scoring on 29 minutes, sliding home after Diego Costa broke clear of the Palace defence and teed him up from six yards. Wilfried Zaha scuffed Palace's best opportunity into the arms of Thibaut Courtois on the hour mark, and Chelsea made the home side pay with two goals in six minutes shortly after. Guus Hiddink was pleased with Chelsea's performance Guus Hiddink was pleased with Chelsea's performance Willian fired a powerful strike into Wayne Hennessey's top corner to make it 2-0 after neat build-up involving Oscar and Cesc Fabregas, before Costa capitalised on strong running from the impressive Willian to tap home at the far post. The only worry for Hiddink will be a groin injury picked up by Eden Hazard, who limped off on 16 minutes, but the win, Chelsea's second away from home in the Premier League this season, moves the Blues up to 14th place. Palace, who were without the injured Yannick Bolasie and suspended Yohan Cabaye, remain seventh after their heaviest league defeat under Alan Pardew. John Terry speaks to Sky Sports after Chelsea's victory over Crystal Palace John Terry speaks to Sky Sports after Chelsea's victory over Crystal Palace Hiddink made two changes from the goalless draw at Old Trafford, bringing back Fabregas and Costa with Nemanja Matic and Pedro dropping to the bench, but the latter was soon required as the Chelsea boss was forced into an early substitution. Hazard, who returned from a hip injury against Watford on Boxing Day, pulled up with a groin problem after a run and shot down the left flank, and the winger will have an MRI scan on Monday. Palace had started the brighter as Kurt Zouma denied an onrushing Fraizer Campbell before Zaha flashed a shot wide of Courtois' post after a poor touch from Hazard. Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew praised Chelsea for their quality Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew praised Chelsea for their quality Chelsea sprang into life just after the change as the lively Oscar picked out Pedro on the left, and the Spain international cut inside only for Joel Ward to block his goal-bound effort. Campbell squandered Palace's clearest chance of the first half after 24 minutes, slicing his half-volley over the bar when unmarked at the back post, and Chelsea punished the miss, taking the lead through Oscar just before the half-hour mark. Damien Delaney failed to cut out Fabregas' through ball for Costa, and the Chelsea striker gathered before cutting back for Oscar for a simple tap-in from six yards. Joel Ward battles for the ball with John Obi Mikel in difficult conditions The Blues had the chance to double their lead 10 minutes before the break as Cesar Azpilicueta took a cross-field pass from Oscar on his chest, but Hennessey stood tall to beat clear the Spaniard's powerful strike. Having ended the first half on top, Chelsea remained on the front foot to start the second, and should have gone two ahead through Zouma eight minutes after the restart. The defender found himself free at the far post and met Willian's free-kick with power, but headed over the bar from close range. In the end it did not matter, though, as Chelsea put the game beyond the Eagles with two quick-fire goals. Willian struck first, doubling the lead with a first-time blast that gave Hennessey no chance. Terry and his Chelsea team-mates applaud the fans That came shortly after Zaha had wasted a good opportunity to level the score, but the Palace winger mistimed his shot after Campbell put him through. That proved costly as Costa added the third in the 66th minute following more excellent work from Willian. The Chelsea midfielder turned James McArthur inside out, before sliding a low shot across the face of goal that Hennessey could only palm into the path of the Chelsea striker. Palace struggled all afternoon to live with a Chelsea attack that looked back to its best, and Scott Dann was booked for a crude challenge on Costa with 10 minutes to play. Speaking on Super Sunday, both Graeme Souness and Jamie Carragher said Chelsea's Diego Costa should remain aggressive Speaking on Super Sunday, both Graeme Souness and Jamie Carragher said Chelsea's Diego Costa should remain aggressive Willian fed Costa at the back post as the Blues pushed for a fourth late on, but the Spain forward blazed a difficult left-foot volley into the stands. The win, Chelsea's first on the road since late August, continues their recent upturn in form. They face Scunthorpe next in the FA Cup before resuming league action against West Brom at Stamford Bridge. As for Palace, the defeat marks their third successive game without a goal, and Pardew will be looking for improvement against Southampton in the FA Cup before they face bottom-of-the-table Aston Villa at Villa Park on January 12.

Goodison Park on Sunday. The 19-year-old midfielder equalised in first half stoppage-time after Aaron Lennon had given the Blues the lead against his former club. Alli's goal came at the end of a half dominated by the visitors as they hit the woodwork either side of Lennon's opener. Aaron Lennon scored his first home goal for Everton against old club Tottenham Aaron Lennon scored his first home goal for Everton against old club Tottenham Spurs were quickly onto the front foot and had already threatened Tim Howard's goal twice before Harry Kane struck the inside of the post in the ninth minute. The England striker collected the ball in the inside right channel and unleashed a low shot that skidded off the greasy surface and onto the post before spinning behind for a goal kick. Dele Alli impressed Graeme Souness and Jamie Carragher after his man-of-the-match performance for Tottenham Dele Alli impressed Graeme Souness and Jamie Carragher after his man-of-the-match performance for Tottenham The visitors continued to dominate as Everton struggled to cope against the suffocating Tottenham press. So it came as a shock when Lennon put the Blues in front midway through the half. The former Spurs winger fired a half-volley into the far corner after Romelu Lukaku had nodded Tom Cleverley's long ball into his path. Aaron Lennon put Everton in front midway through the first half It all came from Leighton Baines winning the ball back in Spurs' territory and Everton looked to keep up that intensity in the minutes after the goal. Lennon was again involved, beating his man down the right before cutting the ball back from Arouna Kone, whose shot was blocked. Kyle Walker (right) heads the ball under pressure from Arouna Kone The Toffees were soon on the back foot again though as Spurs regained their composure. Indeed, they were almost level just before the half hour as Ben Davies rattled the crossbar. Having drawn all the Everton defenders towards goal, Christian Eriksen played his corner low to the edge of the box to Davies, who was able to take a touch before hammering his effort goalwards only to see it crash back off the bar with Howard able only to wave at it on its way past. Roberto Martinez was full of praise for his Everton side after the match Roberto Martinez was full of praise for his Everton side after the match Spurs continued to dominate possession but their threat seemed to diminish as the half went on. However, just as it seemed they would go in a goal down, they equalised. Alli was the scorer, making a diagonal run in from the left before chesting down Toby Alderweireld's long pass and volleying low past Howard. Mauricio Pochettino said his players were feeling a little sad not to win Mauricio Pochettino said his players were feeling a little sad not to win Although Everton began the second half well, it was Tottenham who created the first opening. Davies burst down the left before switching the ball to Alli. The young midfielder chested it first time into the path of Kane but the ball would not drop for the Spurs No 10 and he sliced his shot wide under pressure from John Stones. It was an altogether more even contest though and the introduction of Muhamed Besic and Gerard Deulofeu saw Everton step up their game further - Besic adding bite and drive to the Everton midfield while Deulofeu was a constant menace down the right. Dele Alli felt unlucky not to walk away with all three points Dele Alli felt unlucky not to walk away with all three points While the game continued to flow and both sides looked to get on the front foot, clear cut chances were at a premium. Deulofeu had a shot blocked at one end before Alli tested Howard with a shot from 25 yards. Of greater concern to Everton though was Erik Lamela's clipped free-kick that Howard flapped at, briefly giving Spurs hope of a gift before the home defence scrambled it clear. Seamus Coleman (left) battles for the ball with Erik Lamela Besic then drew a top save from Hugo Lloris with a dipping volley from the edge of area, with Ramiro Funes Mori heading just wide from the resulting corner. Everton looked the more likely to grab a late winner with Lukaku firing over under pressure from Jan Vertonghen before the same defender blocked his effort in added time. Lloris denied Ross Barkley's follow up.

Two headed goals, the first from Michail Antonio after just 10 minutes and Carroll's powerful effort in the 55th minute, secured all three points for the Hammers. Liverpool mustered 23 shots, but tellingly just one of them was on target as Jurgen Klopp's men were unable to find a way past Adrian, despite hitting the crossbar and having an effort cleared off the line with 13 minutes remaining. Carroll and Mark Noble embrace after West Ham's second The result moved the Hammers above Liverpool in the Premier League and up to sixth place, with Klopp once again left with plenty to ponder after another disappointing display. Dimitri Payet made his first league appearance since the start of November, coming on as a substitute in the 64th minute, but a concern for Slaven Bilic will be an injury to Manuel Lanzini who was forced off six minutes before the end of the first half. West Ham made a blistering start to the game and Antonio opened the scoring with a back-post header. The winger appeared to foul Alberto Moreno deep in the West Ham half but, after helping his side win back possession, burst forward and rose above Nathaniel Clyne to nod in from six yards. Carroll wins a header against Liverpool's Mamadou Sakho Eight minutes later, Lanzini's vicious, swerving effort from 20 yards out crashed against the woodwork as Bilic's men came close to adding a quick-fire second. Liverpool were seeing more of the ball but West Ham continued to cause the visitors problems, with Aaron Cresswell's deflected shot forcing Simon Mignolet to save at his near post. For all their lacklustre play, Liverpool were inches away from equalising with their only meaningful effort of the half, as Emre Can's curling shot came back off crossbar just before the interval. Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp smiles on the touchline Liverpool played with far more purpose after the break. Philippe Coutinho fizzed a shot over before Moreno's low cross found Christian Benteke, only for the striker to miss his kick in front of goal. Nothing materialised from all the Reds' endeavours, and they were caught out by their former £35m signing Carroll, 10 minutes into the second period. Mark Noble swung a brilliant cross in from the Hammers' right and Carroll out-jumped Clyne to crash his header home, leaving Mignolet with no chance. Antonio (left) celebrates with Carroll and Aaron Cresswell Carroll had scored the winner against Southampton on Monday and his third of the season gave the Hammers breathing space, although he could have extended that advantage further had it not been for a brilliant point-blank save from Mignolet on 69 minutes. West Ham spent much of the remainder of the second half on the defensive, though, and Lucas' low header in the 77th minute was cleared off the line by Noble before Joe Allen missed a golden opportunity to score in the 90th minute. But the game was already out of Liverpool's reach by that point, as West Ham notched their first back-to-back wins since mid-October, while Liverpool's top four aspirations were dealt a huge blow.

Newcastle, who paid tribute to former goalkeeper Pavel Srnicek by wearing special t-shirts before the game following his death earlier this week, were much the better side in the first half and could have been ahead just before the break but for a superb stop from Petr Cech to deny Georginio Wijnaldum. The visitors kept threatening after the break and Arsene Wenger's side needed Cech to keep out Wijnaldum again before they finally broke the deadlock in the 72nd minute thanks to Laurent Koscielny's close range strike. Newcastle players wore special t-shirts to remember Pavel Srnicek Newcastle players wore special t-shirts to remember Pavel Srnicek Steve McClaren's side continued to be wasteful in front of goal as Aleksandar Mitrovic and Dutchman Wijnaldum missed the target with headers and it proved costly as the Gunners held on to start 2016 with a victory to move clear of nearest challengers Leicester, who drew with Bournemouth, at the top. After a moment's applause in memory of Srnicek it was the league leaders who came flying out of the traps with Hector Bellerin, who was in acres of space down the right, pulling the ball back for Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, but the England forward could not make clean contact with his shot. The visitors held firm amid the Arsenal onslaught in the opening 20 minutes and gradually came into the game with first Wijnaldum, and then Jack Colback, testing Cech in quick succession. Arsenal defender Koscielny spoke after netting the only goal of the game Arsenal defender Koscielny spoke after netting the only goal of the game McClaren's side grew in confidence and their performance was silencing the home crowd as Perez flashed a shot across goal in the 25th minute. Arsenal looked flat but they nearly broke the deadlock when Oxlade-Chamberlain's pass released Olivier Giroud into the box, but the Frenchman's shot was well blocked by Fabricio Coloccini. However, that was a rare bright spot for the Gunners, who needed Cech to keep them on level terms just before the break. Aaron Ramsey and Daryl Janmaat compete for the ball The Czech Republic international, who broke the Premier League clean sheet record following Arsenal's 2-0 win over Bournemouth last Monday, kept out Mitrovic's over-head kick, before racing off his line to block Wijnaldum's low strike. Cech was back in action shortly after the break and this time Wijnaldum was put clean through, but again the goalkeeper was quickly off his line to deny him. Arsenal were coming under serious pressure but the visitors continued to miss chances as Mitrovic turned over Perez's cross from five yards out. Newcastle manager Steve McClaren believes his side 'controlled the game' Newcastle manager Steve McClaren believes his side 'controlled the game' The home side responded five minutes after the interval but Aaron Ramsey could not beat Rob Elliot in the Newcastle goal as the frustration continued to build for Wenger and the home faithful. Newcastle kept creating the better chances but they just could not find the target with Chancel Mbemba heading well over the bar from the centre of the area. And with just over five minutes remaining the missed opportunities came back to haunt McClaren and his side as Koscielny latched onto Giroud's header to tap home from close range. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger says his side showed the 'mental qualities' needed to beat Newcastle 1-0 at the Emirates, thanks to a Laurent Koscielny goal. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger says his side showed the 'mental qualities' needed to beat Newcastle 1-0 at the Emirates, thanks to a Laurent Koscielny goal. Despite going behind, Newcastle still pushed on in search of an equaliser but they continued to be wasteful with Mitrovic and Wijnaldum both missing the target with headers. At the other end Ramsey and Mesut Ozil both missed good opportunities to finish the game off but they were not costly as Arsenal started the year with a crucial three points. Soccer Saturday verdict - Matt Le Tissier Arsenal were very fortunate today. This will be one of those performances they may look back on at the end of the season, if they do go on and win the title, as a key result because they were nowhere near their best.

Newcastle were very good and deserved at least a point. They had some very good chances this afternoon, and they couldn't take any of them and in the end they got punished. When the opportunity came along for the Gunners, though, Laurent Koscielny was far more clinical than any of the Newcastle forwards.

Riyad Mahrez saw his 59th-minute spot-kick saved after referee Andre Marriner had sent off Francis for his last-ditch challenge on Jamie Vardy as the striker advanced on goal. Vardy had earlier hit the post but the Cherries had chances to score too, notably through Josh King's first-half header, before they resorted to an ultra-defensive mentality when reduced to 10 men. Eddie Howe believes Leicester were wrongly awarded a penalty Eddie Howe believes Leicester were wrongly awarded a penalty Leicester have now failed to score in three Premier League games, and this 0-0 stalemate means Arsenal, who beat Newcastle United 1-0, have now opened up a two-point gap at the top of the Premier League. The Foxes remain in the top four by a healthy margin of seven points to fifth-placed Manchester United but will feel aggrieved they did not keep pace with Arsenal in a match in which they had a man advantage for more than half an hour. Francis is shown a red card by referee Andre Marriner That they did not win was a result of a superb defensive performance by the visitors, who were solid and disciplined in their shape after Francis' dismissal, and actually limited Leicester to fewer chances than when the contest was 11 against 11. With the sides level, Marc Albrighton found Mahrez with a deep cross after nine minutes which the Algerian - in the flamboyant style which has become his trademark this season - diverted over the bar with an acrobatic scissor-kick. Artur Boruc saved a Riyad Mahrez penalty to earn Bournemouth a point Artur Boruc saved a Riyad Mahrez penalty to earn Bournemouth a point King then should have done much better with a free header from 10 yards, having timed his run between Wes Morgan and Robert Huth to perfection to meet the ball after it was intelligently kept in play by a stretching Junior Stanislas on the left wing. Vardy struck the post after collecting a scuffed effort from Leonardo Ulloa and Dan Gosling then filed his entry for the miss of the match with a skied effort after he had been picked out by King from the right flank. Riyad Mahrez had this penalty kick saved by Artur Boruc Ulloa was replaced by Nathan Dyer at half-time, to facilitate the switch of Mahrez to a more central position, but the game's complexion was changed completely by the sending-off and he often found space limited by an overloaded Bournemouth defence. Leicester had long spells of possession but were lacking in their final ball - a multi-pass move that ended with a hurried ball into the box which N'Golo Kante barely got a toe to as it squirmed wide of goal - and the visitors sealed off the pockets of space which flair players such as Mahrez like to find. Bournemouth deserve credit for limiting the division's joint-highest goalscorers to such slim pickings while Leicester have 11 days in which to sharpen their attacking instincts before their next Premier League game, at Tottenham.

After a goalless first half, Anthony Martial put United ahead in the 47th minute when he clinically headed home from Ashley Young's cross. It looked like being another frustrating afternoon for the hosts when Swansea equalised with 20 minutes to go through Gylfi Sigurdsson. Gylfi Sigurdsson headed in the equaliser for Swansea But Wayne Rooney restored the lead when he cleverly flicked in Martial's cross to end his two-month wait for a goal and become the second-highest scorer in both Premier League and Manchester United history. Swansea went close to an equaliser with the last action of the match as goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski incredibly headed narrowly wide, but United held on for their first win since November 21, which relieves some of the pressure on manager Louis van Gaal. Louis van Gaal was pleased his risky tactics paid off Louis van Gaal was pleased his risky tactics paid off The Dutchman made just the one change from the draw with Chelsea as Phil Jones came in for Matteo Darmian, while only four Swansea players kept their place from their stalemate with Crystal Palace. Jonjo Shelvey, who started against Palace, did not make the squad amid speculation that he could leave in January. The deadlock was almost broken inside the opening minute as Swansea made a mess of clearing their lines and Ander Herrera had a shot blocked from inside the box. Rooney challenges with Leon Britton for the ball United dominated possession in the early stages but were unable to get the goal to lift a flat atmosphere. Rooney shot into the side netting and then headed into the ground from Young's cross while Neil Taylor did well to block an effort from Juan Mata after a quickly-taken free-kick. As United continued to labour, Swansea settled and had appeals for a penalty turned down when a cross hit Morgan Schneiderlin's boot and bounced up onto his hand. Neil Taylor holds off Ashley Young Young looked United's best outlet on the right and he fashioned chances for Mata and Rooney that were both saved by Fabianski. Jones was replaced by Darmian at the break and again United came out of the blocks quickly, this time getting the opening goal as Young crossed from the right, after excellent work from Bastian Schweinsteiger, for Martial to head home. Bastian Schweinsteiger was pleased with Manchester United's character Bastian Schweinsteiger was pleased with Manchester United's character United continued to apply pressure but were almost pegged back as Sigurdsson clipped a ball over the defence and Andre Ayew headed against the post. The introduction of Modou Barrow gave Swansea added pace down the flank and it was the substitute who crossed for Sigurdsson to cleverly head past David de Gea after 70 minutes. Wayne Rooney notched his 188th Premier League goal Swansea had won the last three meetings against United by a 2-1 scoreline but the hosts soon restored their lead as Martial burst away down the left and Rooney turned in his low cross with a clever flick. The goal was Rooney's 188th in the Premier League and means only Alan Shearer on 260 is ahead of him in the standings. Swansea pushed for an equaliser in injury-time and came close as Ashley Williams had a shot pushed wide and then Fabianski headed just past the post with the last action. Paul Merson's Soccer Saturday verdict \"Manchester United did well in patches. It wasn't a 90-minute performance by any means. \"Ashley Young was the best player on the pitch, and he put a great ball in at the start of the second half to Martial. You were thinking United would go on then and win easily, but they didn't. \"They let Swansea back in the game and Sigurdsson scored a brilliant header, but what a goal from Wayne Rooney. Cometh the hour, cometh the man. Paul Merson looks back at Manchester United's 2-1 win over Swansea Paul Merson looks back at Manchester United's 2-1 win over Swansea \"Then, the last kick of the game, the goalkeeper comes up for Swansea. It was like a Bob Latchford header, he rises up and it went inches past the post. Fabianski really got up like a centre-forward, it wasn't a glancing header, and another day that goes in, but it's a big win for United. \"Rooney played quite well and he was always involved. If United can get Rooney playing well they'll get in the top four. If they don't, they won't.\" Player ratings Man Utd: De Gea (6), Young (8), Jones (5), Smalling (6), Blind (5), Schneiderlin (5), Schweinsteiger (6), Mata (6), Herrera (6), Martial (8), Rooney (7).

The hosts looked fairly uninspired for much of a damp and drizzly afternoon, but the match turned when visiting midfielder Victor Wanyama was red carded after foolishly picking up a second booking. Clearly buoyed by the dismissal, Norwich began to press, and they scored the only goal of the game moments later, with Tettey finding the top corner after good work from impressive sub Vadis Odjidja-Ofoe. Tettey found the top corner with a first-time left-footed shot It was a second win in a row for the Canaries and they are now six points clear of the drop zone, just a point behind Southampton, who continue to struggle on their travels. The Saints began the match with Sadio Mane on the bench, the lively forward punished by boss Ronald Koeman for his late arrival at a team meeting. Even without the Senegal international, the Saints shaded the first-half, but Shane Long could not convert their best opportunities. Alex Tettey (right) and Vadis Odjidja-Ofoe combined for the winning goal Having latched onto a lovely pass from Cuco Martina, the forward possibly dallied too long over his shot, and Declan Rudd came rushing out to pull off a decent save. Moments later, Long met a set-piece with a powerful downward header, but Rudd rose to the task again and diverted the ball over the bar. At the other end, Jonny Howson volleyed wide after a bad header from Jose Fonte sent him through on goal, and the Norwich man then picked the wrong option after a Virgil van Dijk blunder, sending a pass through the box when a shot looked the better option. Alex Neil says he is looking to add to his squad as soon as possible Alex Neil says he is looking to add to his squad as soon as possible The Canaries began the second-half brightly but chances remained thin on the ground. Dusan Tadic shot over from a tough angle at the other end for Southampton, who looked firmly on course for at least a point, until shooting themselves in the foot with 18 minutes left. Having been booked in the first-half for a late tackle on Nathan Redmond, Wanyama dived in recklessly to foul Odjidja-Ofoe and there was never much doubt that referee Mark Clattenburg would reach for a second yellow. Norwich sensed three points were now there for the taking and Odjidja-Ofoe then came up trumps, skilfully eluding Jordy Clasie down the right before cleverly cutting the ball back to Tettey, who finished really well, calmly sweeping a first-time shot into the top corner. Ronald Koeman was left angry at the unprofessional behaviour of Sadio Mane Ronald Koeman was left angry at the unprofessional behaviour of Sadio Mane Having taken the lead, the hosts then retreated into their shell somewhat, and the home fans had to endure a somewhat tense final 10 minutes although, despite the arrival of Mane from the bench, Southampton failed to seriously threaten Rudd's goal. The Saints defeated leaders Arsenal 4-0 last week but two away defeats in a row have taken some of the gloss off that win, but the mood is more upbeat at Norwich and the Canaries look very credible candidates to secure another season in the top flight.

The centre-back was on hand to tap in from a couple of yards out following a scramble in the Stoke box, after Jon Walters looked to have earned his side a point inside the final 10 minutes. Stephane Sessegnon had put Albion ahead on the hour mark, while Stoke were reduced to 10 men just two minutes after drawing level, with Geoff Cameron given his marching orders for raising his hands to Claudio Yacob. The game started brightly, with West Brom getting into Stoke territory and Chris Brunt whipping in a cross that just eluded Rickie Lambert in the opening minute. At the other end, Cameron fired in a powerful goal-bound effort that needed blocking after Albion failed to clear a Stoke corner. Set pieces looked like West Brom's likeliest way to goal and, from one of a number of decent Brunt deliveries, Evans got himself free, only to find himself underneath the ball and unable to direct his header on target. The same two players were involved as West Brom created the first clear opening of the match. Brunt's corner was flicked on for Evans, but the defender could only poke it wide on the stretch from close range. Stephane Sessegnon gave Albion the lead in the second half Stoke were beginning to gain the upper hand, though, and Glen Johnson forced Boaz Myhill into action with a well-struck shot from the edge of the box, having cut in from the right. The visitors nearly broke the deadlock just before the half hour as Xherdan Shaqiri cut in from the right to pick out the diagonal run of Marko Arnautovic from the left, only for the latter to scuff his shot. The best chance of the half, though, fell to West Brom. Another free-kick from Brunt was only half-cleared, allowing Sessegnon the space to take a touch and roll the ball back across the box. It came to Darren Fletcher 12 yards out, but, under little pressure, the former Manchester United midfielder fired over. Stoke started the second half the better, though, and Shaqiri should have put them ahead after a fine passing move. Arnautovic eventually teeing him up with a wonderful back-heel, but his shot from eight yards dribbled wide. It was another move of real quality that saw the Baggies take the lead. Fletcher drove from inside his own half before finding James Morrison in a pocket of space 30 yards out. The midfielder took a touch before threading a pass perfectly into the path of Sessegnon, who lashed the ball high past Jack Butland and into the net. The goal lifted Tony Pulis' side and they looked far likelier to add a second than Stoke did to find an equaliser in the minutes that followed. However, they were unable to fashion any real openings and, with nine minutes remaining, Stoke struck. Walters appeared to be coming back from an offside position as he flicked on Butland's goal-kick to fellow substitute Joselu. The flag stayed down, though, and Joselu delivered a beautiful ball with the outside of his right foot, allowing Walters to arrive right on cue to head home from six yards. The momentum was with the away side, but their hopes of kicking on and finding a winning goal were dashed as Cameron was shown red after an altercation with Yacob. The American looked to shove the Baggies midfielder, who immediately went to ground, but there was very little in it and Cameron looked shocked went Lee Mason produced the red card. With Stoke down to 10, West Brom themselves were able to push on and grabbed the winner in the third minute of added time. Stoke were unable to clear from a corner and, after ricocheting around the area, the ball eventually fell to Evans, who tapped in to spark jubilant scenes at The Hawthorns.

Goals from Yaya Toure (82) and Sergio Aguero (84) overcame a spirited Watford side who looked on course for victory when Aleksandar Kolarov deflected Ben Watson's corner beyond the stricken Joe Hart on 55 minutes. The result - City's first away win since September - moves Manuel Pellegrini's side up to third in the table, three points behind Premier League leaders Arsenal Watford, meanwhile, remain ninth in the table having slipped to a second consecutive defeat for the first time since November. Pellegrini named an unchanged side for the first time since August as City travelled to Hertfordshire looking to keep pace at the top of the Premier League. Arsenal's victory over Newcastle earlier on Saturday meant City started the game six points adrift of the leaders, but that did little to inspire the visitors as Watford's prolific strike force tormented a tentative City defence. Man City manager Manuel Pellegrini praised his side for keeping their cool Man City manager Manuel Pellegrini praised his side for keeping their cool Troy Deeney pounced on an error by Eliaquim Mangala to put Odion Ighalo through on goal on 10 minutes, only for Nicholas Otamendi to save his defensive partner with a last-gasp block. Ighalo then created a chance on his own three minutes later, leaving Otamendi for dead in the area with a sublime piece of skill, but Hart was on hand to thwart the Nigerian's shot. City struggled to penetrate Watford's well-drilled defensive unit, with the visitors limited to long-range efforts as Kevin de Bruyne's dipping shot drew Heurelho Gomes into an awkward save on 19 minutes. Quique Sanchez Flores says defeat is hard to take Quique Sanchez Flores says defeat is hard to take Mangala continued to struggle with Ighalo as the Watford striker toyed with the Frenchman. But, for all their defensive difficulties, City began to grow into the game, with Raheem Sterling missing a glaring opportunity to break the deadlock on 29 minutes with the goal gaping. Allan Nyom was booked for simulation after theatrically going to ground in the area under after Fernandinho's challenge as the first half ended in timid fashion. But Watford sprung out of the traps after the break, with Watson drawing Hart into a low save with just two minutes on the clock, before Fernandinho spurned another great chance for the visitors, sending a free header over the bar on 54 minutes. Ben Watson celebrates after his corner found its way into the net And that miss proved to be costly as Watford opened the scoring within a minute. Mangala was forced to concede a corner and Watson's wicked near-post delivery forced Kolarov to glance the ball beyond Hart, who was committed to a punched clearance. Watford could have wrapped up the points when Etienne Capoue, having bundled his way into the City area, scooped the ball over the target on 79 minutes. And that missed, coupled with a tactical gamble from Pellegrini, swung the game dramatically in City's favour. Yaya Toure celebrates with Aleksandar Kolarov The introduction of Wilfried Bony, on for Mangala, gave City added presence up front and it paid off and Toure was left with enough space to beat his marker to volley Kolarov's corner home eight minutes from time. The turnaround was completed just two minutes and 36 seconds later as Bacary Sagna's exquisite cross from the right was expertly headed beyond Gomes by Aguero, sealing the win as City maintained their quest for a third Premier League title.

Leicester City moved level on points with Arsenal at the top of the Premier League table after holding Manchester City to a 0-0 draw at the King Power Stadium. With Sergio Aguero back in Manuel Pellegrini's starting line-up, the visitors dominated possession during the early moments but struggled to create clear-cut opportunities from their patient build-up play. Raheem Sterling forced three smart saves from Kasper Schmeichel during the first half, with the hosts' best chance coming when Jamie Vardy blazed over from the edge of the area. Chances were few and far between during the second period for both sides, with the hosts' resolute defending seeing the game end in a stalemate. Leicester finish 2015 in second place in the table, behind Arsenal on goal difference, while City move above Tottenham into third. Kasper Schmeichel is called into action to deny Sterling City dominated the ball in the opening exchanges. Sterling looked lively throughout and created their first chance on 18 minutes when he burst clear of Robert Huth and cut back for Kevin De Bruyne, whose curling effort from just inside the area was palmed away by Schmeichel. The visitors continued to press forward, with Aguero seeing an effort charged down and Sterling having a volley palmed away by Schmeichel, before the Leicester keeper was called into action again to claw Sterling's left-footed strike over the bar. Leicester, making two changes from their Boxing Day defeat at Liverpool, appeared second-best through large periods of the first half but created two chances in quick succession just before the interval. Eliaquim Mangala and Nicolas Otamendi chase down Jamie Vardy First Christian Fuchs' dangerous cross just evaded Marc Albrighton at the far post, before Vardy blazed over moments later after Eliaquim Mangala gave the ball away just outside the City area. The away side came out of the blocks quickly after the break, with Aguero and Yaya Toure both having efforts charged down after Sterling's clever flick from inside a congested area. Claudio Ranieri's side showed more attacking threat after the restart, as N'Golo Kante's dipping effort from distance flew just wide of Joe Hart's near post and Albrighton dragged his effort wide following Riyad Mahrez's defence-splitting pass. Sergio Aguero looked far from impressed when he was replaced just after the hour mark Sergio Aguero looked far from impressed when he was replaced just after the hour mark The visitors introduced Wilfried Bony in place of Aguero, who fired over Aleksandar Kolarov's low cross after Nicolas Otamendi's downward header had been pushed away by Schmeichel. Vardy had an effort from a tight angle held by Hart, before Fuchs' powerful effort for Mahrez's short free-kick soon after again called the City keeper in to action. Neither keeper had a save of note to make in the closing stages, as Leicester finished strongly to earn a deserved point.

Patrick Bamford and Wilfried Zaha had opportunities to break the deadlock in a game short on chances, while Wayne Hennessey saved superbly from Gylfi Sigurdsson's free-kick. But Swansea dug in to claim a point that keeps them only hovering a place above the relegation zone, while Palace stay fifth place on 31 points. Swansea caretaker manager Alan Curtis made eight changes after the Swans' win over West Brom on Saturday, with Lukas Fabianski, Ashley Williams and Neil Taylor the only survivors. Pardew brought in Yohan Cabaye, Mile Jedinak, Brede Hangeland and Marouane Chamakh and it was his side who settled into their rhythm quickly. Wilfried Zaha was a threat for Crystal Palace all afternoon Zaha looked to attack Swansea full-back Taylor from the start and the winger - who was making his 199th appearance for the club - was Palace's brightest spark in what was a dull first half. The best chance of the opening 45 minutes came when Shelvey's defence-splitting pass freed Marvin Emnes, but the former Middlesbrough striker was beaten to the ball by the alert Wayne Hennessey. Ashley Williams believes Swansea are starting to show stability Ashley Williams believes Swansea are starting to show stability Bamford was sent on for the ineffectual Chamakh, but it was the unlikely figure of defender Brede Hangeland who almost put Palace ahead, flicking a Cabaye free-kick towards the Swansea back post, only to be denied by a stunning one-handed stop by Fabianski. Williams defended resolutely for the visitors and showed his agility when intervening to stop a Jason Puncheon destined for the emerging Bamford at the back post. Jack Cork of Swansea City and Yohan Cabaye (left) of Crystal Palace argue at Selhurst Park Bamford, who has failed to score in his last 12 appearances, was gifted an opportunity on 75 minutes when the ball bounced kindly into his path amid a scrum of players in the Swansea area. But the striker's effort was thumped directly at Fabianski, who palmed the ball away from danger. Alan Pardew believes Crystal Palace had clear opportunities to win in their 0-0 draw against Swansea Alan Pardew believes Crystal Palace had clear opportunities to win in their 0-0 draw against Swansea Palace continued to press and were inches away from all three points when Zaha cut onto his right, but his curling shot bent agonisingly side. Swansea then threatened to go back to Wales with maximum points as Sigurdsson looked to wrong-foot Hennessey with a free-kick from 25 yards, but the Swansea goalkeeper was able to adjust his feet and get across to his left and palm clear. Alan Curtis praised his entire squad and picked out Ashley Williams as the stand out performer Alan Curtis praised his entire squad and picked out Ashley Williams as the stand out performer Paul Walsh's Soccer Saturday verdict \"(Palace) do need someone at that end of the pitch who can finish games off for them. They created chances and were the better team in the first half - it wasn't a classic by a long way. \"There were very few chances in the first half. It did improve in the second, but the wide players - in goalscoring positions - should do better. \"I can't believe how many long balls Swansea played in the first half. They looked really nervous, and kept on lumping it out from the back - which is unlike Swansea. \"They brought on Ki and Sigurdsson, and then played with much more composure. They created better chances for themselves and looked a better team, but I think Alan Curtis will be pleased with a point.\" Player ratings Crystal Palace: Hennessey (7), Ward (6), Dann (6), Hangeland

stoppage-time penalty to earn Stoke a 4-3 victory over Everton in a thrilling encounter at Goodison Park. Xherdan Shaqiri twice put Stoke ahead in the first half, only for Romelu Lukaku to cancel out both strikes with two of his own either side of the break. But though Gerard Deulofeu put the hosts in front for the first time in the match in the 71st minute, substitute Joselu brought the sides level with 10 minutes remaining, before Arnautovic sealed a dramatic win from the spot after being brought down by John Stones. Victory for Stoke lifts them into ninth place in the Premier League, while Everton drop two places to eleventh. Stoke's Xherdan Shaqiri netted twice in the win over the Toffees Stoke, coming off the back of their 2-0 Boxing Day win over Manchester United, were looking to record their third successive league victory over Everton and started well with Shaqiri, Bojan and Arnautovic proving a handful for the hosts. Stoke manager Mark Hughes had urged winger Arnautovic to \"shoot more\" following his outstanding strike in the victory over United and the Austrian international nearly grabbed his seventh goal of the season in the opening stages, but fired just wide of the post following good work from Bojan. Xherdan Shaqiri hailed Stoke's 'important victory' Xherdan Shaqiri hailed Stoke's 'important victory' Stoke had lost just one of their previous six matches away from the Britannia Stadium - a 2-0 defeat at relegation-threatened Sunderland - and showed why they have been so impressive on the road, scoring a superb opening goal in the 16th minute Bojan evaded two Everton challenges before slipping a ball through to Arnautovic, who immediately found the incoming Shaqiri and the Switzerland international guided his effort into the bottom corner of the net. Joselu brought Stoke level with 10 minutes remaning Everton, who also tasted victory on Boxing Day, beating Newcastle 1-0, burst into life following Stoke's opener and were back level within six minutes courtesy of the in-form Lukaku. Lukaku had scored six goals in his last six league appearances at Goodison Park and he continued his fine form on home soil, firing past Jack Butland after a superb exchange of passes between Ross Barkley and James McCarthy. However, Stoke regained the lead just before the half-time interval in stunning fashion as Shaqiri doubled his tally for the afternoon by collecting Bojan's cross field pass before scooping the ball over a helpless Tim Howard. Everton started the second-half with renewed vigour and restored parity in the 64th minute through Lukaku's 15th Premier League goal of the season. Stoke manager Mark Hughes says his side's 4-3 win against Everton was a huge result Stoke manager Mark Hughes says his side's 4-3 win against Everton was a huge result Tom Cleverley's superb 40-yard pass opened up the Stoke defence and found Lukaku, who controlled the ball expertly on his chest before firing beyond Butland. Everton continued to press and took the lead for the first time in the match seven minutes later as Deulofeu ghosted into the six-yard box to tap home following great work from Steven Naismith and Barkley. Roberto Martinez says the penalty awarded to Stoke in his side's 4-3 defeat was sickening Roberto Martinez says the penalty awarded to Stoke in his side's 4-3 defeat was sickening However, Stoke refused to accept defeat and drew level with 10 minutes remaining through substitute Joselu. Howard failed to deal with an excellent cross from the left from Arnautovic and Joselu was on hand to rifle his effort into the back of the net. Arnautovic then kept his cool from the penalty spot in stoppage-time after being brought down by Stones to ensure Stoke came out of this topsy-turvy affair with all three points. Paul Merson's Soccer Saturday verdict \"There was some great football. It was a pleasure to watch the game. I would worry for Everton - they get on top of games, but don't have that killer instinct. \"When it's 3-2, you think it's game over - you think Everton are going to win by four or maybe five. But (Stoke) are so dangerous on the break. They've got footballers in the team who see a pass, and have great movement. \"They were absolutely outstanding today - Everton were as well, but they keep on letting in goals. \"(Roberto) Martinez plays exactly the way he did at Wigan - 'We're going to score more goals than you.' He was letting in goals left, right and centre at Wigan, and he seems to have brought that to Everton. It's great for the neutral, but if you were a home fan you'd be pulling your hair out.\" Player ratings Everton: Howard (5), Galloway (6), Funes Mori (5), Stones (5), Coleman (6), Barry (5), McCarthy (5), Deulofeu (6), Kone (5), Barkley (6), Lukaku (7).

Howson and Dieumerci Mbokani were enough to give Norwich victory over Aston Villa, who have now gone 18 league games without a win. Howson volleyed in the opener from Nathan Redmond's cross midway through the first half and that was how it stayed until three minutes from time when Mbokani headed home the second. It was a second win in three for Alex Neil's side to edge them away from the relegation zone, while Villa remain rooted to the foot of the table with their hopes of survival slimming by the week. Villa were certainly the better side in the opening stages with Scott Sinclair looking particularly bright down the right. He was involved in a move that eventually saw the ball come to Leandro Bacuna 25 yards out and he tested Declan Rudd with the first shot of the match. Norwich manager Alex Neil says their 2-0 win against Aston Villa was a crucial result Norwich manager Alex Neil says their 2-0 win against Aston Villa was a crucial result From the resulting corner, Micah Richards was inches away from giving Remi Garde's side the lead. The ball dropped on the six-yard line but under pressure from his marker, Richards was unable to stab the ball goalwards. The visitors continued to press and fashioned the best chance of the half, Ashley Westwood's free-kick finding Jordan Ayew whose header forced Rudd to parry the ball away, diving to his left. Villa were well on top but it counted for little as they fell behind soon after. Redmond played a neat one-two with Graham Dorrans to get into the Villa box and clipped in a cross that skimmed off a defender's head and into the path of Howson, the midfielder making no mistake with his volley from eight yards with 24 minutes on the clock. Jonny Howson celebrates after putting Norwich in front Despite a decent response from Villa, Norwich could have doubled their lead as a smart corner routine saw Dorrans fire just wide of the near post from a low delivery. It was a similar story in the second half as Villa again started on the front foot but were unable to create any real openings. Remi Garde says Norwich deserved their 2-0 win against Aston Villa Remi Garde says Norwich deserved their 2-0 win against Aston Villa Redmond tried his luck with a shot form 25 yards that bounced just in front of Guzan and when the 'keeper spilled it, the ball ran to Howson on the edge of the box, but the former Leeds midfielder was unable to find his mark and slid the ball narrowly wide. Ayew briefly caused panic in the Norwich defence with a powerful run through the middle before choosing to pass out wide having reached the edge of the area with just one defender ahead of him. Soon after, a Ciaran Clark slip nearly allowed Mbokani to run through on goal but the defender recovered to make a crucial slide tackle to deny the striker. Scott Sinclair (right) was a rare bright spark for Aston Villa At that point the game seemed destined to end 1-0 but another defensive lapse, this time from Alan Hutton, allowed Norwich the chance to clinch the win. Redmond found Hoolahan on the edge of the box and delivered a perfect cross to Mbokani, who had peeled away to the far post before planting a header past Guzan to wrap up all three points. There was still time for Ayew to draw a fantastic save out of Rudd with a curling free-kick in the final minute of stoppage time before the final whistle went and Norwich were able to celebrate a crucial win. Phil Thompson's Soccer Saturday verdict \"You've got to look at quality - and there's certainly none in this team. We know Norwich had a good result at Manchester United, but they're not a team to fear. \"Norwich, you always felt, had the cutting edge. Nathan Redmond was different class - he creates the opening goal. It was fine margins as it was fought out in the middle. \"It's not really good enough at this level. You look at Rudy Gestede - he's a trier and he might get you one or two goals. Jordan Ayew has come on leaps and bounds, and he's turned a corner for this side, but that's not going to be enough for them. \"I believe they've been let down by a lot of people, including the scouting network which has identified a lot of these players, who are not really of Premier League standard. This defeat today just resigns them to it, and I don't think they will splash out any sort of money in January.\" Player ratings Norwich: Rudd (7), Martin (6), Bennett (6), Bassong (6), Brady (7), Tettey (7), Howson (7), Dorrans (6), Redmond (7), Hoolahan (6), Mbokani (7).

The visitors set up to counter attack and it paid off in the 17th minute as Erik Lamela side-footed past Heurelho Gomes. Watford equalised just before the break when Odion Ighalo scrapped his way past Eric Dier and poked home his 30th goal of 2015 - more than any other player in England's top four divisions. But the Hornets went a man down on 63 minutes when Nathan Ake was shown a straight red card for a high tackle on Lamela, and Son flicked an audacious back-heel inside the near post on 89 minutes to secure a third straight win for Spurs. With Watford having won their last two home games, including a 3-0 defeat of Liverpool, Spurs head coach Pochettino set his side up to hit them on the break with a 3-4-3 formation. Heung-Min Son was the match winner for Spurs Kieran Trippier and Danny Rose started as wing-backs as two of three changes, with Tom Carroll coming into midfield and Eric Dier slotting in at centre-back, while Watford brought in Ake and Ikechi Anya.

Darlow was brought in as a late replacement for first-choice Rob Elliot, who was unwell in the warm-up, but he allowed a Darren Fletcher header to squirm past him with 12 minutes remaining. A high-intensity encounter saw woodwork hit three times - once by the Baggies and twice from Newcastle - while West Brom forced 17 corners and had 22 shots at the Newcastle goal - 12 of which were blocked by some magnificent last-ditch defending. Newcastle's Karl Darlow leaves the pitch after his team's 0-1 defeat The victory ends a run of five games without a win for Tony Pulis' men, who pull six points clear of relegation threatened Newcastle. But Steve McClaren's men, who had appeals for a penalty on Aleksandar Mitrovic turned down, remain in the bottom three. West Brom were keen to put pressure on Darlow, who has made just one appearance for Newcastle - in the Capital One Cup - since moving from Nottingham Forest in 2014. Victor Anichebe - starting ahead of the out-of-favour Saido Berahino, whom Tony Pulis said was \"lucky to even be on the bench\" - caused havoc in the penalty area but though the ball broke to James Morrison six yards out, his effort was blocked on the line by Fabricio Coloccini. Tony Pulis praised his entire team for their performance against Newcastle as they won 1-0 Tony Pulis praised his entire team for their performance against Newcastle as they won 1-0 Morrison fired another effort at goal six minutes later from 20 yards which was diverted away to safety by the alert Darlow. That should have settled his nerves, but he rarely looked comfortable when the pressure was turned up. Georginio Wijnaldum was a threat on the counter attack for the visitors and he stung the palms of Boaz Myhill on 13 minutes in a breathless first quarter of the game. The pace did ease but Coloccini's level of performance did not as he was perfectly positioned on 28 minutes to block a Fletcher attempt away from inside his own six yard box, before making another vital intervention from under his own crossbar following a looping Jonny Evans header. Steve McClaren reacts on the touchline Newcastle threatened themselves from set-pieces and somehow failed to take the lead on 55 minutes. Paul Dummett rose highest from a left-wing corner and his header looped towards goal but came back off the woodwork. The ball then dropped to Coloccini around six yards out but his back-heel clipped the post and went wide. The visitors continued to press and had claims for a penalty on 61 minutes. Steve McClaren admits stand-in goalkeeper Karl Darlow should have saved the goal that cost Newcastle against West Brom. Steve McClaren admits stand-in goalkeeper Karl Darlow should have saved the goal that cost Newcastle against West Brom. Mitrovic bundled his way past Evans inside the box, who had his arms all over the striker. The Newcastle man managed to get his shot away, which was cleared by Chris Brunt, but he felt he was impeded by the Baggies man. The referee was unmoved. Newcastle substitute Cheick Tiote, who replaced the hamstring-stricken Vurnon Anita, sold Darlow short with a back-pass on 71 minutes but Anichebe could not flick his effort into the unguarded net. The burly striker came even closer four minutes later, winning a header inside the six-yard box following a Brunt corner but the ball rebounded back off the crossbar. Fletcher (C) celebrates scoring his team's first goal against Newcastle United The pressure was growing on Darlow, who had looked nervous throughout - flapping and spilling crosses - and with 12 minutes to go, his mistake handed West Brom the three points. Fletcher burst into the box and met a Claudio Yacob cross with a firm header. The ball was straight at the goalkeeper but he failed to get any weight behind the effort and it squirmed agonisingly into the back of the net. Darlow did redeem himself slightly in the closing stages with two good stops from substitute Berahino and Anichebe, but the damage had already been done. Newcastle failed to muster a single chance in the closing 10 minutes. A turbulent 2016 may await the Toon. Charlie Nicholas's Soccer Saturday verdict \"(Newcastle) gave everything they had, and were pretty decent going forward at times. Defensively, they put their bodies on line. \"At one point in the second half they had a stonewall penalty (Evans on Mitrovic). It was like a challenge from 10 years ago - I don't know how he got away with it. \"Steve McClaren will be pleased with the effort, they gave everything. Paul Dummett was unlucky after hitting the bar - he had an excellent game - but there was justice in that West Brom won the match. \"Berahino came on, and looks as if he needs games. He might have to trim up a bit. I don't see him being there much longer - and by the time we do our next show, I'd be surprised if we're not talking about where he will be next.\" Player ratings West Brom: Myhill (7), Olsson (6), Yacob (7), Evans (6), Morrison (6), Anichebe (8), Brunt (6), McAuley (7), Fletcher (8), Dawson (7), Sessegnon (7).

moved to the top of the Premier League with a 2-0 win over Bournemouth at the Emirates. Arsene Wenger's side knew they could take top spot for 24 hours at least with a win as Leicester host Manchester City on Tuesday night. And they took full advantage by claiming all three points against the Cherries, with Ozil producing his 16th assist of the season when his corner was headed home by Gabriel in the first half. Gabriel celebrates after opening the scoring It was a terrific display by the German World Cup winner, who was a constant threat to the visitors, and he deservedly got on the scoresheet himself after the break following an impressive team move. Overall, it was a fine evening's work for Arsenal, with Petr Cech also setting a new record for clean sheets in the Premier League with his 170th shut-out. However, the home side actually started very slowly as Bournemouth enjoyed some early possession, with Charlie Daniels and Marc Pugh especially having some joy down the left-hand side. Calum Chambers and Harry Arter of Bournemouth compete for the ball Arsenal began to dominate as the half wore on, however, with Ozil causing the away defence all sorts of problems. It was his delivery which was met by Gabriel in the 27th minute, with Bournemouth failing to check the Brazilian's run as he headed into the top corner. It could have been 2-0 shortly afterwards when Ozil's delightful ball on the right-hand side completely wiped out the Bournemouth backline and picked out Theo Walcott but he was edged out wide and his effort was cleared. Ozil slots past Artur Boruc to put Arsenal 2-0 up From the resulting corner Ozil's delivery was met again by Gabriel whose header was touched on to the post and rebounded off the head of Per Mertesacker from close range before dropping wide. A minute later Ozil again brilliantly picked out Walcott but he blasted his shot off of Artur Boruc before Olivier Giroud headed high over the bar from the resulting corner. Calum Chambers says Arsenal gave a great team performance and hailed the quality of Mesut Ozil Calum Chambers says Arsenal gave a great team performance and hailed the quality of Mesut Ozil The visitors were struggling to deal with Ozil and his deliveries into the box and looked unsettled again as the midfielder whipped in another Arsenal corner which was flicked on by Gabriel but Aaron Ramsey was unable to head in at the back post. Petr Cech of Arsenal applauds the fans after his team's 2-0 win over Bournemouth After the break Bournemouth had a half-chance to restore parity when Josh King sped clear of the Arsenal defence but was dragged out wide and his low cross was cleared. Dan Gosling then appealed for a penalty as he went down after getting a touch of the ball ahead of Gabriel. He felt there was contact from the defender but referee Roger East waved away the claims. Arsene Wenger says Arsenal’s 2-0 win against Bournemouth was the perfect response to their heavy Boxing Day defeat at Southampton Arsene Wenger says Arsenal’s 2-0 win against Bournemouth was the perfect response to their heavy Boxing Day defeat at Southampton The hosts then doubled their lead shortly after the hour mark with a typical free-flowing Arsenal move. Ozil started it off by sending the ball out wide before picking up the return and finding Giroud, whose neat flick through the Bournemouth defence found Ozil still on the move and he coolly slotted the ball under Boruc. Olivier Giroud of Arsenal and Adam Smith of Bournemouth compete for the ball It was nearly three just a few minutes later as Hector Bellerin picked out the run of Walcott on the right but he fired his low shot just wide of Boruc's far post as Ramsey looked for the cut-back. Walcott's blushes were then spared slightly when Boruc spilled Giroud's effort from the edge of the box but the flag went up as the England forward failed to find the target from close range. Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe praised Arsenal for their quality and said that corners seemed to wobble his side Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe praised Arsenal for their quality and said that corners seemed to wobble his side The Frenchman then had the chance to get on the scoresheet when Ozil picked him out 12 yards from goal but he scuffed his effort wide. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain then went close for the hosts following a quick Arsenal break but his shot was deflected and then pushed on to the post by Boruc. There was time for a chance at either end as the clock ticked down, with Cech denying Glenn Murray before Boruc was on hand to save from Walcott again.

"report": "Manchester United's Ander Herrera (left) rues a missed chance Manchester United put on an improved display for beleaguered boss Louis van Gaal, but failed to find a way past Chelsea at Old Trafford. Both teams spurned a number of presentable chances, with the hosts striking the woodwork on two occasions in the first period and United goalkeeper David de Gea made several impressive stops at the other end. However, a goalless draw left United in sixth place - five points behind Manchester City in the fourth and final Champions League spot, albeit having played a game more than their rivals - while Chelsea move up to 14th in the table. Van Gaal had hinted at quitting after a wretched slump in form, but although his side have now gone eight games without victory in all competitions, they at least avoided sinking to five straight defeats for the first time since December 1936. Manchester United scarves displaying the image of former Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho were on sale outside Old Trafford The merchandise sellers outside Old Trafford hawked scarves bearing Jose Mourinho's face but Van Gaal was able to acknowledge applause from large sections inside the stadium as he stepped out of the tunnel. The Dutchman recalled captain Wayne Rooney in place of Memphis Depay after the striker had been dropped to the bench for Saturday's 2-0 loss at Stoke City, while experienced German midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger was back from suspension and full-back Matteo Darmian also returned after a recent hamstring injury. As for the visitors, interim coach Guus Hiddink was able to call upon playmaker Eden Hazard after a hip problem, with the Belgium international playing as a 'false' No 9 in the absence of suspended striker Diego Costa. After the match, Louis van Gaal insisted he will not resign It was United, though, who made a lightning start to the contest, with Juan Mata inches away from opening the scoring against his former club after just three minutes. However, the Spaniard's well-struck left-footed shot from just inside the area may have beaten Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois, but not the crossbar. Chelsea responded to that close call by immediately going up the other end of the pitch and after Hazard had failed to pick out the unmarked Willian in the six-yard box folloowing Daley Blind's untimely slip, it was John Terry's turn to almost break the deadlock. The Chelsea skipper rose well at the near post to direct a powerful header goalwards from Willian's curling right-wing corner, only for De Gea to make a sensational fingertip save to keep the scoreline goalless. That was all the champions offered in the opening 45 minutes though as they struggled to pose many questions to United's back four. The home side, on the other hand, were far more threatening, with all the danger coming down their left flank through the lively Anthony Martial, who was desperately unlucky not to score just past the quarter-hour mark. Louis van Gaal walked out on his press conference just days before Christmas... and on Monday night, the United manager explained why he did it Louis van Gaal walked out on his press conference just days before Christmas... and on Monday night, the United manager explained why he did it Collecting the ball near the left-hand touchline, the powerful Frenchman drove at the retreating Chelsea defence, before cutting in and striking the base of Courtois' near post with a well-struck shot, before the 'keeper then thwarted Rooney with an impressive save just before the half-hour mark. The visitors were more purposeful after the break, however, and could have gone in front just three minutes into the second period, but for a brilliant double save from De Gea. The Spaniard first denied Pedro and then on the follow-up Cesar Azpilicueta after an excellent driving run by Hazard had created the openings. Herrera was brilliantly denied by Thibaut Courtois But those near misses appeared to galvanise United, who themselves were left to rue the brilliance of the opposition goalkeeper just before the hour-mark. Martial, who caused opposite number Branislav Ivanovic problems all game long, drove at the visitors' back line before pulling the ball back for the waiting Ander Herrera just six yards out, only for Courtois to deny him with a sensational point-blank stop. If United were left cursing the brilliance of the giant Belgian, they were also grateful that Nemanja Matic failed to punish them minutes later after the defensive midfielder found himself racing clean through on goal. Wayne Rooney could not break the deadlock in the game's dying moments However, with just De Gea to beat, the Serbia international blazed high over the bar and Chelsea's best chance to claim an all-too-rare away win in the Premier League this season had gone. United had one last great opening to claim all three points right at the death after substitute Cameron Borthwick-Jackson set up Rooney at the far post, only for the striker to miss the target and the chance to relieve the pressure on his under-fire boss, who insisted after that whistle that he would not resign.

West Ham pair Andy Carroll and Michail Antonio helped West Ham secure the club's first win since October West Ham pair Andy Carroll and Michail Antonio helped West Ham secure the club's first win since October West Ham had gone into the match unbeaten in their last six Premier League home games and made a positive start, with Mauro Zarate clipping a shot wide before Enner Valencia saw a long-range drive blocked. However, on 13 minutes Southampton took the lead through the first real chance of the match. Shane Long surged into the area after good play from the visitors and squared across the six-yard box, where Dusan Tadic deflected the ball onto Jenkinson, who sent the ball into his own net. Carl Jenkinson turns the ball into his own net The visitors seized the initiative from there on, dominating possession and going close through Long before failing to convert a flurry of chances before the interval. Jose Fonte drew a dramatic save from Adrian, Sadio Mane shot wide and Tadic - after some neat footwork - fired at the 'keeper as Southampton pushed for a second. After seeing his side outplayed for much of the first period, Bilic rang the changes at the break, throwing on Carroll and Manuel Lanzini for Zarate and Alex Song - and almost immediately got the response he was after. Just two minutes after the re-start, James Collins' header was cleared off the line from an early corner before Carroll blew a golden opportunity, blasting over off the bar from five yards out with the goal at his mercy. Southampton celebrate after taking a 13th minute lead Carroll and Oriol Romeu then sent tame efforts goalwards at either end before West Ham pulled level in bizarre circumstances. Antonio burst into the Southampton box but lost his footing and fell to the ground. However, Victor Wanyama, trying to clear, fired the ball into the West Ham man and the ball looped up and over Maarten Stekelenburg and into the net. Jenkinson tussles with Dusan Tadic With the momentum on their side, West Ham surged forward looking for a winner, with Antonio teeing up Lanzini to shoot wide before Carroll seemed unfortunate to see a free-kick awarded against him rather than a penalty given in his favour when he collided with Ryan Bertrand in the box. Southampton were far from pinned in their own half, but the visitors were stung on 79 minutes when Carroll put West Ham ahead. Southampton manager Ronald Koeman says his side lost control in the first 25 minutes of the second half Southampton manager Ronald Koeman says his side lost control in the first 25 minutes of the second half Antonio - involved in all of West Ham's best moves - headed Valencia's cross against the underside of the bar and Carroll was quickest to react, pouncing on the loose ball to score his second of the season. West Ham had to hold off a determined onslaught from Southampton in the closing stages but, aside from Virgil van Dijk's off-target shot, the hosts were largely untroubled and saw out the final minutes to sign off 2015 with a victory.

the goals from Stoke's 2-0 win over Man Utd, with analysis from Dwight Yorke Stoke increased the pressure on Louis van Gaal as Manchester United suffered a fourth straight defeat in all competitions thanks to a 2-0 loss at the Britannia Stadium.

Defeat means United, who face Chelsea on Monday, have lost four straight games in all competitions in a single season for the first time in 54 years and drop down to sixth on goal difference, while Stoke sit comfortably in 10th. Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal holds his hand up as he leaves the pitch at the Britannia Stadium Rooney had issued a rallying cry before his side's trip to the Britannia, asking his team-mates to save the club's season, but he was only handed a watching brief from the bench. Stoke instead started brightly with Xherdan Shaqiri flashing a dangerous cross right across United's six-yard box in the third minute. Mark Hughes praised his Stoke's dominant performance in their Premier League win over Man Utd Mark Hughes praised his Stoke's dominant performance in their Premier League win over Man Utd The hosts needed Jack Butland to keep out Ander Herrera's low shot from the edge of the box, but they continued to put United under pressure as Arnautovic curled a free-kick wide of the upright. But they were soon ahead in the 17th minute courtesy of an error from Depay, who headed the ball straight into the path of Glen Johnson, the defender squaring the ball for Bojan to fire home. Memphis Depay heads the ball under pressure from Glen Johnson Their lead was doubled seven minutes later when Bojan's free-kick rebounded to Arnautovic, who unleashed a thunderous drive past David De Gea and into the top corner from 25 yards.

The introduction of Rooney after the break seemed to give United a new lease of life as Marouane Fellaini forced Butland into a spectacular save from close range after good approach play by the United captain in the box. Stoke's Marko Arnautovic celebrates after scoring his team's second goal against Manchester United In the 72nd minute, United needed a vital touch from Ashley Young to prevent Arnautovic from latching on to a curled cross from the right and having a clear sight of De Gea's goal. However, De Gea was called into action again in the 80th minute as he beat clear Bojan's stinging cross at his near post before Charlie Adam sent a free-kick over the bar from 30 yards. Arnautovic smashes Stoke 2-0 up Van Gaal's last throw of the dice was to send on 19-year-old Andreas Pereira for the final seven minutes as Anthony Martial and Juan Mata forced Butland into yet more superb stops.

Despite being in the ascendancy for large periods of the first half, Villa were behind at the break as Aaron Cresswell's sumptuous low drive put the Hammers in front in first-half stoppage-time. But Remi Garde's side drew level on 62 minutes as Jordan Ayew converted a penalty after Angelo Ogbonna was adjudged to have clipped striker Rudy Gestede in the area. West Ham Boss Slaven Bilic said a draw was a fair result in his sides 1-1 with Aston Villa West Ham Boss Slaven Bilic said a draw was a fair result in his sides 1-1 with Aston Villa Villa pushed for a winner late on but failed to find a breakthrough, leaving them rooted to the bottom of the Premier League and without a victory since the first day of the season. West Ham, meanwhile, earned a draw for the fourth game in a row, although Cresswell's strike ended a run of three consecutive goalless draws. Villa fans got behind their relegation-threatened side from the off, cheering raucously in a promising opening spell for the hosts. Michail Antonio battles for the ball with Carlos Sanchez Villa responded to the support, with Gestede having the game's first chance on 18 minutes but his header missed the target. That chance sparked a spell of Villa dominance, but a smart double save from Adrian on 28 minutes - to deny Leandro Bacuna and then Gestede - ensured the spell would not yield a goal. Villa lost Carlos Sanchez to injury seven minutes before half-time and, as his replacement Carles Gil adjusted to the game, West Ham took the chance to open to scoring. Aaron Cresswell rifled home West Ham's opener at Villa Park. Shortly after Cheikhou Kouyate had headed Enner Valencia's deflected shot on the bar, Cresswell punished a defensive lapse from Villa, utilising the space afforded to him before using Alan Hutton as a shield to drill a swerving shot beyond the reach of Brad Guzan. It was a cruel blow for Villa given their promising play in the opening 45 minutes, but they returned after the interval undeterred and could have been level within five minutes of the restart, but Gestede failed to head Hutton's cross home. Jordan Veretout ensured Adrian was called into action to keep out his low drive on 53 minutes, and the Spaniard was on hand again to keep Gestede's effort out six minutes later as Villa pushed for an equaliser. Jordan Ayew converts the penalty to equalise The breakthrough finally came shortly after the hour-mark when Ogbonna - much to the annoyance of West Ham players and staff, who felt he was fouled in the build-up - was penalised for clipping Gestede, allowing Ayew to equalise with a fine penalty. Villa went from winning and scoring a penalty to almost conceding two of their own, as Bacuna appeared to block Mark Noble's goal-bound effort with his hands on 70 minutes, before Westwood did the same to a chipped pass from substitute Alex Song. Aston Villa boss Remi Garde felt his side deserved more than just a draw against West Ham Aston Villa boss Remi Garde felt his side deserved more than just a draw against West Ham Referee Mike Dean was unmoved on both occasions as the spoils were shared, a result which does little to help Villa's plight at the bottom of the table.

Palace move up to fifth following Manchester United's defeat by Stoke earlier on Saturday afternoon, while Bournemouth stay 14th with 20 points from 18 games. Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew arrives at Dean Court for the match against Bournemouth Alan Pardew made two enforced changes from their 2-1 win over Stoke last weekend, bringing in Jordon Mutch and Fraizer Campbell for injured pair Connor Wickham and Yannick Bolasie, and it was Campbell who created Palace's first opening. The striker's deflected cross from the left on nine minutes had Artur Boruc back-pedalling, but in windy conditions the ball landed on the roof of the net. From the resulting corner - Palace's third inside the first 10 minutes - Jason Puncheon's delivery was met well by Delaney, but Francis reacted superbly to flick clear. More good work from Delaney presented Campbell with another chance after 15 minutes, as the defender dispossessed Murray and delivered for the striker, but Campbell curled his effort over from 18 yards. Alan Pardew praised the work rate and effort from Bournemouth as well as his own side Alan Pardew praised the work rate and effort from Bournemouth as well as his own side The Cherries grew into the game after Palace's bright start, and had two chances in as many minutes midway through the first half. Matt Ritchie and Murray went for the same ball after a brilliant run and cross from Junior Stanislas, with Murray heading inches wide against his former club. Adam Smith turned provider next for the home side, but his low centre was a yard ahead of the onrushing Murray as Palace survived. Harry Arter was warned for a late tackle on Wilfried Zaha shortly after, and the Bournemouth midfielder went into the book 10 minutes before half-time for another mistimed tackle on the Palace winger. Eddie Howe was pleased with how his side performed against Crystal Palace Eddie Howe was pleased with how his side performed against Crystal Palace Just prior, the home side had two quick-fire opportunities to break the deadlock. Dann almost turned Smith's cross into his own net first, before Gosling's deflected strike from the edge of the box had Hennessey scrambling. The final opening of the first 45 minutes fell to Stanislas, but the winger failed to keep his shot down, and despite an entertaining first half, it ended goalless with just one shot on target from either side. Both teams made changes at half-time as Arter was withdraw for Eunan O'Kane, while Mutch, making his first league start since the opening day, was replaced by the returning Cabaye. Pape Souare takes on Matt Ritchie O'Kane made a quick impact, finding a pocket of space on the edge of the Palace penalty area before forcing a smart save from Hennessey in the 51st minute. Four minutes later, Murray miscued for the second time when well-placed. The striker scored 44 goals in 113 league games for Palace during a three-year spell at Selhurst Park, but failed to properly test the Palace 'keeper after excellent running from Gosling. The Bournemouth midfielder passed up the opportunity to shoot himself, setting up his team-mate 12 yards out, but Murray's first-time effort was scuffed into the arms of a grateful Hennessey. Gosling's half-hearted penalty appeal on the hour mark was waved away by referee Michael Oliver, before Murray was replaced by Rantie for the final 20 minutes. The South Africa international made an immediate impression, offering a threat in behind that Bournemouth had lacked with Murray as the lone striker. He had one clear sight of goal in his brief cameo, but delayed his shot in the Palace box after an O'Kane cut-back, giving Dann enough time to superbly block his toe-poked effort. Dann and Delaney both suffered injuries as the game moved into the final 10 minutes, but Palace had already made their three changes. The duo continued, with Delaney visibly hobbling, but both sides seemed happy to earn a point in scrappy final exchanges. Bournemouth's Charlie Daniels thought that Boxing Day's 0-0 result against Crystal Palace was probably a fair result. Bournemouth's Charlie Daniels thought that Boxing Day's 0-0 result against Crystal Palace was probably a fair result. Palace, unbeaten in the league since their Monday Night Football defeat by Sunderland in late November, face Swansea City on Monday, while Eddie Howe's side travel to Arsenal on the same day.

Chelsea's goals at Stamford Bridge A revitalised Diego Costa struck twice as Chelsea began their second spell under Guus Hiddink with a thrilling 2-2 draw at home to in-form Watford. The Blues had to come from behind but will feel they should have claimed all three points as Oscar slipped and sent a potentially match-winning penalty ballooning into the stands with 10 minutes left. Costa had given Chelsea a 32nd-minute lead, but Watford hit back as Troy Deeney tucked away a penalty and his ever-dangerous strike partner Odion Ighalo scored yet again after the break. Another classy Costa finish levelled things up, but Oscar's blooper meant a pulsating Boxing Day encounter ended with the sides sharing the spoils. Watford's Troy Deeney makes it 1-1 from the penalty spot against Chelsea The Blues looked eager to impress early on and Costa headed Pedro's cross just over as they monopolised possession in the first 15 minutes. But Watford quickly found their feet and Ighalo squandered a great chance to give them the advantage, pulling his shot well wide after Jurado's effort had fallen perfectly for him. However, Willian's corners were a regular source of problems for the Watford defence and Chelsea took the lead when the Brazilian's cross bounced into the six-yard box off the heads of Gary Cahill and John Terry, and Costa swivelled expertly before volleying the ball into the back of the net. Costa guides his shot past Gomes to make it 2-2 at Stamford Bridge Suitably encouraged, Chelsea began to attack with gusto but Oscar shot over the bar after good work from Branislav Ivanovic and they then conceded an equaliser in bizarre fashion. Ben Watson's right-wing corner appeared to pose little threat but Nemanja Matic completely misjudged its flight and ended up handling the ball right in front of the ref, giving Deeney (42) the chance to coolly roll his spot-kick into the net as Courtois dived off to his right. Chelsea interim boss Guus Hiddink was happy with his players' performance despite the 2-2 draw with Watford Chelsea interim boss Guus Hiddink was happy with his players' performance despite the 2-2 draw with Watford And things got even better for Watford 11 minutes after the break when Ighalo (56) scored for a club-record fifth consecutive top-flight match in a row, albeit in fortuitous fashion. Having been found by Jurado, the forward took his time before unleashing a low shot which hit Cahill's foot and flew into the net, with Courtois totally wrong-footed by the deflection. Chelsea were undaunted and levelled the match when Willian, out on the right, found Costa (65) with an inch-perfect low pass and the forward finished adroitly once again, taking one touch to set himself up and then guiding the ball past Heurelho Gomes with his second. Watford boss Quique Sanchez Flores said that his side's 2-2 draw with Chelsea was a game for the fans Watford boss Quique Sanchez Flores said that his side's 2-2 draw with Chelsea was a game for the fans Eden Hazard was fit enough for the Chelsea bench and, given 15 minutes to conjure up a winner for the hosts, it appeared to be mission accomplished when he was scythed down in the box by fellow substitute Valon Behrami. However, Oscar failed to deliver from the spot in spectacular style, pausing as he began his run-up and then tripping over as he sent the ball high into the stands behind the goal. Oscar watches the ball fly over the bar as he slips taking a penalty The Blues continued to press forward nonetheless but Costa marred a good afternoon's work with a booking, which means he will be banned for Monday's big game against Manchester United. The unlikely figure of John Obi Mikel almost sent Chelsea into that match on a high but his late shot was just wide of the target and Chelsea will go into the Old Trafford blockbuster just a couple of points clear of the drop zone. Watford, meanwhile, emerged from another tough match with their reputation further enhanced and they sit seventh ahead of Tottenham's visit to Vicarage Road on Monday. Alan McInally discusses Guus Hiddink's first game in charge of Chelsea Alan McInally discusses Guus Hiddink's first game in charge of Chelsea Alan McInally's Soccer Saturday verdict: \"Willian is far and away the best in Blue at the moment, he was fantastic. Every corner caused plenty of problems for Chelsea, the delivery was fantastic \"I have to take my hat off to Watford. They were never genuinely out of the game, even though they conceded first. The two boys up front were fantastic. \"Costa took a couple of bangs today, and actually half behaved himself this afternoon. He was better, his movement was okay, and the finishing was excellent.

beat leaders Leicester 1-0 at Anfield. The big striker converted Roberto Firmino's low cross just past the hour mark and despite some anxious moments late on, Liverpool held on for a first win in four, condemning Leicester to just a second league defeat of the season. Having opted for Divock Origi over Benteke in attack, Jurgen Klopp will have been pleased by the way his side started the game, Philippe Coutinho curling a shot just wide of the far post in the third minute. Liverpool appeared to be trying to match up with Firmino often playing right up alongside Origi in a 4-4-2. Leicester soon showed their teeth though as Riyad Mahrez skipped past Alberto Moreno and got to the byline, only to see his cross cut out by Mamadou Sakho at the near post. The Reds gradually assumed control and Firmino threaded a pass through to Origi, whose shot was well blocked by Wes Morgan. Jurgen Klopp celebrates Liverpool's victory Origi got in again down the right soon after and his cut back was curled just over by Coutinho as Liverpool pressed for an opening goal. The Foxes' threat on the break was evident, and despite Liverpool often doing well to contain it, there were still glimpses of the quality Leicester have shown in recent weeks. Liverpool kept pushing forward and Kasper Schmeichel was forced into action twice in as many minutes at the midpoint of the half, first to push away Emre Can's low effort from the edge of the box and then to get down smother Origi's effort after the striker had outmuscled Morgan to get into the box. Jurgen Klopp praised his side's performance to beat league leaders Leicester Jurgen Klopp praised his side's performance to beat league leaders Leicester Leicester then created a half-chance out of nothing as Mark Albrighton looped a cross into the box but the back-pedalling Jamie Vardy was unable to control the header and it floated over. Klopp was then forced into a change as the impressive Origi went down with what seemed to be a hamstring problem and was replaced by Benteke. That change - coincidentally, perhaps - was followed by Leicester's best period of the first half and Mahrez went close to breaking the deadlock in the final minute of the half. Claudio Ranieri congratulated Liverpool on their victory Claudio Ranieri congratulated Liverpool on their victory After Kante had driven to the edge of the box, the ball was worked to Mahrez and after working half a yard of space, he hit a fierce shot that Simon Mignolet did well to push over the bar. Leicester began the second half far brighter with Liverpool appearing to have lost the composure they showed before the break. A scuffed pass from Sakho caused panic but with Dejan Lovren seeming to have resolved the situation, Mignolet played the ball back to Sakho, who have two men within two yards of him and he was forced to make another hurried clearance. Benteke celebrates his vital goal Liverpool eventually settled down again though and Benteke headed just over from Henderson's right-wing cross. Five minutes later though and he was celebrating, Firmino cutting the ball back for the Belgian to score his first goal since the end of October. Claudio Ranieri wasted little time in trying to alter the course of the game, taking off Shinji Okazki and top scorer Vardy, with Nathan Dyer and Leonardo Ulloa thrown on. It seemed to work as Leicester started to push forward and Dyer almost got the equaliser, diverting a Christian Fuchs cross goalwards, only for Mignolet to make a smart save at his near post. Fuchs caused more nervousness in the Liverpool defence with 10 minutes to go. His long throw was eventually gathered by Mignolet having come loose in the six yard box. Matt Le Tissier gives his thoughts on Liverpool's 1-0 win over Leicester City on Boxing Day Matt Le Tissier gives his thoughts on Liverpool's 1-0 win over Leicester City on Boxing Day Coutinho almost doubled Liverpool's lead a minute later with a ferocious dipping shot that brushed the roof of the net before Firmino shot wide after a collision between Danny Simpson and Morgan. Leicester continued to press and Andy King's goal-bound volley needed a deflection to send it wide. Liverpool should twice have sealed the win in the closing stages, first as Henderson ran through with two men for support before playing the ball to no one having reached the penalty area. That was nothing compared to Benteke's miss in the final minute, though, as Firmino played him in for an open goal with Schmeichel stranded up field having gone up for a long throw. The Belgian contrived to shoot straight at the only defender back - Morgan - with the goal gaping before Lucas headed the rebound wide. But it mattered not in the end as Liverpool held on for the three points.

Manuel Pellegrini's men suffered a 2-1 defeat at Arsenal on Monday Night Football but bounced back to form in style, racing into a 3-0 lead inside 22 minutes with goals from Raheem Sterling, Yaya Toure and Wilfried Bony. Kevin De Bruyne added a fourth and they could even afford a missed second-half penalty by Bony, but City's victory was soured by substitute Vincent Kompany limping off just nine minutes into his first appearance since November 8, suffering a recurrence of his calf injury. Manchester City skipper Vincent Kompany looks dejected as he leaves the pitch against Sunderland Sunderland, who netted a consolation through Fabio Borini, remain in a relegation fight, five points from safety, and they have now lost four games in a row for the first time since April 2014, while City are now just three points off league leaders Leicester with the two teams set to face each other on Tuesday. City have kept seven clean sheets in eight games with Kompany in the team this season and only one in the 10 games without him so the sight of the skipper on the City bench- alongside rested Sergio Aguero - gave everyone associated with the club a pre-match boost. Sterling celebrates with Kevin De Bruyne That feel-good factor transmitted itself onto the pitch as City were quicker to every second ball and they took the lead on 13 minutes. De Bruyne was given far too much room to cross from the right and Sterling pounced from close range with a firm header. Sunderland continued to give City far too much space and Toure doubled the lead four minutes later with a wonderful shimmy and shot from 25 yards that nestled in the bottom corner. That same part of the net was rippling on 22 minutes as Bony got above John O'Shea to head home De Bruyne free-kick. De Bruyne has now been directly involved in 17 goals in 13 appearances in all competitions for the Citizens on home soil (eight goals, nine assists). Sterling puts Manchester City 1-0 up Sterling had a potential fourth goal ruled out for offside just before half-time and David Silva really should have done better from the edge of the box when dragging a shot wide of the far post. City maintained their forward momentum after the break and Silva was denied by a wonderful fingertip save by Vito Mannone on 47 minutes. Phil Thompson talks about Manchester City's emphatic 4-1 victory over Sunderland as they close the gap at the top of the table Phil Thompson talks about Manchester City's emphatic 4-1 victory over Sunderland as they close the gap at the top of the table The Spaniard and De Bruyne were enjoying themselves in the space afforded to them by the Sunderland midfield, showcasing some neat interplay as City hunted a fourth goal and it came on 54 minutes. Silva poked a ball towards De Bruyne around 30 yards from goal and he tried to find Bony with a ball in behind. O'Shea got to the ball but it broke back to De Bruyne, who rolled the ball home from eight yards out. Kompany leaves the pitch injured shortly after coming on as a second half substitute City were rarely tested in defence but did wilt when Sunderland turned the pressure up on 59 minutes as Borini stole in at the back post to prod home from close range. Silva won his team a penalty on 66 minutes when Sebastian Coates fouled him just on the edge of the area but Bony ballooned the attempt over the crossbar.

Kompany went straight down the tunnel after being replaced by Martin Demichelis, shaking his head as fans looked on anxiously.

The only goal of the game came in the ninth minute when Angel Rangel's shot hit the post and Boaz Myhill failed to hold the rebound, allowing Ki Sung-Yueng to finish from close range. Neither side created many clear chances in a scrappy contest and Swansea, whose last victory was on October 24, held on for a much-needed victory under caretaker manager Alan Curtis. Swansea caretaker manager Alan Curtis is proud to have moved out of the Premier League relegation zone after holding on to beat West Brom 1-0 Swansea caretaker manager Alan Curtis is proud to have moved out of the Premier League relegation zone after holding on to beat West Brom 1-0 It is Curtis' first win since taking charge after the sacking of Garry Monk a fortnight ago and sees the Swans move just two points behind West Brom in the table. The defeat means the Baggies, who were on the front foot for much of the second half, have not won in five matches - their worst run under manager Tony Pulis. Craig Gardner (right) and Ashley Williams tussle for possession Both sides made two changes from their last outings, with Rickie Lambert starting ahead of Saido Berahino for the visitors and Bafetimbi Gomis on the bench for Swansea. With confidence low at the Liberty, an early goal was just what was required and it arrived thanks to a mistake from Myhill. It looked as though the Wales international would gather Rangel's shot after it hit the post and rebounded into his body, but he was unable to hold on and Ki followed up quickly to finish. Tony Pulis felt decisions went against West Brom and that cost them the game Tony Pulis felt decisions went against West Brom and that cost them the game It was just the start that Swansea wanted and they continued to apply pressure as Gylfi Sigurdsson shot at Myhill after good work from Wayne Routledge. But the out-of-form hosts were unable to build on the goal and West Brom grew into the match, even if they failed to fashion many clear opportunities. Their best moments came from set pieces as Chris Brunt's free-kick deflected just over and an enticing corner was flicked across the face of goal by Gareth McAuley. There was little in the way of goalmouth action at either end even after West Brom's introduction of Berahino and Stephane Sessegnon in the second half. Alan Curtis claimed his first win as interim manager Most of the chances were created by the visitors as Lukasz Fabianski saved quite comfortably from James Morrison and Lambert while Craig Dawson headed into the ground from a corner.

bagged his first ever Premier League goal to give Tottenham a 3-0 Boxing Day victory over Norwich at White Hart Lane. England international Kane struck the opener from the penalty spot on 26 minutes after he was brought down by Canaries 'keeper Declan Rudd. Kane then fired home his 11th league goal of the season four minutes before half-time from an acute angle, before substitute Carroll smashed in Tottenham's third with 10 minutes remaining. Harry Kane was feeling happy after his brace helped Tottenham to a 3-0 win over Norwich on Boxing Day Harry Kane was feeling happy after his brace helped Tottenham to a 3-0 win over Norwich on Boxing Day Norwich had several good chances but Spurs' second successive league victory keeps them in the top four and prevented Norwich building on their impressive away win at Manchester United last weekend. The visitors worried the hosts early on when Vadis Odjidja, making just his second start as one of two Norwich changes, forced birthday-boy Hugo Lloris into a full-stretched save to his right. Kyle Walker clears under pressure from Robbie Brady Cameron Jerome should have found the net with an unchallenged header from a corner on 17 minutes, with Lloris stricken from the well-taken corner. Kane missed with his first effort on goal, firing wide of the far post after Rudd had denied Kyle Walker, but the 22-year-old coolly sent Rudd the wrong way with his penalty after the Norwich 'keeper had rushed out to his feet and sent him tumbling. Spurs should have quickly doubled their lead from one of a number of good chances, with Toby Alderweireld sending one header wide and another straight at Rudd that Dele Alli followed up, but could not direct past the 'keeper. Tom Carroll scored his first ever Premier League goal in the win over Norwich But Kane, who scored twice in Tottenham's away win at Southampton before Christmas, made sure his side took a 2-0 lead into the break when he broke into the box and fired low, hard into the far corner from a tight angle on 42 minutes. With the 2-1 defeat to Newcastle - in which the away side struck twice late on at White Hart Lane - in mind, Spurs made it hard for Norwich to recover with Jerome only managing a tame header at goal before Carroll struck with the home side's third.

The game had looked to be heading for stalemate after stellar performances from Rob Elliot and his opposite number Tim Howard in the Everton goal. But Elliot could only punch a last-gasp Leighton Baines corner into the path of Cleverley, who sent a looping header over the home defence and into the net with 93 minutes on the clock to spark wild celebrations on the Everton bench. The Toffees, who dominated the first half, move into ninth place, one point behind city rivals Liverpool, while Newcastle remain in the relegation zone in 18th. Aleksandar Mitrovic reacts after a missed chance Elliot was making his ninth straight start after Tim Krul was ruled out for the season and the Newcastle 'keeper was called into action when Kevin Mirallas brought down a Seamus Coleman cross and hit a fierce drive that was kept out by the keeper's left foot. Daryl Janmaat then swept in a beautiful cross onto the six-yard line but Aleksandar Mitrovic failed to get a full head on the ball. Everton felt they should have had a penalty when Romelu Lukaku was seemingly pulled back by Fabricio Coloccini. Coleman had bent a pass into the path of the Belgian, who appeared to be wrestled to the ground by the Newcastle captain before Elliot calmly collected the forward pass. Elliot was then brought into action when Lukaku shot straight at him after Lennon split the Newcastle defence. Janmaat could have been giving his marching orders after upending Ross Barkley as the England midfielder burst towards the Toon goal but a free-kick was deemed enough by referee Lee Mason when a second yellow seemed inevitable. Newcastle were much improved after the break after should have broken the deadlock through Mitrovic. The Serbian flew into the penalty area to meet Moussa Sissoko's hanging cross but his thunderous header went wide and with it the Magpies' best chance of the game. Elliot was again brought into action by Lukaku when the Belgian - who was looking to become the first Everton player since Dixie Dean in 1924 to score in nine consecutive matches - turned Chancel Mbemba all too easily only to fire his low left-footed shot at the sprawling feet of Elliot. Aaron Lennon then stung the 'keeper's palms with a powerful shot that skimmed the soggy Tyneside surface. Roberto Martinez threw on Muhamed Besic and Gerard Deulofeu in place of Barkley and Lennon for the final 20 minutes but it was Newcastle who almost made a breakthrough. Gini Wijnaldum was found at the back post by Jack Colback but Newcastle's top scorer could not manage to direct his header past Howard. Elliot then emulated Howard with a save from Ramiro Funes Mori after the defender got on the end of a Baines corner but the 'keeper's performance counted for nothing after he failed to deal with a Baines corner, Cleverley striking a cruel late blow.

Saints took the lead through the unlikely source of Cuco Martina, who was starting his first Premier League game for the hosts, after the defender found the corner of the goal with a superb long-range half-volley. Shane Long added a second from close range in controversial fashion after Arsenal claimed he had fouled Laurent Koscielny in the build-up, before Jose Fonte headed home Southampton's third from a corner. Martina scores Southampton's opener with a superb right-footed effort Long got the better of the Arsenal defence again in stoppage time, driving the ball under Petr Cech's legs for 4-0. The result leaves Arsenal two points off leaders Leicester, while Saints stay 12th after their first win since November 7. The Gunners were unchanged from their vital 2-1 win over Manchester City five days earlier, and would have leapfrogged Leicester at the summit of the Premier League with a win. Arsenal players look dejected as Southampton took the lead at St Mary's Arsenal had the first half-chance of the game as Nacho Monreal forced Maarten Stekelenburg into a low save after the ball fell to his weaker right foot 12 yards out, but Saints were ahead moments later. Catching the ball with the outside of his right-foot 30 yards from goal, defender Martina found the bottom left-hand corner with a superb, swerving half-volley, a strike that could be a contender for goal of the season. And Saints had a fine chance to go 2-0 up going into half-time, but Long lifted the ball over the bar after getting on the end of Sadio Mane's lofted ball having beaten Per Mertesacker for pace. The hosts did double their lead 10 minutes after the break, however, after Long controversially converted from close range following Mane's square ball, despite Arsenal players' protesting that the Irishman had deliberately clipped Koscielny's heels moments earlier in the build-up. It was 3-0 with just over 20 minutes remaining as the unmarked Fonte headed home from point-blank range as Koscielny failed to deal with his opposite number's aerial presence.

Long hit the post while one-on-one with Cech with a minute remaining, but got his second and Saints' fourth from an identical angle in stoppage time, driving the ball under the goalkeeper after picking up Dusan Tadic's through ball to round off Arsenal's humiliation.

City were the better side for the opening 30 minutes as they looked to close the gap on league-leaders Leicester, but it was Arsenal who enhanced their title challenge as two first-half goals proved to be enough for victory. Yaya Toure may have scored a great goal at the Emirates but Jamie Carragher was not happy with his performance Yaya Toure may have scored a great goal at the Emirates but Jamie Carragher was not happy with his performance Theo Walcott opened the scoring with a spectacular, curling effort before Olivier Giroud drilled past Joe Hart; Mesut Ozil providing assists for both goals to continue his impressive run of form this season - the Germany international has been involved in 17 goals from 16 games. City generated more possession after the break, and halved the Gunners' lead when Yaya Toure guided the ball into the top corner. Giroud has now scored 10 Premier League goals so far this season But it wasn't enough for Manuel Pellegrini's side as Arsenal held out to sit second in the table going into Christmas, just as they have been on the last two occasions they have won the league. The fact Wenger's side led at all at the midway point would have surprised most inside the stadium after the early stages. Raheem Sterling holds off Hector Bellerin (L) and Aaron Ramsey While City did not necessarily dominate possession or opportunities, they had the better of both without stamping their mark on the game. David Silva and Fernandinho were both off target before Kevin De Bruyne - who had earlier kicked a corner-flag while trying to take a quick corner - went much closer with a low drive. A bad night for Kevin De Bruyne was made worse when he tried to take a short corner and tripped over the flag! A bad night for Kevin De Bruyne was made worse when he tried to take a short corner and tripped over the flag! That chance seemed as though it might be a prelude for a goal and indeed it was, but not at the end many would have expected. Just as City were starting to genuinely threaten, it was Arsenal who edged ahead against the run of play through Walcott. Theo Walcott (C) celebrates with Ramsey (R) after scoring Arsenal's first goal Ozil passed to Walcott inside the penalty area and at first it looked like the ball might get caught under the England international. But Walcott steadied himself superbly before bending a fantastic curling strike beyond the reach of his international colleague Joe Hart. Giroud shoots past Man City goalkeeper Joe Hart to score Arsenal's second goal in first-half injury-time Falling behind clearly dented City's confidence, and they were in more trouble soon after as the in-form Giroud made it 2-0. Eliquiam Mangala played a sloppy cross-field pass and when Ozil eventually took possession, he once more supplied for Giroud to drill through Hart's legs and in. Theo Walcott says Mezut Ozil is a special player who made special moments against City Theo Walcott says Mezut Ozil is a special player who made special moments against City Being two up going into the second half gave Arsenal confidence and City were slow to muster any kind of reaction. Indeed, the hosts poured forward at every opportunity with Joel Campbell shooting over, then at Hart, before slipping in Aaron Ramsey who was only denied a brilliant team goal by the City 'keeper. Arsene Wenger lavished praise on his Arsenal players and said their spirit was crucial Arsene Wenger lavished praise on his Arsenal players and said their spirit was crucial City had introduced Raheem Sterling at the restart and Wilfried Bony midway through the second half but neither made much impression, with the former seeing a weak penalty claim waved away. Toure's attempt to win a free shot on goal from 12 yards was also dismissed by the referee and again it looked as though the correct decision was made. Manuel Pellegrini says he is not bothered that no team has won the Premier League after losing five games before Christmas Manuel Pellegrini says he is not bothered that no team has won the Premier League after losing five games before Christmas As time started running out, City were at their most threatening since it was goalless but Jesus Navas panicked and tried to square rather than taking a shot himself. There was no such problem for Toure, who passed a magnificent effort into the top corner to reduce the deficit and change the complexion of the match with eight minutes left but the visitors were unable to clinch an equaliser as Arsenal prevailed.

Ighalo celebrates with Watford's Troy Deeney Odion Ighalo scored twice as Watford recorded a comfortable 3-0 victory over Liverpool at Vicarage Road on Sunday. Nathan Ake made the most of an Adam Bogdan howler to open the scoring just three minutes in, before Ighalo doubled Watford's lead after just 15 minutes. Deeney and Ighalo give their reaction to Sky Sports after their 3-0 win over Liverpool Deeney and Ighalo give their reaction to Sky Sports after their 3-0 win over Liverpool The Nigerian striker then scored Watford's third after nodding in Valon Behrami's superb cross, leaving the Hornets just one point off the Champions League places. Liverpool, meanwhile, are without a win in December and remain five points off the top four - with their goal difference now dropping to -2. Nathan Ake scores following an Adam Bogdan howler With just three minutes on the clock, a swinging corner fell into the hands of Bogdan, who was deputising for the injured Simon Mignolet, but he dropped the ball into the path of Ake - on loan from Chelsea - who prodded home his first Premier League goal. However, replays showed that Bogdan may have had both hands on the ball at the time of Ake's strike. Former Watford striker John Barnes said current Hornets front-man Troy Deeney is the 'heartbeat' of the team Former Watford striker John Barnes said current Hornets front-man Troy Deeney is the 'heartbeat' of the team Watford then made it 2-0 when Troy Deeney played an excellent ball through to Ighalo, who muscled off Martin Skrtel and fired the ball into the bottom-right corner of Bogdan's goal - his 27th league goal of 2015. Liverpool's problems worsened when Skrtel was forced off with an injury, as Jurgen Klopp opted to bring on Divock Origi as his replacement in an attack-minded substitution. Deeney takes on Mamadou Sakho and Lucas Leiva of Liverpool Moments after the break, Origi's deft touch set up Adam Lallana in the area, but his goal-bound effort was superbly blocked by Craig Cathcart - denying a certain goal. A slip from Mamadou Sakho then gave Ighalo a one-on-one opportunity with Bogdan, but the Nigerian striker's effort was well saved by the Hungarian goalkeeper - who tipped a close-range shot over the bar. Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp says his side failed to recover following a great start from Watford Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp says his side failed to recover following a great start from Watford Liverpool almost reduced the arrears moments after Ighalo's miss through Jordan Henderson, but the 25-year-old's strike was tipped over by an acrobatic Heurelho Gomes - who recorded a second successive clean sheet. A toothless Liverpool were punished for their wastefulness when Deeney fed the ball through to substitute Behrami, who composed himself and delivered a super ball onto the head of the in-form Ighalo for his 12th goal of the season, completing an excellent win for the hosts. Patrick Davison and Alan Smith discuss Watford's 3-0 victory over Liverpool Patrick Davison and Alan Smith discuss Watford's 3-0 victory over Liverpool It's four top-flight wins in a row for Watford for the first time since April 1987, and that result keeps them in seventh - but just one point behind Tottenham Hostpur and Manchester United, who are in fourth and fifth respectively.

Graeme Souness and John Barnes agreed that Swansea were definitely denied a penalty Graeme Souness and John Barnes agreed that Swansea were definitely denied a penalty The West Ham goalkeeper was called into action again in the second half to keep out a powerful Jack Cork volley but the visitors did have chances of their own as Lukasz Fabianksi tipped substitute Enner Valencia's curling effort over the bar. However, neither side could find a winner as West Ham picked up their third successive goalless draw, while Swansea, who are still without a permanent manager following Garry Monk's sacking, stay in the relegation zone, two points from safety. Swansea players appeal to referee Lee Mason after James Collins (ground) appeared to handle Ki Sung-yeung's shot Swansea recalled Bafetimbi Gomis in place of the injured Wayne Routledge in the only change from defeat at Manchester City last time out and the striker was into the action early, turning Angelo Ogbonna and firing a shot over the bar. The hosts, backed by noisy support, were piling on the pressure in the early stages and West Ham needed Ogbonna to block not once, but twice as Gomis and Gylfi Sigurdsson took aim at Adrian's goal in quick succession. Swansea boss Alan Curtis said he felt that luck was not on their side as they were denied a penalty Swansea boss Alan Curtis said he felt that luck was not on their side as they were denied a penalty The Swans were enjoying the majority of the possession and they nearly made it count in the 25th minute when Gomis flicked the ball into the path of Ki, his low shot was well saved by the feet of Adrian. West Ham, who were looking to hit the home side on the counter-attack, stirred in the 32nd minute when Zarate forced Fabianski into a flying save at his near post but it was Swansea who finished the half the stronger. Goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski dives on the ball under pressure from Michail Antonio Just minutes before the interval they almost broke the deadlock when Ki's pass gave Gomis a sight of goal and, although he mis-hit his shot, Cork retrieved the situation to flick the ball into the path of Ayew, only for him to side-foot the ball into the side netting under pressure. Swansea enjoyed the brunt of the possession again at the start of the second half and appeared to be building momentum when Cork's volley produced an acrobatic save from Adrian. West Ham boss Slaven Bilic said his side showed spirit and character West Ham boss Slaven Bilic said his side showed spirit and character Moments later they wanted a penalty when Sigurdsson set up Ki for a shot which struck the trailing arm of James Collins, who had thrown himself into the path of the ball. Ki led the protests as the Swansea players surrounded referee Lee Mason but he was unmoved and pointed for a corner rather than a penalty. Mark Noble (r) vies with Gylfi Sidurdsson (l) Despite Swansea's domination of the ball, West Ham did have a few moments as the game drew to a close with Fabianski tipping over Valencia's drive and Collins heading over. But there was to be no breakthrough as the visitors were held to their fourth straight draw.

Goals from Branislav Ivanovic, Pedro and an Oscar penalty gave the Blues their first league win in three games and only their fifth of the season, but Chelsea fans did not hold back in making their feelings heard about sacked manager Jose Mourinho and the players' performances so far. Hiddink's appointment until the end of the season was confirmed just before kick-off and his first game in the dugout will be at home to Watford on Boxing Day as Chelsea look to rescue a miserable season. Substitute Fabio Borini pulled one back for Sunderland (53) minutes after Oscar had made it three but Sam Allardyce's side remain in the bottom three following the defeat, their 11th in 17 games this season. Even before kick-off at Stamford Bridge, banners surrounded the stands showing support for 'Special One' Mourinho, one fan describing Eden Hazard, Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa as the 'Three Rats'. Skipper John Terry had claimed player power had not played a part in Thursday's decision to axe the Portugese but Fabregas and Costa's names were booed by large parts of the home support before the action started, while Chelsea fans were soon singing in support of a man who led them to three league titles over two spells. Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic said the players are well aware of what Mourinho means to the fans Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic said the players are well aware of what Mourinho means to the fans But the hosts were ahead after just five minutes through Ivanovic, who got up tallest to meet Willian's corner, heading into the top left corner from 12 yards. And it was soon 2-0 through Mourinho's summer signing Pedro, whose left-footed effort from 12 yards found the top right corner after Sebastian Coates' miscontrol from Ivanovic's right-wing cross. Oscar impressed in the first half, and could have had Chelsea three up having made his way effortlessly into the penalty area, but Costel Pantimilom came out fast to block his low effort from 10 yards. Chelsea interim manager Guus Hiddink waves to supporters during the win Chelsea got their third five minutes after half-time through Oscar's penalty after Willian was brought down by Pantilimon, prompting more support from the stands for Mourinho. Sunderland struck in reply three minutes later through former Chelsea forward Borini, who rolled the ball into the empty net after Thibaut Courtois had parried Younes Kaboul's header. Allardyce's side had several chances to halve the deficit in the final half-hour; first, Borini's right-footed effort slid just wide of Courtois' left-hand post, before Jermain Defoe's half-volley was sliced wide from 10 yards. Another Chelsea fan holds a banner in support of Mourinho Chelsea fans reacted with a smattering of applause amid the jeers as both Costa and Fabregas were substituted in the second half, but despite another late chance for Defoe, who was denied by Courtois from 12 yards, the Blues held on for three points. Andy Burton's view from Stamford Bridge \"The performance was totally different in the first-half to what we've seen from Chelsea in recent weeks, but in the second-half they wobbled and showed the defensive frailties which have blighted their season. \"The fans made their point to Roman Abramovich that they do not agree with Mourinho's departure. They also made their feelings clear to the players they perceive to have let Mourinho down, especially Costa, who was heavily booed when he was replaced in the second half. \"Hiddink watched on, and now it's his turn to try and sort this all out. A strange old day at the Bridge.\" Dozens of banners were unfurled in support for Jose Mourinho Charlie Nicholas' Soccer Saturday verdict \"There's no doubt that the majority of Chelsea fans were there to vocally support Mourinho rather than the players themselves. \"Fabregas came off today to a lot of boos, a bit of clapping, then Costa came off. Those two were mentioned in a lot of the banners. I don't know if it was done with any thought process of bringing those two off but Costa got the worst of it. Chelsea assistant manager Steve Holland said this was a good result for the club Chelsea assistant manager Steve Holland said this was a good result for the club \"It takes big characters to come through these certain situations and it's very rare that certain players can win over fans. I think this will be about for quite a few weeks yet, maybe even months. Somebody like Fabregas in particular, someone they associate as an Arsenal man, they never quite adapted to him.

Riyad Mahrez struck from the spot either side of the break, before Shinji Okazaki scored what proved the decider to render Romelu Lukaku's seventh consecutive top-flight strike and Kevin Mirallas' late effort in vain. Jamie Vardy failed to find the target in front of watching England boss Roy Hodgson but history is on the Foxes' side as five of the last six teams to top the table on December 25 have gone on to become champions - Liverpool the only exception in 2013-14. Shinji Okazaki makes it 3-1 to Leicester At a wet and miserable Goodison Park, the hosts started in the ascendancy and almost took the lead when Ross Barkley delivered a sensational cross into the area - only for Marcin Wasilewski to intercept at the feet of the unmarked Arouna Kone. Barkley almost broke the deadlock himself when Lukaku delivered a sumptuous ball onto the left foot of the England midfielder, but the 22-year-old miscued from 10 yards out. It was Leicester, however, who opened the scoring when Ramiro Funes-Mori brought down the pacey Okazaki, Mahrez duly slotting past Tim Howard with 27 minutes gone for his 12th goal of the season. Just four minutes later, Lukaku fired home from six yards to maintain his Premier League goalscoring run, the Belgian now four games behind the record set by Vardy. Roberto Martinez believes Everton should be performing better at Goodison Park Roberto Martinez believes Everton should be performing better at Goodison Park Barkley had shimmied past the Leicester defence but though he saw his shot cleared off the line by Andy King, the ball popped out towards Lukaku, who became the first Everton player to score in eight successive games in all competitions since Dave Hickson in 1954. Twenty minutes into the second half, Leicester were awarded another penalty after Vardy was taken down - with referee Jon Moss dishing out a yellow card for Howard. Mahrez stepped up again and fired into the bottom-right corner to score his 13th goal of the campaign.

In the dying embers of the game, Barkley played a wonderful backheel into the path of Mirallas, who fired past a sprawling Kasper Schmeichel (89) to set up a tense finale.

Cameron Jerome scored for only the third time in the Premier League this season to put the Canaries in front on 38 minutes and Alexander Tettey doubled the visitors' advantage nine minutes after the interval with another goal on the counter. Anthony Martial's 66th-minute strike threatened to ignite a famous United comeback but it did not materialise as Norwich held on for their first victory at Old Trafford since 1989, Van Gaal's men being booed off. The results see Norwich climb out of the relegation zone on to 17 points while defeat for United - their first at home in the Premier League this season - sees them fall out of the top four on goal difference and drop nine points behind leaders Leicester. The afternoon began with Sir Bobby Charlton presenting Wayne Rooney with a commemorative plaque ahead of kick-off to mark his 500th appearance for the club. And the United captain, reinstated following an ankle injury, looked to have capped his landmark day with an early goal, only for the linesman to rule his 10th-minute effort out for offside. Norwich manager Alex Neil was full of praise for his side Norwich manager Alex Neil was full of praise for his side Rooney was arguably United's biggest threat in terms of goalscoring chances, but his dragged effort did little to concern Declan Rudd in the Norwich goal on 15 minutes. Rooney's attempts to turn provider on 28 minutes saw Memphis Depay thwarted by Russell Martin's last-gasp intervention, before Marouane Fellaini and Chris Smalling failed to convert Daley Blind's corner from close-range a minute later. That marked a turning point for the Canaries as they hit United on the counter to break the deadlock seven minutes before half time. Louis van Gaal responded with 'you never know' when asked whether he will be given time to turn things around Louis van Gaal responded with 'you never know' when asked whether he will be given time to turn things around The bright Nathan Redmond slipped Jerome in behind the United defence where he skipped inside Ashley Young's rash challenge before calmly beating De Gea to become only the second opposition player to score in the league at Old Trafford this term. Despite trailing, the United faithful produced a raucous reception for their team as the half-time whistle sounded. But this did little to inspire their side as Norwich went two up on 54 minutes. United failed to learn from Jerome's opener as he turned provider, playing a one-two with Tettey on the break as he unerringly drilled the ball beyond the stricken De Gea. David de Gea of Manchester United shows his dejection The introduction of Ander Herrera momentarily sparked United into life, and they clawed themselves back into the game on 66 minutes. Young's wicked cross from the right fell kindly for Martial and the 20-year-old, named Europe's best young player of 2015, showed flawless close control to cut inside Ryan Bennett and Sebastien Bassong before rifling the ball home. The expected United revival did not materialise, though, as Norwich restricted the hosts to aimless crosses into the box before only a smart save from De Gea prevented substitute Youssouf Mulumbu from making the three on 83 minutes. Manchester United's Anthony Martial celebrates after scoring Smalling almost snatched a point at the death with a close-range header but it would have been cruel on a Norwich side deserving of the three points. Tony Cottee's Soccer Saturday verdict \"United started off well; the crowd were right behind them. It was a good atmosphere but they spluttered the whole game. \"I think a lot of the money spent has been wasted. There's a lack of confidence without a doubt. Martial has too much responsibility on his shoulders. He's a 19-year-old kid who's been told to lead the line. There's no [Javier] Hernandez, [James] Wilson to make that simple tap-in. I do fear for Manchester United. \"I think it will come [Van Gaal's sacking] if they don't get the results. Manchester United as a football club are normally pretty loyal, stood by Sir Alex, and gave David Moyes as long as possible.

The visitors were fairly insipid for much of the opening 45 minutes at St Mary's but they have plenty of quality and burst into life just before the break, as young England internationals Kane and Alli scored within three minutes of each other. Mauricio Pochettino's side head into Christmas in fine heart but Southampton find themselves in the midst of a mini-crisis, having now gone five Premier League games without a win. Saints manager Ronald Koeman had said in the week that the next few matches would be crucial and his side began very brightly. Sadio Mane was looking particularly lively and he almost gave the hosts an early lead, latching onto a Dusan Tadic pull-back and trying his luck with a low shot which Hugo Lloris did well to keep out. Dele Alli kicks the corner flag after putting Tottenham into a 2-0 lead Mane was soon threatening again but Jan Vertonghen slid across to pull off a good block, and the game settled into a drab period as Spurs took the sting out of the home side. However, the visitors initially struggled to create much in the way of clear-cut chances, a cross-shot from Christian Eriksen which flew across the goal the closest they came a 40th-minute breakthrough. Top scorer Kane soon came up trumps, marking his 100th appearance for Spurs with a fine finish for the opener - his 47th goal for the club. Credit goes to referee Kevin Friend, who waved play on as two Spurs players were poleaxed, and the ball rolled to Kane, who burst past two defenders and then skipped past a Virgil Van Dijk challenge, before calmly placing a shot past Paulo Gazzaniga. Saints were shell-shocked and conceded a second three minutes later, with their defence again looking disorganised. The alarm bells began ringing for the home fans when the ball fell to Kyle Walker in acres of space out on the right and he produced a lovely low cross, which gave Alli (43) time to control the ball at the back post before knocking it into the net from close range. Alli scored from close range after a Kyle Walker assist Former Saints boss Mauricio Pochettino was sitting pretty at half-time and the match situation meant his Spurs side were able to cruise through the second period. Southampton again began the half with the wind in their sails and Graziano Pelle had a shot saved by Lloris before heading wide from Cedric's cross. Much to the frustration of the home fans, the Saints rarely looked like scoring after that and Koeman will be worried by the lack of chances they created. Spurs looked lively on the break and Gazzaniga saved from Eriksen and sub Tom Carroll, who could not get enough power on his shot after fine work from Erik Lamela. There was a moment of concern for Spurs fans when Kane went down with an apparent knee injury late on but he was soon up and about, before being replaced by Heung-Min Son as a precaution. It is going to be a pretty happy Christmas for Spurs, who are up to fourth in the Premier League table And a perfect afternoon for Spurs was capped by a clean sheet when Lloris pulled off a stunning save in stoppage-time, stretching out a hand to deny sub James Ward-Prowse, who had got on the end of a Ryan Bertrand cross. The win was the perfect tonic for Spurs after their defeat at home to Newcastle last weekend and they will next play host to Norwich on Boxing Day, while Southampton will try to arrest their poor run when Arsenal come to St Mary's.

"report": "Chung-Yong Lee celebrates his winning goal for Crystal Palace at Stoke City South Korean winger Chung-Yong Lee came off the bench to fire Crystal Palace to victory at Stoke City. The game looked to be headed for a 1-1 stalemate with two minutes left on the clock when the former Bolton Wanderers man rifled in a superb winner to delight the travelling supporters. Connor Wickham had earlier put Palace in front after Wilfried Zaha was fouled in the box in first-half stoppage time only for Bojan to cancel that advantage out with a second-half spot-kick of his own after a Damien Delaney handball. Stoke had all the momentum after equalising but paid the price for their failure to twice clear a corner and Lee swept home the decisive goal after collecting the ball 25 yards from goal. Palace remain sixth in the Premier League but are level on points with Tottenham and Manchester United and are only behind both on goal difference, while Stoke sit 11th. Bojan converts his penalty to put Stoke level against Crystal Palace Wickham's goal from the penalty spot was his first in Palace colours and came at the end of a half in which goalscoring opportunities were almost non-existent. Bojan was quiet for the majority of the game but had the best opportunity to break the deadlock when his vicious strike from the edge of the box was well saved by Wayne Hennessey in the visitors' goal. Other than that, the opening period - and, in fact, much of the game - followed the pattern of long spells of Stoke possession punctuated by swift Palace counter-attacks. Stoke will have felt aggrieved that they were behind at the interval, and that they lost the game, but while they dominated the ball they were often lacking a decisive final pass or the invention to open up a goalscoring position. Hennessey did well to repel a Glen Johnson effort four minutes into the second half after the full-back had twisted inside onto his left foot, and Marko Arnautovic had a shot deflected narrowly wide midway through the half. Connor Wickham celebrates opening his Crystal Palace goalscoring account with a penalty at Stoke City Bojan took his penalty well and that should have been the catalyst for Stoke to translate their superior possession into a numerical advantage on the scoresheet. But Palace were a threat on the break throughout and Lee timed his intervention to perfection to deliver the decisive blow with almost no time left in which the home side could provide a response.

Gareth McAuley had restored parity after Adam Smith's opener but Daniels rifled his effort from twelve yards out into the top left hand corner with just three minutes of normal time remaining to seal a dramatic win. Tony Pulis' side will rue indiscipline which proved to be their undoing as James McClean was sent off for a studs-up challenge on Adam Smith in the first half, before Salomon Rondon saw red with seconds left for an altercation with Dan Gosling. The game was Pulis's 100th as a Premier League manager but he saw his side create little, James Morrison's volley from 25 yards flying wide. The Baggies were down to 10 men in the 34th minute when McClean was shown a third career red card, which left them stretched to their limit at the break. Charlie Daniels converts from the penalty spot to score his side's winning goal The scores remained level at 0-0 at the break as Bournemouth boasted 65 per cent possession but could not carve up many clear cut chances. However, in the 52nd minute Smith helped the Cherries make the most of their one-man advantage as he rifled a low drive into the bottom right hand corner from 20 yards out. Eddie Howe's side looked set to cruise to all three points from there on in, but their concentration lapsed as West Brom fought their way back into the match. Rickie Lambert was brought on with quarter of an hour left as the Baggies went for broke. It seemed to pay off as Gareth McAuley equalised in the 79th minute with a looping header from Craig Gardner's corner via the post, Rondon ready to pounce had the ball not crossed the line. Gareth McAuley heads in West Brom's equaliser in the 79th minute Howe's men earned plaudits for fine displays against Manchester United and Chelsea, but their resolve to secure all three points after that setback was equally impressive. Gosling epitomised Bournemouth's desire and his lung-bursting run into the box was too clever for Darren Fletcher, as his legs tangled with the West Brom man. Glenn Murray and Joshua King were both off the pitch - the latter unavailable after pulling up in the warm-up - would have been on penalty duty, but Daniels was given the task in their absence. He finished with aplomb with a little help from the crossbar, sending Boaz Myhill the wrong way but the drama did not end there as the Baggies desperately searched for a second equaliser. The frustration told as their efforts proved to be in vain and Rondon's dismissal for an off-the-ball clash with Gosling in the 94th minute compounded their woes. Salomon Rondon saw red for his headbutt on Don Gosling The result sees West Brom remain in 14th place but Bournemouth are now just one point behind them, five clear of the relegation zone at Christmas. Phil Thompson's Soccer Saturday verdict \"Bournemouth bossed this game - even when it was 11 v 11. They got the ball down, passed it. I wasn't too sure if they were going to create many chances but West Brom just got behind the ball with [Solomon] Rondon up front. \"James McClean thought he should've had a foul so he goes chasing back towards the half-way line, lashed out at Adam Smith and took him out. The crowd were going mad. \"Rondon comes with one of the defenders head-to-head and they're there jostling. Then the next thing he just throws his head at him and rightly so Mike Dean gives him a red card.

At a rain soaked St James' Park, Newcastle took the lead as Fabricio Coloccini converted Siem de Jong's corner at the far post in the 38th minute. But Villa - who are still without a win since the opening day of the season - put in a much improved display after the break and hit back with just under half an hour remaining thanks to Jordan Ayew's superb curling effort. Ayew (right) battles with Moussa Sissoko Both sides pushed for a winner as conditions worsened but it was Newcastle who spurned the better chances through De Jong, Georginio Wijnaldum and Ayoze Perez as the spoils were eventually shared to keep Villa bottom at Christmas and Steve McClaren's side in 17th. Newcastle, who were unchanged again following back-to-back victories at Liverpool and Tottenham, started well but chances were few in what was a cagey opening. With the rain starting to come down heavily, surface water was starting to build on the pitch and made conditions difficult for the players. McClaren was forced into a change in the 32nd minute when Papiss Cisse, who headed straight at Brad Guzan minutes earlier, pulled up clutching his hamstring and he was replaced by Aleksandar Mitrovic. Daryl Janmaat's crosses were providing troublesome for the visitors and this time he found the substitute Mitrovic, who looped a header goalwards, only to see it tipped over the bar by Guzan. However, the hosts made the breakthrough straight from the corner as Colback's low cross travelled a long way to reach Coloccini at the far post, his shot beating the despairing dive of Guzan at his near post. Fabricio Coloccini fires Newcastle's opener Ground staff worked on the pitch at half-time as standing water on the pitch continued to make play tricky, but it was Villa who were seeming to cope the better after the break as Jordan Veretout's left-foot drive was palmed away by Rob Elliot seconds after the restart. Remi Garde's side were enjoying their best spell of the games as Ayew's volley flew high over the bar after Paul Dummett had half-cleared Veretout's free-kick. Despite Villa's resurgence, Newcastle should have killed the game off in the 57th minute when De Jong somehow missed from a few yards out when unmarked at the far post. It was to prove costly for the hosts just four minutes later when, after substitute Rudy Gestede had forced a save from Elliot, Ayew curled a stunning shot beyond the dive of the 'keeper and inside the far post to level the scores. Joleon Lescott (right) keeps the ball away from Siem de Jong The goal lifted Villa and they could have taken the lead in the 65th minute when Gestede only just failed to get a touch on the dangerous Ayew's cross as he slid in. In what were still difficult conditions, both sides went for a winner with Elliot denying Gestede and substitute Perez firing over the bar from close range. However, it wasn't to be for either side as Villa, who will be buoyed by their second half performance, stay rooted at the bottom of the table with just seven points from 17 games, while Newcastle stay 17th, three points above the relegation places.

Goals either side of half-time from Jamie Vardy and Riyad Mahrez were enough to secure the points, despite Loic Remy's header and a late rally from Chelsea, to leave Jose Mourinho's side one point above the relegation zone. It was a cagey start, with both teams well aware of the game's importance - Leicester knowing they could move ahead of Arsenal and Manchester City to return to the summit, while the reigning champions were desperate to make up ground on their rivals. Jamie Carragher and MNF guest Frank Lampard assess Riyad Mahrez's performance against Chelsea. Is he the player of the season so far? Jamie Carragher and MNF guest Frank Lampard assess Riyad Mahrez's performance against Chelsea. Is he the player of the season so far? There was a worrying moment for Chelsea after 12 minutes, when Thibaut Courtois fumbled a simple cross to give the hosts a chance to open the scoring. He gathered at the second time of asking, but it was symptomatic of the Blues' stuttering season so far. Both sides were forced into early changes, with Danny Drinkwater and Eden Hazard picking up injures after fairly innocuous challenges. Leicester players celebrate Riyad Mahrez's stunning goal to double the lead The Leicester midfielder was replaced by Andy King midway through the first half after pulling his hamstring, and Hazard had to make way for Pedro after appearing to injure his hip just a few minutes later. The match came to life shortly after the half-hour mark, when Leicester took the lead from another counter-attack. Unsurprisingly, it was Mahrez and Vardy linking up again, with the England striker grabbing his 15th league goal of the season. Right winger Mahrez, so impressive this season, fired in a dangerous ball from the right, with Vardy well placed to get in between John Terry and Kurt Zouma. He knocked it past a helpless Courtois to give the Foxes the lead, as chants of \"we are top of the league\" rang around the King Power Stadium. Almost immediately Chelsea broke away looking to level things up, with manager Mourinho looking less than impressed on the sidelines. Jose Mourinho feels Chelsea's chances of making the top four have gone after their 2-1 defeat to Leicester on Monday Night Football Jose Mourinho feels Chelsea's chances of making the top four have gone after their 2-1 defeat to Leicester on Monday Night Football Willian whipped a corner in from the right for Nemanja Matic to rise above the defence, but his looping header could only clip off the top of the bar. The onus was on Chelsea to push for a leveller, but it was Leicester who continued to look dangerous. Eden Hazard controls the ball under pressure from Leicester's Danny Simpson Just three minutes after the break, Mahrez grabbed his 11th of the campaign to double the home side's lead. The ball came across to the Algerian winger at the back post, who found himself in acres of space. Quickly he was closed down by Cesar Azpilicueta, but the in-form Leicester man turned the defender left and right, before curling the ball into the far corner. Mourinho's men did carve some chances, and much of the second half pressure was theirs. Pedro almost pulled one back when the ball fell to him in the box, but his effort was high and wide. Keeper Kasper Schmeichel came to the rescue just seconds later when Diego Costa found himself one-on-one. The Chelsea man did everything he could, but Schmeichel made himself big and diverted the ball over the bar. Watch as Diego Costa tells his Chelsea team-mates they're sleeping in defence! Watch as Diego Costa tells his Chelsea team-mates they're sleeping in defence! The away side's best chance came from the resulting corner, when the ball fell to Branislav Ivanovic, unmarked at the back post. Two yards out, and with an empty net to aim at, the ball bounced off the defender's heel and was cleared. Chelsea got the goal they were looking for, but it proved to be too little, too late for last season's Premier League champions. An inch-perfect ball from Pedro from the left found substitute Remy, who powered a header into the back of the net.

Leicester manager Claudio Ranieri says his players' belief in each other helped them to seal a 2-1 win over Chelsea. Despite more late pressure, a spirited performance from Leicester earned them three more points, taking them to 35 for the season. 16 matches, and 10 wins from them, while Chelsea's struggles continue at the other end of the table.

Villa Arsenal cruised to a 2-0 victory at Aston Villa to move to the top of the Premier League, plunging Villa further into the relegation mire in the process. The Gunners looked in control right from the word go, and it wasn't long before they took the lead, with Olivier Giroud converting from the spot after Theo Walcott had been fouled by a clumsy Alan Hutton. Aaron Ramsey and Petr Cech were delighted with the Gunners' win at Villa Park Aaron Ramsey and Petr Cech were delighted with the Gunners' win at Villa Park Aaron Ramsey then tapped in following a swift Arsenal counter to double his side's lead after 38 minutes - making the second half a mere procession. With Leicester in action against Chelsea in the Monday Night Football, another three points at Villa Park sees Arsene Wenger's men sit top of the pile, at least temporarily, but leaves Villa with an even tougher task ahead to preserve their Premier League status. Arsene Wenger says Arsenal's 2-0 win at Villa Park has completed a great week for the club Arsene Wenger says Arsenal's 2-0 win at Villa Park has completed a great week for the club Arsenal travelled north unbeaten on their last 16 visits to Villa Park, and they never looked in danger of having that run broken. Aston Villa players protest to referee Kevin Friend With their first real attack the Gunners were awarded a penalty, but it was referee Kevin Friend's actions that caused some controversy. Walcott's pace was too much to handle for Hutton, who pulled the England striker to the ground, but Friend took time to think before giving the decision, having initially looked to have decided against given the penalty. After Villa protestations had subsided, Giroud stepped up and converted with ease after eight minutes, sending Villa goalkeeper Brad Guzan the wrong way. The Frenchman almost doubled his side's lead after 20 minutes, but his looping header was cleared off the line by Rudy Gestede. Giroud (left) points to sky after his penalty conversion However, the Gunners didn't have to wait too long for their second - a typical Arsenal goal on the counter. Ramsey won the ball himself in the middle of the park, and Villa couldn't keep up as Ozil carried the ball forward, and with the goal gaping, the German unselfishly squared for Ramsey to tap home. Aaron Ramsey celebrates scoring second Arsenal goal After the break, the visitors took their foot off the gas, allowing Villa to come back into the game, but other than a Gestede header and a few long range efforts, they never seriously troubled Petr Cech's goal. Guzan had to be at his best to tip a deflected Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain effort wide, while Aaron Ramsey almost lofted the ball over Guzan late on to complete a perfect afternoon for the Gunners. Idrissa Gueye holds off Ramsey at Villa Park Cech equalled David James's Premier League cleansheet record, Ozil's assist meant he has now supplied more than double the amount of goals of anyone else in the division and, most importantly, the Gunners have players back fit, and firing on all cylinders ahead of a busy festive period. Villa, on the other hand, are now eight points from safety, and after another meek display, they have left themselves with a mountain to climb to remain a Premier League outfit next season.

Jordan Henderson put Liverpool ahead after 21 minutes, before Craig Dawson capitalised on Simon Mignolet's error to level nine minutes later. West Brom saw Jonas Olsson's volley on the stroke of half-time correctly ruled out for offside, but the Baggies defender put his side in front with a fine header in the 73rd minute. Divock Origi was happy with his injury-time equaliser for Liverpool against West Brom, but felt it was two points dropped Divock Origi was happy with his injury-time equaliser for Liverpool against West Brom, but felt it was two points dropped A serious injury to Dejan Lovren resulted in eight minutes of stoppage time, and the Reds earned a draw in fortunate fashion in the sixth minute of time added on. Substitute Origi's long-range strike took a big deflection of Gareth McAuley and wrong-footed Boaz Myhill before nestling into the corner. Jurgen Klopp made four changes from the 0-0 draw against FC Sion in midweek, and the returning Philippe Coutinho played a key role in Liverpool's opener. The Reds found the net early on against a West Brom defence that boasted the best away record in the league. Coutinho clipped a fine cross to the back post for Adam Lallana, and the midfielder rose above Chris Brunt to head into the path of the onrushing Henderson. The Reds skipper timed his run perfectly, finishing past Myhill with a first-time strike for his first league goal of the season. Jordan Henderson is congratulated by Christian Benteke after putting Liverpool in front The goal came after West Brom's best spell of the match as a deflected Craig Gardner cross tested Mignolet at his near post before a James McClean cross narrowly missed Gardner with Alberto Moreno napping. The visitors were level nine minutes after Henderson's finish, Dawson making the most of a mistake from Mignolet to fire past a collection of Liverpool bodies stationed on the line. Craig Dawson goal celebrates his equaliser The Reds 'keeper attempted to punch clear Brunt's deep corner, but missed completely, and after Salomon Rondon had kept the ball alive, Dawson volleyed home. Albion felt they should have gone in at half-time ahead after Olsson had a goal disallowed just before the break. Gardner was again involved, providing a superb cross to the far post from a set-piece, and an unmarked Olsson was on hand to turn the ball past Mignolet. James Milner and James Morrison look on as the officials deliberate over the controversial offside decision But after a short conversation with his assistant Richard West, referee Craig Pawson ruled it out for offside, with Olsson one of several West Brom players ahead of the play at the back post. The Sweden defender got his goal with 17 minutes to play, though, heading the Baggies in front from Chris Brunt's corner. Jonas Olsson puts West Brom ahead with a second-half header against Liverpool Pulis' side had only scored four goals away from home in the league prior to Sunday's match, but looked a threat at every set-piece as Darren Fletcher, stationed in front of Mignolet at corners, caused the goalkeeper problems all afternoon. Lovren was carried off on a stretcher after Gardner caught the Liverpool man high up his shin moments after West Brom went in front, and the away side came under heavy pressure in the final stages as the Reds looked to avoid back-to-back league defeats. Jurgen Klopp was satisfied with Liverpool's draw after Divock Origi's injury-time equaliser against West Brom Jurgen Klopp was satisfied with Liverpool's draw after Divock Origi's injury-time equaliser against West Brom Benteke slipped in Lallana, but the Reds midfielder saw his low shot well saved by Myhill with ten minutes to play, and the excellent McAuley superbly denied Martin Skrtel at the back post as the defender looked set to level in stoppage time. Prior to Skrtel's opportunity, Rondon had a chance to seal the points for his side, but the striker dragged his effort wide after James McClean had put him through. Tony Pulis and Jurgen Klopp on the touchline at Anfield And deep into the eight minutes of stoppage time, Origi salvaged a draw. The forward cut inside, and his hopeful effort from 25 yards looped up off the unfortunate McAuley and into the far corner with Myhill helpless. The result moves Liverpool into ninth, five points off Manchester United in fourth, while West Brom remain 13th after their third consecutive league draw.

lift Magpies out of danger Ayoze Perez celebrates his winning goal for Newcastle at Tottenham Substitute Ayoze Perez's stoppage-time winner saw Newcastle come from behind to stun Tottenham at White Hart Lane and secure a 2-1 victory that lifts them out of the Premier League relegation places. After fellow substitute Aleksandar Mitrovic, introduced for Papiss Cisse on 72 minutes, poked in an equaliser two minutes after coming on, Perez then beat Hugo Lloris with a low shot at his near post. The hosts were heading for a victory that would have lifted them above Manchester United and into the Premier League's top four on goal difference after Eric Dier headed them into a first-half lead. Rob Elliot says Newcastle were outstanding in their 2-1 victory at Tottenham Rob Elliot says Newcastle were outstanding in their 2-1 victory at Tottenham But instead they suffered a shock first league defeat since a visit to Manchester United on the opening day of the season and Newcastle sealed successive league victories for the first time in over a year. Steve McClaren's side, unchanged from their win over Liverpool last weekend, implemented a plan to frustrate Spurs and it worked a dream, limiting the hosts to just a couple of clear chances for Eric Lamela, aside from the goal, in the opening half. Mauricio Pochettino says he must analyse what went wrong during Tottenham's second-half performance against Newcastle Mauricio Pochettino says he must analyse what went wrong during Tottenham's second-half performance against Newcastle Harry Kane tested 'keeper Rob Elliot's hands in the first minute, but the Magpies would have scored themselves had it not been for Cisse's face, which got in the way of Siem de Jong's stinging effort. Dier and Christian Eriksen missed the target with long-range efforts and Cisse could have done better with an unmarked header inside the box. Newcastle manager Steve McClaren says their 2-1 win at Tottenham was another huge step forward Newcastle manager Steve McClaren says their 2-1 win at Tottenham was another huge step forward But Lamela should have converted at least one of two great chances within two minutes of each other, twice being put through on goal, but allowing Elliot to get a reach to both efforts. Spurs have worked hard to be a threat from set-pieces this season and a near-post corner routine paid dividends again when Dier powered home the opener through Elliot's hands on 38 minutes. Eric Dier celebrates scoring the opening goal for Spurs But they struggled to threaten Elliot's goal from then on, after Newcastle upped their energy and belief in the second half. Georginio Wijnaldum and Moussa Sissoko were dangerous with pace and power in wide areas and a Wijnaldum through-ball set up Cisse, who fired wide of the far post on the hour-mark. Aleksandar Mitrovic brought Newcastle level And while Eriksen and and substitute Heung-Min Son had timid efforts on and off target, more dangerous crosses warned Spurs of what was to come. Mitrovic equalised with his fourth goal of the season when Fabricio Coloccini headed a cross back across goal that Vurnon Anita directed at Lloris, the Frenchman parrying the ball between Toby Alderweireld's legs into the Serbian's path. Ayoze Perez celebrates with team-mates after scoring Newcastle's winner at Tottenham And Mitrovic flicked another cross into the path of Perez to sweep in a deserved winner for the away side in front of a rare visit from owner Mike Ashley.

"Norwich 1-1 Everton: Romelu Lukaku makes it seven in a row in draw Romelu Lukaku celebrates opening the scoring against Norwich Everton paid the price for missing a string of first-half chances as they were pegged back to draw 1-1 at Norwich. Romelu Lukaku scored for the seventh game in a row to put the Toffees ahead after 15 minutes. But the visitors wasted a number of opportunities to add to their lead before the break, with Leighton Baines striking the post on his first Premier League start of the season and Lukaku also going close on a few occasions. The misses proved costly as Wes Hoolahan equalised for Norwich from close range in the 47th minute. Cameron Jerome could have even won it for the Canaries but he blazed over the bar from Robbie Brady's clever backheel. Wes Hoolahan celebrates scoring with his team mates Robbie Brady and Russell Martin The draw is Everton's third in a row in the league and comes in the same week as a 1-1 stalemate with Crystal Palace in which they also created the majority of the goalscoring chances. The visitors suffered a scare in the warm-up as John Stones appeared to land awkwardly on his ankle after going up for a header. But the defender started the match and the Toffees were soon celebrating the opening goal. Gerard Deulofeu picked up the ball on the right touchline and swung in a deep cross that Lukaku headed in at the back post. Lukaku scored for the seventh game in a row for the Toffees Arouna Kone went close to doubling the advantage a few minutes later but saw his effort saved by Declan Rudd, starting again in place of John Ruddy. Norwich struggled to create opportunities at the other end and were fortunate to only go in one down at the break. Lukaku should have finished Tom Cleverley's cross, Baines hit the woodwork and Rudd saved from Kone before Lukaku fired narrowly wide. There was another injury scare to Stones as he fell off the pitch clutching his knee, but again he was fit to play on. Everton created another chance deep into injury-time as Lukaku curled just wide of the post from inside the area. Norwich had not managed a shot on target in the first half but they drew level less than two minutes after the break. Gerard Deulofeu (right) tries to get away from Martin Olsson Half-time substitute Ryan Bennett had a header cleared off the line by Ross Barkley and Hoolahan slid in to finish the rebound. The goal changed the complexion of the game completely as Norwich came to life and started to create chances of their own. Brady saw a shot deflected over and Hoolahan and Jerome were unable to turn in a corner from close range. Jerome then missed a golden opportunity in the 71st minute when he fired over from eight yards after Brady's backheel. Rudd pulled off a good stop to deny Gareth Barry at the other end as both sides pushed for a late winner which never arrived.

Wayne Hennessey in the Palace goal stopped a last-minute Shane Long effort and Southampton debutant Paulo Gazzaniga pulled off a series of stunning stops as both goalkeepers produced stellar performances.

A long kick by Hennessey found Zaha who popped a first-time pass through to Bolasie. The winger darted to the by-line before finding Cabaye six yards from goal for the French international to slide home. The midfielder had already whipped in two tempting crosses from deep within the Southampton half and Bolasie's cross/shot was kept out only by a combination of Gazzaniga's glove and the crossbar.

The Argentine, who was brought into the starting line-up after Marteen Stekelenburg injured himself on Thursday, denied Cabaye and Connor Wickham in the first half and got down quickly to keep out Wickham in the dying minutes of the match. His heroics were matched by his counter-part in the Palace goal. Hennessey pulled off a stunning first-half save to keep out a Steven Davis header and his one-on-one save from Long, who was put through by a Pelle flick, guaranteed all three points went to Palace.

a dramatic 2-1 win for Manchester City over Swansea, and moved the home side top of the Premier League table on Saturday afternoon. Wilfried Bony opened the scoring against his former club after 26 minutes at the Etihad Stadium, heading home from Jesus Navas' corner for his fifth goal in his last four matches in this fixture. Gylfi Sigurdsson had a goal controversially ruled out with five minutes to play after Swans caretaker boss Alan Curtis had brought on Bafetimbi Gomis, and the substitute striker equalised in the 90th minute, beating Joe Hart with a fine strike at his near post. Raheem Sterling keeps possession for Manchester City But there was late heartbreak for the interim manager as Yaya Toure weaved his way into the box two minutes later, and his deflected effort looped up off Iheanacho and over a helpless Lukasz Fabianski to hand City the three points. The victory puts City top, with Leicester to play Chelsea on Monday Night Football, while Swansea drop to 16th with one win from their last 12 league games. Each side made three changes as both looked to bounce back from disappointing defeats last weekend, with Curtis, who replaced the departed Garry Monk on Wednesday, opting to play Sigurdsson through the middle with Gomis on the bench. Bony celebrates his opening goal They started the brighter in pouring rain, and should have taken the lead through Wayne Routledge after just five minutes. The Swans winger shrugged off the challenge of Nicolas Otamendi and latched onto a fine pass from Jack Cork, but City 'keeper Hart spread himself well to keep the score level. The away side went close again through Sigurdsson ten minutes later, after more fine play from Routledge. His clever movement shed poor marking from Gael Clichy, but Sigurdsson failed to beat Hart from just inside the penalty box after Routledge's low cross picked him out. City's first chance fell to Bony, but the striker swept his shot straight at Fabianski following good work from David Silva down the left, and Swansea were left to rue their missed opportunities when Bony made them pay shortly after, heading past Fabianski from close range. Manuel Pellegrini says he's side have performed brilliantly having played five games in 15 days Manuel Pellegrini says he's side have performed brilliantly having played five games in 15 days Jesus Navas had done well in the build-up, cutting past Neil Taylor before his goal-bound effort was deflected over by Ashley Williams. Williams lost Bony from Navas' resulting delivery, and the City striker made no mistake with a simple header for his third league goal of the season, and first since mid-October. Navas had been quiet prior to the assist, the 27th of his City career, but that total moves him level with Silva as City's top creator since his debut in August 2013. Swansea immediately had a chance to level the score, but Andre Ayew's powerful header from Sigurdsson's set-piece was a yard over the bar. City ended the half on top, though, and an alert Fabianski denied an onrushing Raheem Sterling after a neat improvised pass from Toure almost put the City attacker on goal. Swansea's temporary boss Alan Curtis says his side deserved at least a point at Man City Swansea's temporary boss Alan Curtis says his side deserved at least a point at Man City Toure forced Fabianski into a comfortable save from a free-kick six minutes after the break, before Hart twice kept out Sigurdsson as Swansea pushed hard for an equaliser. The first stop was the better of the two, Hart smothering the midfielder's strike from six yards. Sigurdsson had looked to back-heel into the path of Ayew, but the ball bounced back to him and his side-foot effort looked like an equaliser before Hart's intervention. Bacary Sagna then went into the book for a high challenge on Routledge on the hour mark, and Sigurdsson's free-kick initially wrong-footed Hart before the England 'keeper recovered to palm clear. Swansea continued to press and the visitors had the ball in the net as the game moved into the final ten minutes, but referee Bobby Madley disallowed Sigurdsson's fine finish for a foul on Hart in the build-up. Sigurdsson had played through Gomis, and the substitute charged on goal, only for Hart to punch clear and into the path of the Swansea midfielder, who swept home, but the whistle had already gone. Gomis' reaction header moments later had Hart back-pedalling as City's goal came under ever greater threat, before the Frenchman levelled the score in the 90th minute. Surging onto Fernandez's through ball, Gomis held off the challenge of Mangala and fired past the City 'keeper at his near post, sparking jubilant scenes on the Swans bench. That joy was short-lived, however, as just two minutes later City were back ahead, and in fortunate fashion too. Toure weaved through several challenges into the Swansea box down the right, and his left-foot effort stuck the back of Iheanacho and over Fabianski to condemn the visitors to their fifth defeat in their last six games. Charlie Nicholas' reaction \"Swansea were the better team. But it's a slice of luck. Joe Hart made at least four or five top class saves in pressured situations. It was Hart that kept them in the game. \"But they never looked up for it from kick-off. They were all holding each other, they were cold, and the look on their face was that they didn't want to be here, and that's the way they played. \"When Swansea equalised you thought 'justice', they deserved it. Alan Curtis is sitting there with the biggest grin you've ever seen, and understandably so. \"But they are a jammy, jammy side tonight, City. Otamendi and Mangala struggled, because they had Routledge in between them. They couldn't decide who was going to mark him, there was no communication between the two of them. \"Sterling taken off at half-time, Silva taken off in the second half, they don't look like winning the title at all, but they've got three points.\" Player ratings Manchester City: Hart (6), Sagna (5), Otamendi (6), Mangala (5), Clichy (6), Toure (6), Fernandinho (6), Navas (6), Silva (6), Sterling

as they defeated Sunderland 1-0 at the Stadium of Light. Sunderland started poorly and were stunned by Ighalo's strike in the fourth minute and, though they improved in the second half, they could not convert their chances and remain second from bottom in the league table. The game's only goal came as full-back Allan Nyom drove to the by-line and pulled the ball back for Ighalo, who outmuscled Coates at the near post and poked home from close range to score for the third consecutive league game. Watford's Odion Ighalo scored the only goal of the game for Watford as they beat Sunderland 1-0 at the Stadium of Light. Watford's Odion Ighalo scored the only goal of the game for Watford as they beat Sunderland 1-0 at the Stadium of Light. Sunderland began the game in a 3-4-3 formation and struggled to cope with Watford's threat from wide areas. Both Watford full-backs caused problems and Nathan Ake almost created a second goal in the ninth minute as he picked out Almen Abdi at the back post but Patrick van Aanholt made a diving tackle to deny him. Soon after, Ighalo turned John O'Shea inside out in the box and looked certain to score but Sebastien Coates got back to scramble his shot off the line. The ball fell to Abdi who saw his shot blocked before Jose Manuel Jurado followed up with a shot which cannoned off the post and away from danger. Fabio Borini of Sunderland reacts after missing a chance Sunderland should have equalised in the 18th minute when Yann M'Vila slid a great ball through for Fabio Borini but the Italian screwed his shot inches wide of the far post from close range. Sam Allardyce was unhappy with how his team were performing and made a tactical switch midway through the first half as he took off DeAndre Yedlin and sent on Jack Rodwell, as Sunderland switched to a more orthodox four at the back. Sunderland manager Sam Allardyce was left to rue valuable missed chances as his side lost 1-0 at home to Watford. Sunderland manager Sam Allardyce was left to rue valuable missed chances as his side lost 1-0 at home to Watford. That change appeared to settle the Black Cats and they began to enjoy more possession after that with Borini having another chance to equalise in the 36th minute when Gomes palmed a corner into his path but he sliced his shot wide. Watford were content to sit back and counterattack after the break with the pace of Ighalo in particular proving a constant threat for the home side. Allardyce introduced Adam Johnson and Jermain Defoe midway through the second half and both breathed life into the Sunderland attack as they pushed hard for an equaliser in the closing minutes. Defoe had the ball in the net in the 75th minute after Johnson slid him in but the goal was correctly disallowed for offside by the former England striker. Ighalo had a good chance to grab a second soon after when Coates misjudged the flight of the ball, allowing him to nip in behind him but Heurelho Gomes stood tall and made a good save. Jermain Defoe of Sunderland lies on the ground after having his long range effort saved by Heurelho Gomes of Watford Costel Pantilimon was soon called into action at the other end as Defoe manufactured a yard of space in the box and fired a low shot which the Sunderland goalkeeper did well to turn around the post. Coates produced a sensational diving tackle on Ighalo when he looked certain to score moments later as Watford broke up the field. Sunderland's best chance of the match came when van Aanholt picked out Defoe with a brilliant volleyed cross in the 84th minute but the Sunderland striker stabbed the ball inches wide. Phil Thompson reviews Watford's victory over Sunderland at the Stadium of Light. Phil Thompson reviews Watford's victory over Sunderland at the Stadium of Light. Johnson missed another opportunity in the dying moments as he shot wide when unmarked at the back post after Duncan Watmore flicked the ball onto him. The win lifts Watford to seventh in the table while Sunderland remain 19th and face difficult trips to Chelsea and Manchester City in their next two games before hosting Liverpool on December 30.

Michail Antonio was given his first West Ham start against Stoke more than three months after signing They had their moments, Ibrahim Afellay creating two early chances for Marco van Ginkel, who squandered the first when he opted to go feet-first at what would have been a free header six yards out. The second was a sitter, shanked wide of the near post, and Marko Arnautovic missed the same upright from a similar distance after Afellay and Glen Johnson opened up West Ham's left-hand side. The home side's list of absentees is well-documented, but they summoned a forgotten man for a first start as Michail Antonio - subject of a spoof 'missing persons' poster recently - was given a first start more than three months after a £7m transfer from Nottingham Forest. Marko Arnautovic missed a first-half chance to give Stoke the lead The winger's unrefined menace was West Ham's likeliest source of a first-half breakthrough, and a second-half snapshot stung Jack Butland's palms on what was an encouraging full debut. Andy Carroll's team-mates adapted to his style in the second half, but twice he was denied clean headers at goal by decent Stoke defending, and the best chances continued to come at the other end. Arnautovic's free-kick clipped Cheikhou Kouyate before cannoning the crossbar and substitute Mame Diouf, on with Jon Walters as the Barca blueprint was reworked in search of a winner, side-footed Johnson's pass straight at Adrian. Stoke boss Mark Hughes says he was shocked his side or opponents West Ham failed to score Stoke boss Mark Hughes says he was shocked his side or opponents West Ham failed to score Diouf repeated the trick in the last minute when a perfect Arnautovic ball sent him through, but West Ham gave as good as they got in a five-minute ding-dong at the end, and Butland was beaten when Mauro Zarate's shot bent back to hit his left-hand post. The goalkeeper's impressive assurance deserted him in added time as he spilled a corner, but Stoke's massed defence came to his aid as Kouyate's header was kept out on the goal-line.

"Josh King's second-half strike saw Bournemouth beat Manchester United Josh King's second-half strike saw Bournemouth beat Manchester United 2-1 at the Vitality Stadium to increase the pressure on visiting manager Louis van Gaal. The home side enjoyed a dream start when Junior Stanislas scored direct from a corner, only for Marouane Fellaini to net a scruffy equaliser midway through the first half. However, former United striker King made it a miserable week for his old team by grabbing the winner nine minutes after half-time as the visitors missed the chance to move level with Manchester City at the top of the table, while Bournemouth move up to 14th. United arrived on the South Coast without nine first-team regulars, meaning van Gaal handed Premier League debuts to both Cameron Borthwick-Jackson and Guillermo Varela in what was a makeshift back four. David de Gea was caught out from an early corner And United made the worst possible start after falling behind after just two minutes, with Bournemouth's opener came direct from a Stanislas corner kick. The in-form forward swung the ball in from the left and somehow United goalkeeper David de Gea lost its flight in the swirling conditions, before it dropped into the back of the net over the backpedalling Spaniard and Anthony Martial standing on the goal-line. United responded impressively to the shock of going behind so early and really should have drawn level just two minutes later following a Juan Mata free-kick out on the left-hand touchline. The ball broke kindly to Fellaini in the box, only for Artur Boruc to deny the Belgium international with a brilliant point-blank stop, before the 'keeper then also kept out Michael Carrick's follow-up header with another excellent fingertip stop. Slowly, but surely, United started to gain a foothold in the contest, with Martial spurning a wonderful chance to equalise after 18 minutes following a stray pass from Stanislas that went straight to the feet of the Frenchman some 25 yards from goal. Junior Stanislas impressed for Bournemouth But with just Boruc to beat, the frontman dragged his effort horribly wide of the Pole's right-hand post, and that miss could have been even more costly had Stanislas not passed up a great chance to extend Bournemouth's lead minutes later. Stanislas raced clean through on goal, but with just De Gea to beat the Spaniard stole the ball of his shoelaces as the pacy forward tried to round United's No 1, and that miss proved crucial after the visitors equalised two minutes later. Michael Carrick played an inch-perfect ball over the top for Memphis Depay to run on to and despite the Dutchman being denied by the onrushing Boruc, Fellaini found himself in the right place at the right time to toe-poke home from close range at the second attempt. Bournemouth, though, refused to take a backward step and continued to attack United at every opportunity, demonstrating just why no other top-flight team has run further than them so far this season. And Eddie Howe's men got their just rewards when King, who played for United for four years until 2013, side-footed home after Matt Ritchie's low driven corner from the right had somehow found its way through to the striker 10 yards yards out from goal. Eddie Howe celebrates his team's victory In truth, the Cherries would have won by more had substitute Glenn Murray - on for the injured King - not wasted two glorious chances in the final 20 minutes, the first when it seemed easier to score. However, Bournemouth held on with some ease to record memorable back-to-back league wins over champions Chelsea, and now United. Meanwhile, this latest setback completes a miserable week for Van Gaal and his players after their Champions League exit on Tuesday, while the Dutchman also suffered more injury problems after Jesse Lingard limped off just past the half-hour mark and Depay also appeared to suffer a hamstring problem in the second half.

scoring the equalising goal against Crystal Palace A stubborn Crystal Palace withstood a dominant second-half display from Everton to move into the top six of the Premier League with a 1-1 draw at Goodison Park. Scott Dann opened the scoring for the away side in the 76th minute on Monday night, Palace having resisted a number of Everton attacks after the break, with Romelu Lukaku hitting the woodwork either side of the interval for the hosts. Wayne Rooney and son Kai were in attendance at Goodison to watch the England captain's former club in action The Belgium striker did eventually get on the scoresheet, tapping in Gerard Deulofeu's cutback just five minutes after the away side took the lead but it was a frustrating evening for Everton. The sides were even throughout the opening 45 minutes but it was one-way traffic after the break, with the Palace defence somehow withstanding mounting Everton pressure before Dann broke the deadlock from a corner. Palace move up to sixth spot in the table, with Everton a point behind in ninth. Gareth Barry challenges Mile Jedinak Connor Wickham started the match in lively fashion for Alan Pardew's side, brushing off the attention of Brendan Galloway before firing a low effort from the edge of the box but Tim Howard was equal to it. Ross Barkley was next to try his luck for the home side, linking up well with Lukaku but his first-time curling effort from the edge of the box whistled just wide of the post. Howard had to be on hand to deny Wickham again after 15 minutes, with the striker sneaking in between two Everton defenders at the near post to get his header away from Yannick Bolasie's cross, but the goalkeeper was able to push the ball away. Roberto Martinez paid credit to striker Romelu Lukaku after he scored his 50th goal for the club Roberto Martinez paid credit to striker Romelu Lukaku after he scored his 50th goal for the club Lukaku went even closer for the hosts five minutes later as he got the break of the ball off a Palace defender before cutting inside and shooting from the edge of the box, but he could only watch as his effort came back off the post. Everton were patient with their build-up play and looked to the trickery of Deulofeu on the right-hand side to try and get in behind Palace but, although the Spaniard was always a threat, his final ball failed to pick out team-mates. Bolasie and Yohan Cabaye both tried their luck from distance to no avail while Lukaku looked to out-muscle Damien Delaney in the box but the defender did well to block the striker's shot at the near post. Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew was unhappy with refereeing decisions following two claims for penalties that were turned down Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew was unhappy with refereeing decisions following two claims for penalties that were turned down Everton had the best chance shortly after the break as they counter-attacked at speed with Lukaku feeding Arouna Kone on the right whose cross was met by Barkley but his header just fell wide of the post. At the other end, Palace nearly caught out Everton with a pacey break of their own, with Bolasie's stepover allowing him to evade John Stones and get the ball on to his left foot but his effort was blocked by the legs of Howard. Crystal Palace's Scott Dann scores the opening goal on 76 minutes Everton struck the woodwork again on the hour mark as Barkley's dangerous delivery from the left was whipped in with real menace, grazing the head of Wickham, who inadvertently sent the ball on to the bar. Wayne Hennessey was then called into action to pull off a brilliant fingertip save to deny a Tom Cleverley volley from the edge of the box which was creeping under the bar.

Dann celebrates his goal at Goodison Park Two minutes later, Lukaku nearly got his side back on level terms as he picked up a loose ball on the edge of the box and, with the ball still bobbling, sent the ball over the diving Hennessey and on to the bar. Lukaku did not have to wait long to get on the scoresheet, however, as he was on hand to score his 50th goal in 100 Everton appearances as he got on the end of Deulofeu's ball across the six-yard box.

The hosts had conceded eight goals in their last two league games but kept a clean sheet against a previously rampant Liverpool, who lost their unbeaten run away from home under Jurgen Klopp. Georginio Wijnaldum says the players all wanted to fight hard and do everything possible to get a result Georginio Wijnaldum says the players all wanted to fight hard and do everything possible to get a result The visitors, victorious in eight of their last nine games in all competitions, were lacklustre in attack but did have a goal controversially disallowed for offside at 1-0 when Alberto Moreno volleyed home a diagonal cross. McClaren lost his job within days the last time he faced Klopp while Wolfsburg manager but Sunday's win was a much-needed boost to his prospects on Tyneside, Newcastle still third from bottom but now level on points with Norwich and Bournemouth. Steve McClaren oversaw a big win for Newcastle United The former England manager had spoken before the game about wanting his team to \"go back to basics\" after being embarrassed 5-1 at Crystal Palace and his team made life tough for the visitors with some high-tempo pressing off the ball. Christian Benteke, who was one of six changes for Liverpool from the team that hammered Southampton in the Capital One Cup on Wednesday, managed to break free of Newcastle's defensive shackles on 21 minutes but spooned an effort from close range over the bar following a corner. Jordon Ibe takes on Paul Dummett The hosts grew in confidence as they became aware that Liverpool had little answer to their well-organised shape and Chancel Mbemba should have done better from eight yards on 43 minutes after latching onto a Papiss Cisse flick-on. Roberto Firmino and Joe Allen both fired tame long range efforts wide of the post in the early stages of the second half as Liverpool continued to struggled to work clear openings. Steve McClaren says the Newcastle players got their reward for working really hard against Liverpool Steve McClaren says the Newcastle players got their reward for working really hard against Liverpool Klopp sensed his team needed a spark and sent on both Daniel Sturridge and Adam Lallana in search of some inspiration on 63 minutes. However, it was the Toon Army that upped the intensity and their effort was rewarded on 68 minutes. Jurgen Klopp admitted he did not know why Liverpool's standards slipped in the 2-0 defeat at Newcastle Jurgen Klopp admitted he did not know why Liverpool's standards slipped in the 2-0 defeat at Newcastle Wijnaldum received a ball in the penalty area, worked the ball into a shooting position and although his shot was well struck it was headed wide of the post until Skrtel inadvertently deflected the ball over his own goalkeeper and into the net. Sturridge was released into space by Lallana on 74 minutes but he scuffed his shot wide of the far post. Martin Skrtel deflects Georginio Wijnaldum's shot into his own net Liverpool's next attack did end with the ball in the back of the net but the goal was ruled out for offside. Dietmar Hamann and Thierry Henry are not sure if Alberto Moreno's disallowed goal should have stood or if he actually meant it. Dietmar Hamann and Thierry Henry are not sure if Alberto Moreno's disallowed goal should have stood or if he actually meant it. A long ball to Moreno at the back post was skilfully volleyed over goalkeeper Rob Elliot by the Spaniard and into the top corner, but the referee's whistle had already been blown as the linesman flagged the full-back offside despite him looking level with the last defender. Wijnaldum scores Newcastle's second goal That was as close as Liverpool came although Dejan Lovren had two headed efforts in the closing stages, the defender failing to finish the chances with any conviction. The same couldn't be said about the way Wijnaldum netted Newcastle's second goal in injury-time. Wijnaldum celebrates only Newcastle's second home victory in the league this season He finished off a flowing counter-attack - spearheaded by Moussa Sissoko - by cheekily chipping a first-time effort over Simon Mignolet from 10 yards, a surprise result sealed with style.

at the Britannia Stadium. Mark Hughes' side struck in the seventh minute as Arnautovic tapped home from close range after brilliant wing play from Xherdan Shaqiri. The Austrian doubled his side's advantage seven minutes later, racing onto another Shaqiri pass before sliding the ball past Joe Hart. Arnautovic beat Hart twice inside the first 15 minutes at the Britannia Stadium Jack Butland was forced into action to deny efforts from both Kevin De Bruyne and Aleksandar Kolarov but in truth it was a comfortable afternoon for Stoke, who moved up to ninth and into the top 10 in the table for the first time this season. Meanwhile, City - who are without a win from their last four league matches away from home - would be knocked off top spot following wins for Leicester and Arsenal in the 3pm kick-offs. City, who made four changes with Hart, David Silva, Fernando and Wilfried Bony returning in place of Willy Caballero, Fabian Delph, Yaya Toure and Sergio Aguero, found themselves behind from Stoke's first real attack as Shaqiri beat two City players on the right flank, before fizzing in a cross for Arnautovic to tap home. Arnautovic pounces to open the scoring Pellegrini's men, who enjoyed a 4-1 victory at the Britannia last season, could have been back on level terms in the 14th minute but for Butland's important stop to keep out De Bruyne's low shot from just inside the area. However, a minute later it was Hart picking the ball out of his net for a second time as Shaqiri again released Arnautovic with an inch-perfect through-ball, and the Austria international made no mistake with a first-time finish past the onrushing Hart. Stoke were carving out chance after chance with the front three of Bojan, Shaqiri and Arnautovic picking the City backline apart with ease, and the Austrian hit the outside of the post with a header from Glenn Whelan's left-wing cross. Stoke City's Jack Butland celebrates his team's first goal Butland was called into action again in the 41st minute to block Kolarov's fierce drive at the near post but Stoke hit back immediately with Arnautovic - played in by another Shaqiri through ball - denied by the post again. Searching for a hat-trick, Arnautovic continued to pose a threat after the break, heading just past the post after Bojan forced Hart into a save at the near post. Pellegrini had seen enough and with just over 30 minutes remaining he threw on Kelechi Iheanacho and Delph in place of Bony and Fernandinho, before making his final change in the 62nd minute as Silva made way for Jesus Navas. Manchester City midfielder Fernando (R) vies with Stoke City forward Xherdan Shaqiri However, City continued to struggle in the final third as Stoke threatened on the break, and they should have had their third when goal hero Arnautovic turned provider, but with an open goal in front of him Shaqiri failed to make contact with the Austrian's cross. Minutes later, the hosts had another golden chance to make the game completely safe as Shaqiri slipped Bojan clean through on goal, but despite beating Hart, the Spaniard could not beat Nicolas Otamendi. City, who finished the game with 10 men due to an injury to Fernando, hit the side netting through Kolarov's powerful drive but it was an all-too-rare effort on goal for the visitors as Stoke completed a memorable victory.

Giroud's unfortunate intervention on the stroke of half-time cancelled out Joel Campbell's opening goal (33), but the Frenchman restored the lead with a second-half header (63) before Aaron Ramsey added an injury-time third. Arsenal sparkled only intermittently, and mostly when the ball was at the feet of the outstanding Mesut Ozil, but after three Premier League games without a win last month a positive result was the priority. And Arsene Wenger's side got what they were after, despite a real examination from visitors chasing a third straight win, and a stuttering midfield rhythm in the wake of another round of damaging injuries. Arsenal will now go to Olympiakos for Wednesday's Champions League eliminator within two points of top spot back at home, and with more minutes in the legs of the recently-returned Ramsey, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Theo Walcott. For long spells at the Emirates another outcome appeared more than possible as Sunderland's three centre-halves stood firm and Duncan Watmore's direct running gave the home defence a constant headache. Sam Allardyce felt Sunderland were made to pay for missing crucial opportunities against Arsenal Sam Allardyce felt Sunderland were made to pay for missing crucial opportunities against Arsenal Fabio Borini shot tamely at Petr Cech when Watmore's early pass put him clean through, and the goalkeeper then reacted smartly to stop Mathieu Flamini prodding into his own net. Flamini was paired with Ramsey in the absence of Santi Cazorla and Francis Coquelin, and Arsenal's new-look midfield took most of the first half to find a decent understanding. Joel Campbell scores Arsenal's first goal against Sunderland from a Mesut Ozil pass Alexis Sanchez's replacement fared better, though, Campbell catching DeAndre Yedlin napping to give Ozil's perfect through ball the finish it deserved - first time, and between the legs of Costel Pantilimon. But for a third league game running Arsenal threw away a lead with half-time approaching as Watmore drew a needless Koscielny nibble and Giroud deflected Yann M'Vila's free-kick high inside Cech's near post. Arsenal goalkeeper Petr Cech watches as Giroud's own goal puts Sunderland level at 1-1 Another M'Vila delivery almost helped Sunderland into a second-half lead, Cech scrambling to stop Steven Fletcher's back-post prod, and minutes later a stooping Giroud buried Ramsey's inswinging cross. Yedlin's goal-line clearance denied him a hat-trick of sorts as Ozil seized control of the game in the final quarter, but Sunderland still had the chance to grab a late draw, Patrick van Aanholt missing the target on his swinger of a right foot when Hector Bellerin went to sleep. Ramsey squandered one opportunity to settle the argument in added time but took the next, bundling in substitute Calum Chambers' deflected shot, and Wenger's touchline jig of celebration betrayed his relief at the result. Aaron Ramsey says he feels more comfortable playing in a central role for Arsenal and he could have scored a few more goals Aaron Ramsey says he feels more comfortable playing in a central role for Arsenal and he could have scored a few more goals Soccer Saturday verdict - Matt Le Tissier It was the case of grinding out a result today.

However, this was far from a boring affair with West Ham, who have now avoided defeat away at Arsenal, Man City, Liverpool and Man Utd this season, creating four fantastic chances, including hitting the post twice. It was a case of what might have been for the Hammers, who were aggrieved that Bastian Schweinsteiger wasn't shown a red card in the first-half for an apparent elbow into the throat of Winston Reid that drew no card from referee Mark Clattenburg. Louis van Gaal says United were well-organised and created plenty of chances but just lacked composure. Louis van Gaal says United were well-organised and created plenty of chances but just lacked composure. United, who were booed off by a section of the home fans, came on strong towards the end of the game but failed to finish off some good openings - the pick of which fell to Marouane Fellaini but he was denied from close range. Marouane Fellaini in action at Old Trafford Both teams came into game with injury problems in attack, captain Wayne Rooney was missing with an ankle injury for the hosts while Manuel Lanzini was ruled out for the visitors owing to a slight groin problem. Despite home advantage, United started at a pedestrian pace and it was West Ham that created the first major chance. Mark Noble slipped in Victor Moses, who was to limp off later with a hamstring injury, but through on goal the winger was denied by David de Gea. Victor Moses reacts after spurning a chance Fellaini struggled to make impact on the game on his first start in the Premier League since the 3-1 victory against Liverpool on September 12 although it was his knock down for Anthony Martial on 15 minutes that drew a fantastic goal-saving block from Reid. West Ham sprung up the other end and created two superb openings within three minutes of each other that both cannoned back off the same post. Firstly, Chris Smalling's clearance from inside his own six yard box after De Gea's spill bounced off Zarate and then Reid bulleted a header from a Zarate corner against the frame of the goal. The home fans groaned and the players were becoming frustrated with their inability to break down a well-marshalled West Ham defence and that agitation boiled over on 39 minutes. Slaven Bilic gives instructions from the touchline Schweinsteiger and Reid clashed as they were waiting for a free-kick from the right and the German World Cup winner appeared to swing an elbow which caught Reid flush in the throat. Clattenberg blew his whistle and called both players over but no cards were brandished to the bemusement of West Ham manager Slaven Bilic, who had words with the official as the teams went down the tunnel for half-time. The game continued in the same pattern in the second-half with United happy to dominate possession and West Ham sitting deep. But yet again, it was the Hammers who created the clear opening on 54 minutes. Martial reacts after missing a chance Andy Carroll cleverly knocked a ball into the path of Zarate inside the box but from seven yards out and with just De Gea to beat he skewed his shot horribly wide of the far post. From that moment on, it was the hosts who went on the front-foot. Jesse Lingard and Martial cut open the West Ham defence down the left on 59 minutes and Lingard sent in a cross that Fellaini looked set to finish, but Adrian dived at his feet and made a brave block. Morgan Schneiderlin holds off Alex Song Van Gaal threw on Memphis Depay in a bid for a late winner and he nearly made the desired impact with 10 minutes left. His trickery down the left made space to find Martial inside the box, who took the shot first time from 12 yards but it drifted agonisingly wide. Lingard then flashed a half-volley wide of the post before Smalling had one last chance in injury time but his shot from eight yards was scrambled clear by the brave West Ham rearguard, who were the heartbeat of another fantastic away performance. Soccer Saturday reaction - Charlie Nicholas Today it was finishing. It was actually quite an enjoyable 0-0. It wasn't a boring, slow passing day for Manchester United. They started sharply, it was quite bright. They brought Fellaini in and played him just behind Martial. He was heavily involved in the game throughout, both in controversial situations with a nasty challenge on Tomkins and he had two or three lovely knockdowns for Martial in particular. For a spell it was West Ham who were dogged defensively. We know about their injury situation but when Zarate got the ball there was a little bit of hope and expectation. They hit the same post twice within a minute. The best chances for Manchester United? Martial sliding one wide, Fellaini probably should've scored from about eight yards, didn't get a really good connection which Adrian did well to save. The best chance by a mile was Zarate for West Ham. It was a good, solid, workman-like performance from them. This was to do with Manchester United's finishing. They all had attempts but very rarely did they actually get close to the target. Slaven Bilic felt Bastian Schweinsteiger should have been sent-off after catching Winston Reid with an elbow.

Villa just before half-time Bottom club Aston Villa held Southampton to a hard-fought 1-1 draw at St Mary's, but remain without a win in 14 Premier League games. Joleon Lescott put Villa ahead just before half-time from close range, but Saints equalised in the 73rd minute through substitute Oriol Romeu's half-volley from a corner. Saints had numerous chances to grab a win, but the result leaves Villa still rooted to the bottom of the Premier League with six points, and their winless run goes on, while Saints drop to 12th. Sadio Mane and Leandro Bacuna battle at St Mary's Southampton dominated the early stages, and had four clear opportunities to take the lead in the first half. Dusan Tadic blazed over the bar from 12 yards after three minutes following Sadio Mane's pull back, before Graziano Pelle's effort went the same way from Tadic's pinpoint cross two minutes later. Then, after Brad Guzan's poor punch found its way to Jose Fonte, the defender's effort was superbly turned over the bar by Rudy Gestede, and from the following corner Mane somehow headed over unmarked at the far post from four yards. Ronald Koeman felt Southampton should have scored a few goals before Aston Villa took the lead Ronald Koeman felt Southampton should have scored a few goals before Aston Villa took the lead But against the run of play Villa scored a minute before half-time, Lescott turning home Jordan Veretout's corner from four yards following some poor Southampton defending. Saints picked up their dominance in the second half, and should have been level on 65 minutes through former Villa midfielder Steven Davis, but his close-range effort was superbly blocked by Alan Hutton. Guzan was then at his best to deny Juanmi's 20-yard effort, but the hosts got their equaliser with 17 minutes remaining. Substitute Romeu, who had been introduced just 10 minutes earlier, got on the end of James Ward-Prowse's corner at the far post to stab home into the bottom left corner past Guzan. Remi Garde says his Aston Villa players showed good spirit as they claimed a draw at Southampton Remi Garde says his Aston Villa players showed good spirit as they claimed a draw at Southampton It was struggling Villa who had the best chance to win the game through Ashley Westwood, but the substitute sliced his left-footed effort wide of the far post following Carlos Sanchez's deft cross. Despite late pressure in their area, Villa held on to earn their first away point since the opening day of the season, while Ronald Koeman's Southampton are now without a win in four games in all competitions. Soccer Saturday verdict - Phil Thompson I must say Jordan Ayew, who I thought wasn't good enough for the Premier League, he was an absolute star today, he was excellent. He played on the left, got hold of the ball, showed great pace to go forward with it. When he went down the middle when Gestede went off he was excellent. All round, I thought it was a very good point for Aston Villa. Phil Thompson gives his thoughts on the 1-1 draw between Southampton and Aston Villa at St Marys Phil Thompson gives his thoughts on the 1-1 draw between Southampton and Aston Villa at St Marys Tadic, Mane and Pelle all had very good chances and that was it in this game. Southampton are just lacking that little bit of clinical finishing, and it's just missing at the moment. It was a good point but there's a lot wrong with this Villa side. They grew in confidence but it's still not enough. They still look as though there's not enough in these players to get out of trouble.

Premier League as they crushed Swansea 3-0 at the Liberty Stadium. The away side blew their hosts away in the first half as a double from the Algerian midfielder left his team well-placed at the break, even though the scoreline could have been much more emphatic after 45 minutes. Swansea started the second half with more intent and purpose but another Mahrez strike with a little over 20 minutes remaining settled the contest. Vardy had his share of chances in both halves but could not force his 12th goal in 12 consecutive Premier League games as Leicester took advantage of Manchester City's earlier slip at Stoke to go two points clear at the top. Mahrez scored the first goal against Swansea when the ball struck his back The visitors opened the scoring after five minutes in unorthodox circumstances. Kyle Bartley was panicked into conceding a corner under pressure from Vardy and from Marc Albrighton's excellent resulting set-piece, the ball struck Mahrez on the back and squeezed past Lukasz Fabianski. Swansea enjoyed a decent spell of possession after going behind but could not force any chances in the Leicester box. The away side should have gone 2-0 ahead after 15 minutes when Vardy's persistence saw him win the break of the ball off of Bartley but, one-on-one with Fabianski, he smashed his effort into the goalkeeper. Leicester did not have to wait much longer before doubling their lead, however, as Mahrez struck again. Swansea players prepare to re-start after Leicester score their third goal A quick break from the back saw Vardy trap the ball on the halfway line, lay it off for N'Golo Kanté who took a touch and picked out the run of Mahrez over the top, who controlled well, before sidefooting past the Swansea goalkeeper. However, the Algerian was lucky to see the goal stand as it looked as though he had strayed offside. A couple of minutes later, Mahrez and Leicester should have had their third but the midfielder's effort from inside the box was saved well by Fabianski. Leonardo Ulloa then nearly got in on the act after being set up by Mahrez but, despite taking time to steady himself for the shot, his curling effort was well wide of Fabianski's post. Mahrez completes his hat-trick Garry Monk sent on Jefferson Montero in place of Wayne Routledge at the start of the second half and his side started much brighter. Gylfi Sigurdsson's free-kick from the right picked out Ki Sung-yueng but his header came back off the bar. Mahrez had another opportunity shortly after when he elected to shoot from the edge of the box instead of picking out one of three supporting team-mates as Leicester broke quickly again. Swansea manager Garry Monk (l) reacts on the touchline Sigurdsson threatened again but blasted over the bar before Mahrez did finally get his hat-trick to make sure of the points for the visitors after 67 minutes. Kanté did well to drive into the Swansea box before picking out Vardy who spun before rolling the ball into the path of his team-mate who coolly finished past Fabianski for the third time. Vardy then had chances to carry on his extraordinary goalscoring run. First he got on the end of a Danny Drinkwater ball over the top but, despite controlling well, blasted over the bar. He then rounded Fabianski moments later but, from a tight angle, could only smash the ball into the side-netting. Leicester striker Jamie Vardy could not add to his goalscoring record against Swansea Bafétimbi Gomis then forced Kasper Schmeichel into his first save of the match when he powered through the Leicester defence but his effort was well blocked by the onrushing goalkeeper. Swansea hit the frame of the goal for a second time in the half as a Sigurdsson effort from distance came back off the post before Schmeichel was called upon again to deny André Ayew. Claudio Ranieri refused to single out Riyad Mahrez and said the whole team contributed to Leicester's win at Swansea Claudio Ranieri refused to single out Riyad Mahrez and said the whole team contributed to Leicester's win at Swansea There were late Leicester appeals for a penalty which would have surely handed Vardy his best chance of a goal but referee Michael Oliver waved away the calls. Soccer Saturday verdict - Paul Merson Will Leicester get a top-six finish? I don't think so. There's a long way to go but at the moment they are impressive. Vardy, I don't think I've seen a professional footballer work that hard for a long time. He is constantly on the move. He can't be going to nightclubs on Saturday night, he must be knackered! Mahrez won't be having a little career if he plays like that every week. The problem will be January because this lad's going to be wanted. I think Garry Monk will be struggling. I feel sorry for him. They started badly. I don't like seeing managers getting the sack. I think experienced managers only become experienced by working through bad times in their managerial career. Garry Monk's got one at the moment and hopefully he'll be given time to work through it because last year he was a good manager and you don't become a bad manager overnight. Players lose form but hopefully he's in a job next week.

"Odion Ighalo (L) of Watford celebrates scoring his team's second goal with his team mate Troy Deeney Troy Deeney's first-half penalty and Odion Ighalo's late strike helped Watford see off Norwich 2-0 on Saturday. Deeney stepped up to finish past Declan Rudd after Alexander Tettey had fouled Ighalo in the area. And Ighalo netted his ninth goal of the season in second-half stoppage time after combining well with Deeney. Victory sees Quique Sanchez Flores' side climb into the top half of the Premier League table, while Norwich remain three points above the drop zone. Deeney scores his team's first goal from the penalty spot Watford started the better of the two sides, but it was a game of few chances early on in difficult, windy conditions at Vicarage Road. Norwich were happy to sit deep and let the home side play and Alex Neil's side looked fairly comfortable in defence until Tettey's error on the half-hour mark. The midfielder dawdled on the ball in his own half and Etienne Capoue nipped in to steal it off his toe before playing in Ighalo. And in trying to rectify his error, Tettey eventually brought down the Watford forward before his strike partner Deeney stepped up to send Rudd the wrong way. Norwich boss Alex Neil was left to rue a costly first-half error Norwich goalkeeper Rudd, who was starting in place of the dropped John Ruddy, looked nervous throughout the first half and was beaten again in the 37th minute when Ighalo got onto the end of Allan Nyom's header across the area and finished from close range. It was, however, ruled out after the assistant referee deemed Ighalo to be in an offside position, and Watford boss Flores looked aggrieved on the touchline as it appeared to be the wrong decision. Andre Wisdom and Troy Deeney compete for the ball Norwich improved after the break, but it was always Watford who looked more likely to score, particularly with the superb combination of Ighalo and Deeney up top. Ighalo, in particular, was an absolute menace, particularly to Sebastian Bassong who he terrorised all afternoon. The Nigerian striker could easily have had a couple more were it not for a mixture of misfortune and poor control when presented with opportunities. Finally, though, in the 91st minute Ighalo got the goal he deserved to seal the win for Watford, combining with Deeney before beating Bassong for the umpteenth time and finishing low underneath Rudd.

a 1-1 draw at The Hawthorns. Dele Alli finished from Toby Alderweireld's long ball to put Spurs ahead after 15 minutes but McClean's header levelled it up before the break. The goal was McClean's first since February and only a superb reflex save from Hugo Lloris in the second half prevented Jonas Olsson from making it 2-1. The draw extends Spurs' unbeaten league run to 14 matches and keeps them fifth in the table. While it was a missed opportunity for Mauricio Pochettino's side on a day that Manchester United and Manchester City both failed to win, a draw was probably a fair result after an even contest. Pochettino made two changes from the team that drew against Chelsea as Alli returned from suspension to replace Ryan Mason and Erik Lamela came in for Heung-Min Son. Harry Kane's goalbound effort was cleared by Craig Dawson Saido Berahino, who was the subject of transfer interest from Spurs in the summer, started on the bench for West Brom for the fourth match in a row, with Chris Brunt coming in to replace the suspended Claudio Yacob. Spurs had scored three times on both of their last two visits to The Hawthorns but it was the Baggies who spurned a great early chance to take the lead. Salomon Rondon showed good strength to outmuscle Jan Vertonghen and fashion a clear opportunity, only to fire wide from just inside the box. Spurs took the lead 10 minutes later as Gareth McAuley and Craig Dawson allowed Alderweireld's long ball to drop between them and Alli took advantage to volley in from eight yards out. Dele Alli celebrates putting Tottenham in front The Baggies did not threaten an immediate reaction but they did improve as the half wore on. They got a deserved equaliser shortly before the break as Stephane Sessegnon found Fletcher with an overlapping run down the right and he crossed for McClean to head home from close range. The goal was McClean's first since joining the Baggies in the summer but the wind was taken out of their sails slightly as Sessegnon was forced off before the break with an injury. Spurs almost regained the lead early in the second half when Alli scooped a ball over the top for Harry Kane, but his goalbound shot was cleared by Craig Dawson. Erik Lamela then headed straight at Boaz Myhill from a corner before both sides threatened on the counter as the momentum changed hands in an entertaining contest. The best chance of the half fell to Olsson as a free-kick fell for him in the six-yard box and only a fantastic reflex save from Lloris prevented him making it 2-1. Rondon then forced the Spurs keeper into a far more comfortable save as the Baggies were unable to grab a winner despite finishing the game on top.

Jose Mourinho believes that the referee made an \"important mistake\" by not awarding Chelsea a penalty Jose Mourinho believes that the referee made an \"important mistake\" by not awarding Chelsea a penalty A misplaced Pedro pass sparked Bournemouth's first opportunity (12), but Stanislas' low shot was kept out by the Belgian No 1 with King close to following up. The Cherries striker tested Courtois two minutes later after a flowing move, but his near-post effort was blocked again. Chelsea lacked a focal point throughout a frustrating opening 45 minutes, but grew into the game as it approached the interval. Hazard's stinging shot from 18 yards was comfortable for Boruc, before Pedro's curling drive and Oscar's low strike offered stiffer tests, both of which Boruc passed. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho looks perplexed as his side struggled to break down Bournemouth With Chelsea struggling, Mourinho wasted little time in making a change, bringing Costa on for Oscar at half-time, and the Blues initially improved. Matic went close after Matt Ritchie had skied an effort over from long range, the Chelsea midfielder heading over from three yards after a superb cross from the right by the bright Willian. Costa had been warned by the referee for going in late on Adam Smith, and the Chelsea striker went into the book less than 20 minutes after coming on after clashing with Ritchie. The Chelsea substitute remained the centre of attention as a Blues' penalty appeal fell on deaf ears. The striker's cross struck Francis' arm in the box but referee Jones waved play on, and Costa nearly turned in Ivanovic's cross at the back post, only to be denied by excellent defending from Francis. Glenn Murray's 82nd minute seals victory for Eddie Howe's Bournemouth against Chelsea Glenn Murray's 82nd minute seals victory for Eddie Howe's Bournemouth against Chelsea After weathering Chelsea's pressure, Bournemouth struck through Murray just two minutes after his arrival as a replacement for King. The Blues appealed for offside in vain as Steve Cook helped the ball back into the box following a poor Courtois punch, with Murray on hand to head past Gary Cahill on the line. Mourinho responded immediately, bringing on Loic Remy and Bertrand Traore, but Bournemouth had the clearer opportunities to score again as Chelsea pressed for a desperate equaliser. Adam Smith and WIllian battle for the ball Gosling and Arter went close to doubling the lead in the final moments, as Howe's side stopped Chelsea from scoring in the league at home for the first time since May 2014. The Blues, unbeaten in their previous 43 league matches against newly-promoted opposition at home, face top of the table Leicester City next in the league at the King Power Stadium, five days after they welcome Porto to Stamford Bridge in the Champions League. As for Bournemouth, they return to the Vitality Stadium full of confidence ahead of the visit of Manchester United next Saturday.

goalless draw at White Hart Lane on Sunday with both goalkeepers made to work for their clean sheets. Eden Hazard was chosen to lead the line for the visitors as Jose Mourinho opted to leave Diego Costa on the bench amid rumours of a falling out, and it was the makeshift striker who came closest to breaking the deadlock. Hazard headed over when well-placed in the first half before seeing his volley brilliantly saved by Hugo Lloris in the second. Tottenham's best opportunity fell to Heung-Min Son but his close range header was kept out by Asmir Begovic. The game began at a frantic pace and Spurs almost created an opening in just the second minute, Mousa Dembele feeding Danny Rose down the left and a combination of Begovic and Gary Cahill managed to stop the onrushing Harry Kane from converting at the near post. Tottenham remained the side on the front foot but they twice almost gifted Chelsea a chance to go in front. Firstly, Jan Vertonghen's wayward pass allowed Hazard to break and find Willian, only for the Brazilian to pick out Lloris rather than a team-mate with his cross. Chelsea's Branislav Ivanovic (left) heads the ball past Tottenham's Danny Rose Shortly afterwards, Begovic lumped a clearance deep into the Spurs half and as Vertonghen and Lloris left it to each other, Pedro was almost able to steal in. However, the centre-back eventually came across to deny the former Barcelona forward. Chelsea seemed intent on getting in behind the high defensive line adopted by Spurs and after Kane tested Begovic with a well-struck shot, they began to get some joy from that tactic. With 19 minutes on the clock, Hazard picked up the ball in space and shifted it quickly out to Oscar on the left. The Brazilian took a touch before clipping in a perfect cross for Hazard who had continued his run into the box. Chelsea's Willian battles with Son Heung-Min of Tottenham However, the Blues' No 10 failed to keep his header down and Spurs escaped. Hazard remained a thorn in their side though and beat the offside trap once more before moving the ball on to Pedro, who cut inside and unleashed a fierce drive that was deflected narrowly over the bar. Despite Chelsea beginning to take control, Spurs were still posing a threat and should have gone in front through Son before the half hour mark. Kane and Ryan Mason combined down the right before the former swung in a cross to the far post. Son was unmarked but headed straight at Begovic with the goal at his mercy. The Bosnian was called into action again moments later, Dembele with the shot that Begovic pushed round the post. As the frequency of the chances increased so too did the ferocity of the tackles. Rose clattered in Hazard to earn a booking, Kane joined him after hauling back Willian before Kyle Walker lunged in on Cesar Azpilicueta in the closing stages of the half. Chelsea midfielder Pedro (left) reacts after missing a shot on goal The full-back was perhaps fortunate to see yellow rather than red. The trend continued after the break as Vertonghen went to ground and through Hazard to join his team-mates on a caution, leaving the Belgian requiring treatment before he could continue. The first real opening of the second period came as Son, who often appeared off the pace in the first half, drifted in from the left, played a one-two with Erik Lamela and fired a shot at goal. Begovic was equal to it though and five minutes later it was the former Stoke man's opposite number who was called into action. Jose Mourinho does not expect Costa to be happy being on the bench Jose Mourinho does not expect Costa to be happy being on the bench Branislav Ivanovic was given time and space to pick out Hazard with his cross and the Belgian's left-foot volley looked destined for the net before Lloris' dived to his left to tip it past the post. Mourinho's side remained the more likely to break the deadlock and had the Tottenham fans worried again when Pedro wriggled his way into the area before being crowded out just as he looked set to shoot. Chelsea's dominance only increased in the closing stages as Spurs struggled to get out of their own half but for all their territorial dominance the visitors were unable to create any clear cut chances. Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino hailed the 'massive effort' from his team Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino hailed the 'massive effort' from his team Costa remained on the bench as the Blues pushed for a winner and seemed less than impressed to be overlooked, throwing his training bib over his shoulder in the general direction of his manager. Ultimately, without their leading striker, Chelsea were unable to find the decisive goal and had to settle for a point.

Darren Fletcher believes West Brom did enough in their 1-1 draw with West Ham to take all three points. West Ham had the first chance of the game around the 10-minute mark, and it was a mistake by Jonas Olsson that gifted the ball to Diafra Sakho, who played in Victor Moses to run towards goal. The Chelsea loanee in turn picked out Manuel Lanzini to his left, and he fed the ball through to Zarate on a tight angle but his shot could only find the side of the net. It was the first flash of what the Hammers attack had in store.

It was all West Ham for the remainder of the first half and they could have scored a quick second when Aaron Cresswell sent in a cross from the left, picking out the run of Cheikhou Kouyate, who got his head on the ball but it whistled past the far post. Waves of West Ham attacks kept coming and a Claudio Yacob mistake gifted the ball to the impressive Lanzini, who shot from just inside the box but Boaz Myhill made a reaction save with his shins. West Brom's James McClean hurdles a Carl Jenkinson challenge Zarate and Lanzini were the stars of the first half and they linked up once again a few minutes later, with Zarate nicking the ball from just outside the box, picking out Lanzini for the shot but the Baggies 'keeper was there again to make a good save. Pulis knew he had to change something after being over-run in the opening 45 minutes, replacing Stephane Sessegnon with Lambert and he was rewarded for his swap just four minutes into the second half. Carl Jenkinson's clearing header was met by man-of-the-match Darren Fletcher, who kept the ball alive, knocking it down to Lambert who shot from distance with the effort taking a huge deflection off Reid. Tony Pulis was satisfied with the draw, and said Lambert changed the game Tony Pulis was satisfied with the draw, and said Lambert changed the game The ball originally looked to be going wide but the West Ham captain, who was making his 150th appearance for the club, diverted it towards goal and caught goalkeeper Adrian off-guard. The Hammers 'keeper was kept busy after that, making two great saves in quick succession to keep West Brom from taking the lead. Lambert took a free-kick that flew under the wall but Adrian was there to palm it away before saving from a Rondon header at point-blank range, after another great through ball from Fletcher, while James McClean skied the rebound.

Moses had another glorious chance in the 89th minute and after a bit of pinball in the area, Lanzini looped the ball across the box to find the winger, who hit the ball on the volley first time but his effort fizzed wide. McClean also had the chance to poke home the winner in injury-time after being played in by Lambert, with Cresswell's late free-kick well saved by Myhill as the game ended all square in east London.

Neil Taylor was judged to have handled a Jordon Ibe cross by referee Anthony Taylor and Milner made no mistake in finishing past Lukasz Fabianski and sending Liverpool into sixth place. Klopp's side were also boosted by the return of captain Henderson and striker Sturridge, who were both introduced as second-half substitutes. Milner scores from the spot in the 62nd minute But for Swansea, it is now just one win in 11 games as the pressure continues to pile on Garry Monk. Klopp made three changes from the side that beat Bordeaux in the Europa League on Thursday night, with Martin Skrtel, Emre Can and Adam Lallana all returning to the starting line-up. But it was the men on the bench that were the big news before kick-off, with Henderson and Sturridge both among the substitutes. Liverpool striker Christian Benteke vies with Swansea's Kyle Bartley (left) Liverpool started the better, and they nearly took the lead in the opening few minutes when Kyle Bartley rattled his own post after sliding in to tackle Ibe in the area. The home side continued to dominate, with Swansea more than happy to sit back, but they failed to create any real opportunities until Christian Benteke won a free-kick on the edge of the box in the 41st minute. It was just the kind of position from which Steven Gerrard, watching on at Anfield, used to excel. And Klopp probably would have loved to have seen the former captain standing over the ball instead of Alberto Moreno, who sent it harmlessly over the bar. Liverpool's former captain Steven Gerrard waits for kick-off at Anfield Liverpool started the second-half on top again, but it took until just past the hour mark to find the breakthrough when Ibe's cross hit the arm of Taylor, who was flailing as he turned away from the ball. Referee Taylor pointed to the spot, and Milner stepped up and sent it high into the middle of Fabianski's goal. Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp says he is proud of the fight his players showed Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp says he is proud of the fight his players showed Klopp wasted no time in introducing Henderson and Sturridge, the former making his first appearance since August, while Monk put on Bafetimbi Gomis in place of the ineffective Eder. Swansea improved slightly as they went in search of an equaliser, but quality was sorely lacking in the final third as they failed to threaten Simon Mignolet's goal. Liverpool eventually saw it out, and Klopp's side are now just four points off the top four after Arsenal could only draw against Norwich.

The Super Sunday panel discuss whether or not Alexis Sanchez should have been rested, after he pulled his hamstring at Norwich The Super Sunday panel discuss whether or not Alexis Sanchez should have been rested, after he pulled his hamstring at Norwich Mesut Ozil put Arsenal ahead after 30 minutes with a fine left-footed finish, before Lewis Grabban equalised before half-time with a cool finish from 12 yards.

Mesut Ozil puts Arsenal 1-0 up at Carrow Road Arsenal were dealt an early blow when Koscielny was brought off with what looked like a back problem, forcing Arsene Wenger to replace him with Gabriel. The visitors had the better of the opening stages, and were close to taking the lead but for Sebastien Bassong's last-ditch clearance from Ozil's sliding effort from 10 yards after good wing play from Nacho Monreal. Alex Neil says he's pleased Norwich were able to find a balance between defence and attack Alex Neil says he's pleased Norwich were able to find a balance between defence and attack Sanchez stung the hands of John Ruddy from 15 yards shortly after, but Ozil got his goal on the half-hour mark to give Arsenal the lead. After Ruddy's poor clearance was miscontrolled by Gary O'Neil, Sanchez snuck in to feed Ozil, who superbly lifted the ball over the goalkeeper and into the bottom corner from 12 yards. Lewis Grabban equalises for Norwich just before the break Norwich had their first meaningful effort on goal in the closing stages of the first half as Robbie Brady forced Petr Cech into an acrobatic save, but they were level two minutes before the break. Picking up Brady's low ball into the area from a central position with his back to goal, Grabban rolled substitute Gabriel before keeping his composure to slot past Cech to make it 1-1. Arsene Wenger says his Arsenal side looked jaded in the 1-1 draw Arsene Wenger says his Arsenal side looked jaded in the 1-1 draw Sanchez, who started the Super Sunday clash despite a hamstring complaint during the 3-0 win over Dinamo Zagreb in midweek, was brought off holding the same right hamstring after stretching for the ball in the Norwich penalty area. Cech then prevented Norwich from taking the lead with 20 minutes remaining, getting down low to his left to superbly keep out Wes Hoolahan's header, which had deflected off Per Mertesacker. From the resulting corner Jonny Howson scooped the ball just a yard over Cech's bar during a period of pressure from the hosts, and despite a late rally from Arsenal, the match ended level.

Villa Park to leave the hosts bottom of the Premier League. Watford took the lead in the 17th minute through Odion Ighalo's close-range finish, before Micah Richards' header brought the hosts level four minutes before the break. Alan Hutton's own goal put Watford back ahead after the break and former Villa youth player Troy Deeney's header gave the visitors a two-goal cushion. Odion Ighalo celebrates scoring Watford's opener at Villa Park Jordan Ayew halved the deficit late on, but despite 10 minutes of additional time for an injury to Heurelho Gomes, Villa could not find a leveller. The result leaves Villa propping up the Premier League with a joint-record low of five points from 14 games, while Watford are up to 11th. Micah Richards celebrates Villa's equaliser just before the break Villa were without midfielder Jack Grealish, dropped by the club as punishment for his off-field behaviour after he was pictured partying following the 4-0 defeat by Everton, but the hosts created plenty of opportunities in the first half. Ayew, put through on goal at an angle, forced a save out of Gomes after 12 minutes, before Watford opened the scoring. Watford boss Quique Sanchez Flores says his side deserved to take all three points from Villa Park Watford boss Quique Sanchez Flores says his side deserved to take all three points from Villa Park After Brad Guzan had saved at point-blank range from Ighalo, the Nigerian forward calmly slotted home his eighth of the season as the ball fortuitously fell to him eight yards out from Ben Watson's deflected shot. Ayew then missed a fine opportunity to bring Villa level five minutes later, but he screwed his effort wide with the entire goal to aim at from eight yards. Richards and Deeney compete for the ball in the first half Guzan then saved from Etienne Capoue from 12 yards after Carlos Sanchez had needlessly given the ball away, while at the other end Scott Sinclair's curling effort into the top corner was tipped wide by Gomes. Villa got their equaliser in the 41st minute through Richards, scoring his first goal for the club from Jordan Veretout's free-kick by heading into the top corner past the rooted Gomes. Replays did however show Richards was inches offside from Veretout's cross. Brad Guzan, Ciaran Clark and Ighalo react after Alan Hutton's own goal in the second half The second half started with less action, but Watford were back ahead in bizarre fashion on 69 minutes, Hutton sliding the ball into his own net from Deeney's through ball as Ighalo looked to get ahead of the defender. Gomes then collided with Craig Cathcart in the area, and was treated with oxygen and brought off on a stretcher after an eight-minute stoppage. He was taken straight to a hospital in Birmingham after complaining of severe neck pains, but did not lose consciousness, and was allowed to return home with the squad after a precautionary scan.

scored in the 98th minute to earn Bournemouth a dramatic 3-3 draw against Everton at the Vitality Stadium. Ross Barkley thought he had won the game for the visitors when he scored five minutes into injury-time to make the score 3-2, only to be denied by an even later strike from Stanislas, who had earlier equalised in the 87th minute as Bournemouth came from 2-0 down. Everton had led comfortably at half-time after goals from Ramiro Funes Mori and Romelu Lukaku, but Bournemouth scored twice in the final 10 minutes of normal time through substitute Adam Smith's stunner and Stanislas, before the injury-time drama. Chris Kamara was left in so much disbelief by Bournemouth's late equaliser, he missed that chance to use his infamous catchphrase Chris Kamara was left in so much disbelief by Bournemouth's late equaliser, he missed that chance to use his infamous catchphrase Everton were denied the chance to move up to sixth in the Premier League table, while Bournemouth remain in the relegation zone. Both managers opted to field the same starting line-ups from the previous weekend, meaning Everton were still without left-back Leighton Baines. However, it was an injury to Bournemouth goalkeeper Adam Federici, who was continuing to cover for first-choice Artur Boruc, that unsettled the home side in the first half. Bournemouth defender Adam Smith celebrates scoring his team's first goal Federici landed awkwardly on his ankle after punching clear a right-wing Gerard Deulofeu corner, with the Australia international having to receive lengthy treatment for the problem. The visitors wasted little time in testing out Federici's fitness levels, with the 'keeper firstly turning aside Arouna Kone's drive at his near post, before then doing even better to keep out Lukaku's close-range header. However, after making a third impressive stop to deny James McCarthy, whose low drive from the edge of the box appeared to be heading for the corner of the net, Everton did finally take the lead when Funes Mori rose high to head home Barkley's left-wing corner for his first goal for the club. Everton's Roberto Martinez wonders why there was so much added time at the end of their match with Bournemouth Everton's Roberto Martinez wonders why there was so much added time at the end of their match with Bournemouth And it was not long before the Merseysiders had doubled their lead after Deulofeu fed Lukaku in the box and the striker held off Steve Cook's challenge before beating Federici from close range with a powerful shot for his 10th Premier League goal of the campaign. Bournemouth, who came close to pulling a goal back when Cook's header was cleared off the line by John Stones just before the break, were forced to replace the limping Federici at half-time with Ryan Allsop. However, the back-up goalkeeper, who was making his Premier League debut, was a virtual spectator for most of the second half as Bournemouth went in search of a goal to get back into the game. Eddie Howe says the ending to Bournemouth's 3-3 draw with Everton was crazy Eddie Howe says the ending to Bournemouth's 3-3 draw with Everton was crazy The home side were forced to wait until 10 minutes from time, though, to finally find a way past Howard, but Smith's wonder strike was worth it. Matt Ritchie's right-wing corner was cleared to the Bournemouth substitute and from 25 yards out the right-back beat Tim Howard with a curling effort that went in off the post. Almost immediately Bournemouth were appealing for a penalty when Smith was bundled over in the box by Brendan Galloway, only for referee Kevin Friend to wave away their protests. Junior Stanislas celebrates Bournemouth's last-gasp equaliser However, their disappointment was soon forgotten when substitute Glenn Murray took a quick free-kick to release Joshua King down the right wing, and the forward's inch-perfect pull-back was converted by Stanislas for his first goal in five years. Incredibly the scoring was not over as in injury time Everton retook the lead through Barkley's scuffed shot that somehow got past Allsop to seemingly hand the visitors all three points and spark wild celebrations. But in added-on time in injury time, given after Everton's fans ran on to the pitch to celebrate Barkley's late strike, Charlie Daniels was sent clear down the left flank and his centre was headed home by Stanislas to ensure a thrilling match ended with the spoils shared.

former side. Papiss Cisse put Newcastle in front, but a deflected effort from James McArthur levelled the game for Palace then Yannick Bolasie and Wilfried Zaha put them in charge before half-time. Bolasie then struck again just after the break, before McArthur added his second with the last kick of the game to pile the pressure on Newcastle boss Steve McClaren, whose side dropped into the relegation zone. James McArthur (right) celebrates scoring Palace's opener Palace started stronger but Newcastle took the lead after 10 minutes. Right-back Daryl Janmaat skipped past Jason Puncheon, cut inside and dinked a ball into the path of Cisse in the box, who peeled away from the Palace centre-backs to head home in acres of space. Cisse had a decent effort almost immediately to double their lead, but it was Palace who struck the next blow just four minutes later. Crystal Palace's Yannick Bolasie (left) celebrates scoring his side's second goal Wickham did well to find McArthur on the edge of the area, and the midfielder's effort took an almighty deflection off Paul Dummett before it span away from helpless Magpies goalkeeper Rob Elliot, who had dived the other way, and into the net. Palace were looking a threat every time they went forward and, three minutes after they had levelled, Pardew's side were in front. Alan Pardew says Crystal Palace caused problems everywhere for Newcastle and in particular praised striker Connor Wickham Alan Pardew says Crystal Palace caused problems everywhere for Newcastle and in particular praised striker Connor Wickham Wickham again was at the heart of it, getting down the right before cutting the ball back into the path of Zaha. The winger failed to control it properly but it slipped into the path of Bolasie, who fired in from 10 yards. Palace were rampant, counter-attacking fiercely as their trio of Puncheon, Bolasie and Zaha constantly switched back and forth to cause all kinds of problems for Newcastle, and four minutes before the break they had their third through Zaha. Wickham, excellent all half after a disappointing display against Sunderland on Monday night, got to the byline again before lifting one into the box for Zaha, who slammed his effort into the ground before it bounced up and into the top corner of Elliot's goal. It was a terrific overall display from the former Manchester United man, which was only tainted by some theatrics a few moments before his goal that saw him booked for simulation as he tried to win a penalty. Wilfried Zaha (right) put Palace 3-1 up before half-time Newcastle made a change at the break, throwing on the defensive-minded Jamaal Lascelles for the ineffective Ayoze Perez, but it failed to pay dividends as they conceded again within two minutes of the restart. Yohan Cabaye, playing against his former side for the first time, pinged a free-kick into the path of Damien Delaney, who headed back across goal into the path of Bolasie, and he made no mistake in finishing past Elliot for his second of the afternoon. Newcastle boss Steve McClaren is under increasing pressure Newcastle were utterly deflated and the rest of the match was largely a procession for Palace, who looked like scoring pretty much every time they went forward. They finally got their fifth in the 93rd minute after Bolasie again got to the byline before crossing into Newcastle's box. The away side tried to clear, but they could only get it as far as McArthur, who slammed home his second as Palace went sixth in the Premier League table. Steve McClaren says Newcastle's attitude after Crystal Palace's third goal in their 5-1 defeat was not to a level he expects. Steve McClaren says Newcastle's attitude after Crystal Palace's third goal in their 5-1 defeat was not to a level he expects. Soccer Saturday verdict - Charlie Nicholas \"I don't think McClaren can [survive this] because we know the Newcastle fans have been in turmoil under Mike Ashley - the owner. His comments at the end of last season when he said 'I will not leave this club until we're in a successful business position' - what success? At the moment it would be survival. We're talking about a seriously successful businessman. Alan Pardew could not wait to get out of the club because the writing was on the wall. The Newcastle fans won't let go because they have to support their team.\" Soccer Saturday's Charlie Nicholas gives his thoughts on Crystal Palace's win over Newcastle in the Premier League.

"Aleksandar Kolarov scores Manchester City's third goal Manchester City came through a torrid spell to beat Southampton 3-1 at the Etihad and go back top of the Premier League. Early goals from Kevin De Bruyne (9) and Fabian Delph (20) seemed to have the points sewn up inside 20 minutes, but Shane Long (49) replied and Saints were close to an equaliser during a long period of dominance. Aleksandar Kolarov's sweet strike in the 69th minute killed the visitors' momentum though, ending their unbeaten away record and giving City a first win in four games. And Leicester's 1-1 draw with Manchester United in the Saturday Night Football fixture left City top on goal difference. Manuel Pellegrini was happy to end Southampton's unbeaten away record as his Manchester City side won 3-1 at the Etihad Manuel Pellegrini was happy to end Southampton's unbeaten away record as his Manchester City side won 3-1 at the Etihad The defensive frailties so ruthlessly exposed by Liverpool were again clear to see in the absence of Vincent Kompany, but a positive result was a riposte of sorts to those again questioning Manuel Pellegrini's position in the wake of successive defeats. Pellegrini's straight bat would give Geoff Boycott's a run for its money, and the City boss insisted before kick-off it was business as usual at the Etihad despite the latest round of Pep Guardiola rumours. Man City's Fabian Delph says it was important to bounce back after a disappointing run with a win over Southampton Man City's Fabian Delph says it was important to bounce back after a disappointing run with a win over Southampton If the Chilean prefers his players to talk for him, they spoke pretty eloquently during an opening spell which threatened to overwhelm Southampton. Time and again the visitors surrendered the ball in dangerous areas, and Maarten Stekelenburg had already denied Raheem Sterling and Kolarov by the time Sterling picked Maya Yoshida's gaping pocket and squared to give De Bruyne a tap-in. Kevin De Bruyne (left) finishes Raheem Sterling's cross for City's first An unusually heavy Sergio Aguero touch meant James Ward-Prowse's blind pass went unpunished, and Saints got another lucky break when the officials failed to spot Steven Davis' arm blocking Fernandinho's goalbound header. Davis would surely have walked, but as it was City scored from the resulting corner as Delph marked his first City start by finishing De Bruyne's cut-back via a nick off Virgil van Dijk. Fabian Delph (left) celebrates with Nicolas Otamendi after scoring City's second Saints then lost skipper Jose Fonte to injury, but a revival began to take root and by the end of the half Willy Caballero had steadied his nerves with saves from Long and Victor Wanyama while watching a Van Dijk strike cannon back off the bar. Ronald Koeman sent on an extra attacker in Dusan Tadic, and reward came shortly after the break: a quick free-kick caught out Sterling, and when Sadio Mane delivered from the right Long outjumped Martin Demichelis to head a reply. Shane Long (right) celebrates after heading Southampton back to 2-1 Demichelis bought a non-existent dummy as a huge chance of an equaliser went begging, Tadic strolling through and attempting a dink that failed to fool Caballero, and a follow-up shot went wide via Fernandinho's outstretched arm. City were rocking at that point but Kolarov - picked out by De Bruyne - finished through a crowd of players to restore calm, and Pellegrini even had the luxury of sending on David Silva late on for his first appearance in almost two months.

the Premier League’s bottom three for the first time this season after beating Stoke City 2-0 at the Stadium of the Light. Patrick van Aanholt opened the scoring for the Black Cats with less than eight minutes remaining, with young forward Duncan Watmore making sure of the points moments later. Stoke captain Ryan Shawcross had been dismissed shortly after the break for a second bookable offence following a mistimed challenge on Watmore. Patrick van Aanholt celebrates giving Sunderland the lead Victory lifts Sunderland above rivals Newcastle and into 17th place, while Stoke drop to 12th following the defeat. Ahead of the match, Sunderland manager Sam Allardyce spoke of the need for his side to \"cut out defensive errors\" and build on the clean sheet claimed in the 1-0 victory over Crystal Palace on Monday. Allardyce also insisted the Black Cats would avoid relegation if they match last season's tally of 13 Premier League clean sheets and he would have been more than encouraged by the start his side made. Patrick van Aanholt believes the Sunderland players' hard work has paid off after they beat Stoke 2-0 Patrick van Aanholt believes the Sunderland players' hard work has paid off after they beat Stoke 2-0 Jermain Defoe, fresh from scoring the winner for Sunderland at Selhurst Park, came close to breaking the deadlock, but fired just wide of the post after good work from Sebastian Larsson. However, the forward's afternoon came to a premature end midway through the first half. Having battled to prove his fitness for the match after sustaining an ankle injury at Palace, Defoe was forced off with a suspected hamstring problem and replaced by Watmore. Sunderland continued to look the most threatening of the sides, but against the run of play Stoke nearly snatched the lead through Jonathan Walters. Sam Allardyce says beating Stoke, and winning back-to-back games, was a massive result for Sunderland Sam Allardyce says beating Stoke, and winning back-to-back games, was a massive result for Sunderland The Potters arrived on Wearside having never won a league match at the Stadium of Light and were denied a half-time lead when Walters' effort from point blank range was stopped instinctively by Costel Pantilimon. Mark Hughes' side have proved a tough nut to crack away from the Britannia Stadium - losing just once - but the task of maintaining their impressive record on the road was made even harder shortly after the interval when Shawcross was given his marching orders. Shawcross, booked shortly before the break for bringing down Steven Fletcher, was penalised once again for a late challenge, this time on the energetic Watmore. Referee Mike Dean gives Stoke captain Ryan Shawcross his marching orders Sunderland immediately attempted to make their numerical advantage count and only a magnificent stop from Stoke goalkeeper Jack Butland denied Sebastian Coates opening the scoring. But with less than 10 minutes remaining, Stoke's resolve finally crumbled as Van Aanholt lashed his low shot past Butland from 20-yards out following some quick thinking from Adam Johnson. The impressive Watmore then wrapped up the points for his side as he capitalised on some poor Stoke defending and finished emphatically to ensure Sunderland claimed back-to-back Premier League victories for the first time this season.

Yet, despite their four changes, United began well at the King Power - a stadium where they slipped to a 5-3 defeat last season - patiently building attacks against a well-drilled Leicester side. Louis van Gaal believes his Man Utd side could have taken all three points against Leicester City Louis van Gaal believes his Man Utd side could have taken all three points against Leicester City However, having controlled the majority of the opening 20 minutes, the visitors were punished by a devastating Leicester counter. Kasper Schmeichel initiated the move - a move associated with Manchester United of old - finding Christian Fuchs on the right flank before the Austria international produced an exquisite disguised pass to play Vardy through on goal. Jamie Vardy drills his record-breaking strike beyond David de Gea And the Leicester striker made no mistake in drilling the ball beyond the on-rushing David de Gea to cap off a flowing attack and seal his place in the history books. It was a moment everyone in attendance had come to see and, such was the importance of the strike and the moment, the intensity of the game dipped in the aftermath, allowing United to get a foothold on the cusp of half time. Leicester boss Claudio Ranieri was full of praise for striker Jamie Vardy and was pleased with his side's tactics in their 1-1 draw with Man Utd Leicester boss Claudio Ranieri was full of praise for striker Jamie Vardy and was pleased with his side's tactics in their 1-1 draw with Man Utd Okazaki failed to keep tabs on Schweinsteiger in the area and the German rose highest to head powerfully beyond Schmeichel a minute into added time, his first goal since signing from Bayern Munich. The goal boosted United and took a degree of intensity out of Leicester's play after the break and, having scored his first, Schweinsteiger came close to his second in United colours, only for Schmeichel to expertly keep out his header on 49 minutes. Bastian Schweinsteiger equalises for Manchester United in first-half injury time Leicester opted to sit back and looked to catch United on the break, as they had done to great effect in the first. And they almost repeated their first-half exploits on 68 minutes as Riyad Mahrez and substitute Ulloa combined brilliantly, but De Gea was on hand to keep parity. Memphis Depay's inclusion improved United's chance in front of goal but the Dutchman was culpable for wasting the Reds' best openings late on as United failed to snatch the limelight away from Vardy.

Defoe capitalised on a terrible mix-up between Palace defender Scott Dann and goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey to secure a very hard-fought three points for Sam Allardyce's side. But their victory was well-deserved too, with Younes Kaboul and his fellow defenders producing tremendously resolute displays to keep the Eagles at bay. The likes of Yannick Bolasie and Wilfried Zaha were full of running for the hosts but clear-cut chances were at a premium and they continue to struggle to match their sterling away efforts with similar results at Selhurst Park. Sunderland arrived under huge pressure to get a positive result but they started brightly, Steven Fletcher shooting over after a Defoe knock-down. Defoe (right) celebrates his winning goal at Crystal Palace Patrick van Aanholt then should have done better than put a tame effort well wide and Defoe himself will feel he should have at least tested Hennessey after he latched onto a neat pass from Lee Cattermole but put his shot wide. The match then settled into a pattern in which Palace had most of the possession and did most of the attacking, but found their attacks foundering on the outstanding central defensive trio of Kaboul, John O'Shea and Sebastian Coates. A long-range effort from Bolasie which went straight at Costel Pantilimon in the Sunderland goal was about all Palace could muster in the first period and Sunderland had cause to be happy with their efforts at the break. Crystal Palace midfielder Yannick Bolasie tries an overhead kick And they almost took the lead soon after the resumption, only for Coates' glancing header from a corner to be hacked off the line by Yohan Cabaye. However, Palace took charge for a period after that and a swerving long range effort from Cabaye drew a decent save from Pantilimon. Half-time substitute Bakary Sako then shot just wide from distance before picking up a knock and having to be substituted himself. Defoe scored the decisive goal with just 10 minutes remaining The arrival of promising youngster Duncan Watmore from the bench gave Sunderland a lift and he did really well down the right in a move which ended in his fellow sub Jeremain Lens testing Hennessey with a low shot. And, with a stalemate looking odds-on, Sunderland then scored a dramatic winner 10 minutes from time. Billy Jones' through-ball looked unlikely to cause any problems but Dann tried to shepherd it back to his keeper rather than hoof clear, before inadvertently touching it past his team mate, allowing the predatory Defoe to slide the ball into the empty net. Palace were roused and almost levelled moments later but Pantilimon did really well to keep out a powerful Cabaye drive.

The three points were celebrated with raucous delight by the travelling Sunderland contingent and, although the Black Cats are not out of the bottom three, they are up to 18th, just a point behind Newcastle. Palace remain 10th but there was one piece of good news for the hosts, forward Marouane Chamakh coming off the bench to make his first appearance of the season, having recovered from injury.

Danny Rose ignited the game on 14 minutes with a thumping tackle on former Arsenal man Carl Jenkinson and the home fans responded. Harry Kane scores Tottenham's third goal Spurs increased the intensity and Christian Eriksen tested Adrian from 25 yards with a stinging drive that the West Ham goalkeeper palmed away. But he was picking the ball out of his net minutes later. Mauricio Pochettino expressed his pride in seeing his Tottenham side's progress on display in their 4-1 rout of West Ham Mauricio Pochettino expressed his pride in seeing his Tottenham side's progress on display in their 4-1 rout of West Ham Kane has scored more goals per game in Premier League London derbies than any other player and added to his impressive tally when he received the ball inside the box on 22 minutes, turning Jenkinson with ease before lashing into the roof of the net. The Hammers almost hit back immediately but Cheikhou Kouyate's acrobatic effort from close-range, after a deflected Mark Noble shot, hammered back off the crossbar. Toby Alderweireld celebrates scoring against West Ham The visitors were made to rue that miss when Tottenham doubled their advantage on 33 minutes. Eriksen produced a wonderful delivery from a right-wing corner and Alderweireld lost Winston Reid at the near post before planting his header past Adrian. Patrick Davison is joined by Alan Smith to discuss Tottenham's 4-1 win over West Ham Patrick Davison is joined by Alan Smith to discuss Tottenham's 4-1 win over West Ham With the Spurs fans still celebrating, Dele Alli came within inches of extending Tottenham's lead. Adrian was alert to divert a strong effort at goal from Son Heung-Min and Alli looped a header from the rebound at goal, only for the crossbar to come to West Ham's rescue. Diafra Sakho exchanges words with Kyle Walker Kane continued to find space between Reid and Tomkins but he wasted a golden opportunity when through one-on-one with Adrian, dragging an effort horribly wide from 10 yards. The England man finally got his second goal four minutes after the break when Tomkins conceded possession to Eriksen in a dangerous area and the Denmark international found Kane on the edge of the box. Slaven Bilic says Tottenham were the better team in every department Slaven Bilic says Tottenham were the better team in every department The 22-year-old skillfuly maneuvered the ball out of his feet and fired a powerful effort on the turn under the body of Adrian.

Harry Kane scores again Son played a perfectly-weighted pass inside the box and Walker nonchalantly curled the ball into the far corner with the outside of his right boot. Lanzini netted a classy, late consolation for the Hammers after some sloppy play from the man who had just added gloss to the scoreline but that failed to dampen the mood around White Hart Lane, the swaggering display one to spark talk of a potential title tilt.

Schweinsteiger celebrates after playing a hand in United's late winner Troy Deeney's last-gasp own goal handed Manchester United a dramatic 2-1 win over Watford in Saturday's Premier League clash at Vicarage Road. Deeney, attempting to keep the ball out on the goal-line, went from hero to villain inside five minutes as he turned Bastian Schweinsteiger's effort into his own net from an angle moments after equalising for Watford from the spot. Memphis Depay scored United's opener in the 11th minute, turning home Ander Herrera's cross, before David de Gea pulled off a world-class save to deny Almen Abdi a leveller in the second half. Memphis Depay celebrates scoring the opener for United at Vicarage Road Watford equalised with three minutes remaining through Deeney's penalty after Odion Ighalo was brought down by Marcos Rojo - the first goal United had conceded in nearly 11 hours of football in all competitions. But the visitors left it late to earn all three points, the result leaving Louis van Gaal's title hopefuls just a point behind leaders Leicester with a third of the season gone, while extending their unbeaten run to eight in all competitions. Van Gaal had said in his pre-match press conference that he had expected more from Depay since his £25m signing from PSV in the summer, and the forward duly responded. Depay turns home Ander Herrera's cross in the 11th minute Getting on the end of Herrera's fine first-time cross from the right, Depay turned the ball home into the top corner from eight yards with his left foot for his fifth goal in a United shirt. Watford were nearly level 10 minutes later after Ashley Young's slip allowed Deeney to play Ighalo through, but after turning Schweinsteiger, his effort was sliced wide of De Gea's goal. Depay was impressive throughout the afternoon and nearly sneaked in a second just before the break from 20 yards, but for Heurelho Gomes' save. Troy Deeney celebrates scoring Watford's equaliser at Vicarage Road Gomes was again at his best just a minute into the second half, turning Jesse Lingard's shot past the post after the youngster was put through on goal by Depay. At the other end, Deeney's blistering effort on the half volley forced a save out of De Gea, as the league's joint-best defence was tested by the home side. De Gea was again at his best with 20 minutes remaining, getting down brilliantly to his right to turn away Abdi's deflected shot off the head of Chris Smalling. Lingard, who scored his first senior United goal against West Brom a fortnight ago, should have had his second late on, but his lofted effort after being put through on goal by Daley Blind fell into Gomes' grateful hands. Manchester United's Ashley Young was returning to his old club for the first time Referee Robert Madley then handed Watford a penalty with five minutes remaining after Rojo brought down Ighalo, who had his back to goal, allowing Deeney to slip the ball down the middle of De Gea's net to equalise from the spot. Smalling nearly put United immediately back in front, but Gomes was again equal to his flicked effort inside the area, acrobatically turning the ball behind. But with stoppage-time approaching, Gomes parried Lingard's effort across goal into the path of Schweinsteiger from an acute angle, and the German's effort was turned over the line by Deeney to hand United the victory.

Chelsea were starting to look more like the side that won the title last season, playmaker Eden Hazard - whom Mourinho had opted to field in the hole behind Costa - increasingly pulling the strings. Costa missed two great chances to open the scoring, firstly when shooting over from six yards out after good work down the left flank by Pedro, before Norwich goalkeeper John Ruddy denied the Brazil-born striker with a brilliant save. But Costa - who had scored eight times at the same stage of the previous campaign - should not have given Ruddy any chance from just six yards out. Norwich City boss Alex Neil says his side should have had a penalty in their 1-0 defeat to Chelsea Norwich City boss Alex Neil says his side should have had a penalty in their 1-0 defeat to Chelsea The visitors could also have found the net when right-back Andre Wisdom set up Sebastien Bassong with a great opening minutes before half-time. But luckily for Chelsea, captain John Terry was in the right place to make a desperate goal-saving block after Brady had picked him out perfectly at the far post. The second half started much as the first had ended, with Chelsea pressing their opponents back towards their own goal, before they eventually made the breakthrough after some clever thinking by Cesc Fabregas. Youssouf Mulumbu and Nemanja Matic battle for the ball The Spaniard took a quick free-kick near the halfway line to catch the Norwich defence napping, Costa then making no mistake with a close-range finish to end a recent drought of six games without a goal. Chelsea could have soon doubled their lead when Kurt Zouma flicked Willian's free-kick on to the bar, while Begovic - a virtual spectator in the second period - kept his concentration to turn behind Robbie Brady's curling effort from the edge of the box. Both teams had penalty appeals turned down by referee Craig Pawson, Chelsea when Pedro and Costa were bundled over in the box towards the end of each half, while Norwich felt Brady had been impeded by Willian 12 minutes before the break. Diego Costa scores for Chelsea The Blues nearly added a second late on after a powerful run past a posse of Norwich players by Nemanja Matic, only for Ruddy to thwart the Serb with a good stop at his post. But Mourinho punched the air in relief as his side saw the game out for a deserved and much-needed three points that lifts them up to 15th in the table.

second goal of the game Romelu Lukaku and Ross Barkley scored two goals apiece as Everton cruised to a 4-0 victory over Aston Villa at Goodison Park. Lukaku became the fifth player to score 50 Premier League goals before the age of 23, converting Seamus Coleman's cross with a difficult glancing header midway through the first half after Barkley had set the hosts on their way. Barkley sealed a fine move to put his side 3-0 up at the break before Lukaku wrapped up the scoring to seal a win that lifts Everton to seventh, Villa cast adrift at the foot of the Premier League with just five points. It was Retro Day at Goodison Park - supporters given traditional rattles - and Barkley's 17th-minute opener would certainly have delighted the famous Everton side of the 1980s. Everton's Ross Barkley celebrates scoring his side's third goal Lukaku, John Stones, James McCarthy and Gerard Deulofeu all combined, Brad Guzan only able to parry into the path of Barkley, who converted with ease. Ten minutes later Guzan pulled off a fine save to keep out Arouna Kone's shot but soon after he was beaten again as Deulofeu tried to play Lukaku in, Coleman's chip headed in by the Belgium striker in the 28th minute. It had been a torrid half for Villa's defence but things turned embarrassing before the interval when Everton notched their third. Jordan Ayew and John Stones compete for the ball Lukaku and Barkley helped the ball through and Guzan's indecision combined with Kieran Richardson's weak clearance, Barkley slotting home from 10 yards three minutes before the break. Villa briefly threatened after the restart, Tim Howard rushing out to make a decent save when Jordan Veretout tried to pounce on an under-hit back-pass by Ramiro Funes Mori and then pushing away a Richardson shot. Micah Richards admitted that Everton were by far the better team after their 4-0 loss at Goodison Park Micah Richards admitted that Everton were by far the better team after their 4-0 loss at Goodison Park But Lukaku got his second just before the hour mark, latching onto Barkley's cushioned pass before coolly placing the ball beyond Guzan (59). Lukaku might have grabbed his hat-trick but Guzan kept him at bay and also denied substitute Kevin Mirallas.

It's a big club, a massive club in my opinion, but as soon as it gets a decent player it has to sell and they need to replace with genuine quality. Veretout, Gueye, Sanchez, Gil... they've got to turn up and perform. It's going to be hard for Villa. I'm not taking anything away from Everton, though.

10th consecutive Premier League game as Leicester City went top of the Premier League with a 3-0 win at Newcastle. The Leicester striker netted on the stroke of half-time as he became just the second man to achieve the feat alongside Ruud van Nistelrooy - which the Dutchman managed for Manchester United in 2003 - before Leonardo Ulloa and substitute Shinji Okazaki added two more after half-time. Defeats elsewhere for Manchester City and Arsenal on Saturday meant that Leicester go a point clear at the top of the table, while Newcastle are left teetering above the relegation zone in 17th place. Vardy opens the scoring at St James' Park Newcastle boss Steve McClaren named an unchanged side for the third consecutive game, having claimed four points from their last two, but it did not help them in the early stages as the away side dominated from the off. Both Foxes strikers Ulloa and Vardy had good opportunities in the opening minutes, with only last-ditch defending and a bit of bad luck in the box preventing them from taking the lead. Newcastle improved as the half went on, but were unlucky to lose midfielder Cheick Tiote through injury after 20 minutes when he overstretched in an attempt to receive a pass. With the home side's midfield enforcer now missing, Leicester continued to push forward and Vardy had another excellent chance to score before being denied by Rob Elliot, but finally beat the Newcastle goalkeeper in first-half stoppage time. Vardy played a one-two with Ulloa, drove behind Newcastle's defence into the box and cut inside before showing superb composure to fire inside the near post. There were shades of offside about the goal as Vardy raced through onto the pass, but there was just enough doubt in the linesman's mind for him not to raise his flag as the Foxes forward celebrated his milestone strike. He is now just one behind Stan Mortensen's all-time record of 11 in a row in the top division - set back in the 1950-51 season. Vardy is lifted aloft by his team-mates after scoring in his 10th consecutive game Leicester began the second half as they started the first, with Vardy rattling the bar as he went in search for a second, and soon afterwards it was 2-0 thanks to his strike partner Ulloa. Riyad Mahrez, superb all afternoon, bamboozled Paul Dummett before crossing for the big striker, who was completely unmarked at the far post to head home his first of the season and his fourth goal in the last three against Newcastle in all competitions. Jamie Vardy says he's still pinching himself after matching Ruud van Nistlerooy's record of 10 successive Premier League goals Jamie Vardy says he's still pinching himself after matching Ruud van Nistlerooy's record of 10 successive Premier League goals The goal completely deflated the home side, who threw on Papiss Cisse in an attempt to get back into the game, but it was only ever Leicester who looked likely to score again. They did just that with seven minutes to go as Okazaki, who replaced Ulloa, scrambled the ball over the line after Elliot had kept out Danny Simpson. Vardy will get the headlines, though, and he will head into next Saturday's clash against Van Nistelrooy's former club Manchester United - live on Sky - with the Dutchman's record there to be broken.

Stoke - who have now kept a fourth clean sheet in a row on the road - came close to extending their advantage, but Xherdan Shaqiri, Marko Arnautovic and substitute Ibrahim Afellay failed to convert a number of clear-cut chances. Dusan Tadic went close first for the home side when he picked up Jordy Clasie's loose shot in the box before swivelling brilliantly 10 yards out and drilling his effort just wide of Jack Butland's goal. Graziano Pelle and Philipp Wollscheid compete for the ball A few minutes later Stoke took the lead with a wonderful team goal. The away side worked the ball from right to left, with Arnautovic finding Erik Pieters and his low, deflected cross found former Barcelona man Bojan, who flicked the ball past Maarten Stekelenburg with the outside of his boot from five yards. It should have been 2-0 soon after when Bojan's pass was played directly into the stride of Shaqiri bearing down on goal, but his effort was well blocked by Stekelenburg. Ryan Shawcross praised his team-mates' performance in Stoke City's 1-0 win away to Southampton Ryan Shawcross praised his team-mates' performance in Stoke City's 1-0 win away to Southampton Southampton became more involved as the half wore on and could have had a penalty when Philipp Wollscheid appeared to have a hold of Graziano Pelle in the box as the Italian looked to get on the end of Steven Davis' cross. The hosts had their best chance to equalise after 21 minutes. Shaqiri's foul on Tadic gave Davis the chance to whip the ball into the box but Jose Fonte could not direct his free header on target. Bojan celebrates opening the scoring Ronald Koeman's side were having a frustrating opening 45 minutes, summed up perfectly when Tadic, Pelle and Davis combined to release the Northern Irishman but, surprisingly, he hesitated in front of goal and his tame effort was cleared. There was a moment of panic in the Stoke ranks 10 minutes before half-time when Davis' lofty free-kick into the box was inexplicably spilled by the in-form Butland but Victor Wanyama could not follow up. Tadic then had another chance to get on the scoresheet after a speedy break from the hosts but, instead of playing Shane Long in, he checked his run before firing over the bar. After the break Stoke had a great chance to double their lead when Bojan's backheel found Arnautovic who cut the ball back for Shaqiri but he blazed his first-time effort over the bar from 15 yards. Managers Mark Hughes and Ronald Koeman look on from the touchline The two sides traded chances through Shaqiri and Tadic before Southampton started piling on the pressure, with Wanyama firing just wide from the edge of the box. Indeed it was not until the 70th minute - and the introduction of Saido Mane from the bench - until the home side registered a shot on target but, even then, Butland gathered with ease. Ronald Koeman felt his Southampton side should have been awarded a penalty Ronald Koeman felt his Southampton side should have been awarded a penalty Southampton pressed forward but it was Stoke who were the more dangerous of the two sides. Arnautovic could have wrapped up the points but fired well over the bar after a delightful through ball from Glen Johnson. Adam then missed the target from range before substitute Afellay drilled a low and powerful effort just wide of the diving Stekelenburg's post. Cedric Soares and Erik Pieters vie for the ball Pelle then had an even better shout for a penalty with less than 10 minutes remaining as he appeared to be blatantly kicked by Wollscheid in the box, but referee Lee Mason again said no. Afellay had two more chances in the dying minutes to seal the three points but he was denied, first by Stekelenburg, and then he fluffed his lines with the goalkeeper scrambling to get back into position having made a last gasp tackle to deny Mame Biram Diouf.

Liberty Stadium. All four goals were scored in a frantic first half as the visitors raced ahead through Joshua King and Dan Gosling, before Andre Ayew swiftly halved the deficit and then won the penalty that Jonjo Shelvey slotted home. Neither side was able to find a winner after the break and the result will please neither manager; Bournemouth were the better team for long periods but the point sees them stay in the relegation zone, while Swansea remain 14th. Garry Monk dismissed reports before the game he was under pressure due to Swansea's recent run but Saturday's result leaves his team with one win in nine. Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe was left disappointed after seeing his side squander a 2-0 lead Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe was left disappointed after seeing his side squander a 2-0 lead Bournemouth began the game on the front foot and were rewarded when poor defending from Swansea gifted them the opener. Junior Stanislas overplayed the ball as he drove forward and Kyle Bartley attempted to clear but played the ball off Sung-Yueng Ki straight into the path of Stanislas. The Cherries winger took advantage by pulling the ball back for King who tapped home from close-range with just 10 minutes on the clock. Joshua King of Bournemouth scores his team's first goal against Swansea City Swansea almost hit back immediately with two chances in quick succession. First Wayne Routledge got in behind the Bournemouth defence and Adam Federici did well to turn his low shot around the post. From the resulting corner the ball was flicked on to Eder - starting in place of out-of-form Bafetimbi Gomis - but his header from three yards out lacked conviction and Federici managed to palm it away. Swansea's Jonjo Shelvey said that he and the rest of the squad are behind Garry Monk Swansea's Jonjo Shelvey said that he and the rest of the squad are behind Garry Monk Bournemouth had the ball in the net for a second time soon after as Stanislas half-volleyed Simon Francis' cross in off the post but the lineman ruled it out for offside. But that reprieve was short-lived as Bournemouth got their second with a sublime team goal in the 26th minute. Dan Gosling (2nd R) celebrates scoring Bournemouth's second goal Matt Ritchie capped off a nice Bournemouth passing move when he picked out Gosling on the edge of the box and the Cherries midfielder coolly side footed the ball into the top-right corner. That prompted a chorus of boos from the home fans at the Liberty Stadium but they were soon cheering as Swansea pulled one straight back. Bournemouth failed to clear a cross into the box and it fell to Shelvey, who headed to Ayew for the attacker to back-heel past Federici from close-range. Andre Ayew scores his team's first goal past Cherries keeper Adam Federici The Ghanaian also played a prominent role in the equaliser soon after as Francis was adjudged to have clipped his heels as he drove past him in the box, although replays seemed to suggest Ayew may have tripped himself. England midfielder Shelvey stepped up to slot the resulting penalty in the bottom-right corner (39) and restore parity heading into the break. Bournemouth started the second half brightly and enjoyed the majority of possession but were unable to fashion many clear-cut chances. Their best came when the ball fell to Steve Cook from a corner but he volleyed inches wide. Monk introduced Jefferson Montero, Gylfi Sigurdsson and Gomis in an effort to spark his team into life and Montero in particular looked dangerous as Swansea improved late on and but neither team was able to find a winner. Phil Thompson recaps Swansea's 2-2 draw with Bournemouth Phil Thompson recaps Swansea's 2-2 draw with Bournemouth Phil Thompson's Soccer Saturday verdict \"If I had to say who were the best team I'd probably say Bournemouth - particularly in the first half. They started off very well. They've now pushed Josh King as the centre-forward with Glenn Murray is now on the bench and you can see why they're doing it. He's [King] very clever, good in possession, little bit quicker than Murray - who's very good in the air. They started very well and sensed with this Swansea side are very delicate confidence-wise so they closed them down. They closed Britton, Shelvey and Ki and that's where it all happened. \"They played with one up front and Swansea have got one up front. There was only two minutes though when they held on to the 2-0 and Swansea were back in it.\" Player ratings Swansea: Fabianski (6), Naughton (6), Bartley (5), Williams (7), Taylor (6), Britton (5),

own goal Arsenal missed the chance to go top of the Premier League as West Brom came from behind to win 2-1 at the Hawthorns on Saturday. Olivier Giroud headed home Mesut Ozil's free kick to put the Gunners in front, but a James Morrison volley and a Mikel Arteta own goal turned things around in a five-minute spell before the break. Ozil hit the post in the second half but Arsenal - who lost Francis Coquelin and Arteta to knee and calf injuries respectively - couldn't find their way back into the game as Santi Cazorla missed a penalty late on. The result means Arsene Wenger's have not yet won in November in all competitions, as they turn their attention to the Champions League clash with Dinamo Zagreb in midweek. Olivier Giroud put Arsenal in front just before the half-hour mark Arsenal knew at least a draw would send them top of the league - for a few hours at least - and they started well, keeping possession despite not creating too many opportunities until Alexis Sanchez went close with a curling free kick from 25 yards, which was saved by Boaz Myhill. West Brom had a couple of chances from set pieces of their own, but the hosts struggled with poor deliveries, and eventually fell behind to an Arsenal free-kick in the 28th minute. Petr Cech felt luck went against Arsenal at the Hawthorns Petr Cech felt luck went against Arsenal at the Hawthorns Sanchez was brought down on the right and Ozil whipped it into the box, where Giroud was left unmarked to flick a header beyond Myhill and into the far corner. Arsenal's lead would only last seven minutes, though, as the Baggies won another free-kick and captain Chris Brunt's superb delivery was met by an equally brilliant volley from Morrison, who fired the ball straight into the top corner. James Morrison fired the hosts level with a fine finish Things went from bad to worse for the visitors as West Brom caught Ozil in possession before Rondon collected it in the Arsenal half. The striker found James McClean on the overlap, and the winger's cross was diverted into his own net by Arteta (40). Arsenal looked to find a way back quickly after the break and Ozil went close as the ball dropped for him 18 yards out, only for his low effort across goal to come back out off the upright. It was a frustrating afternoon for Alexis Sanchez and his team-mates Wenger threw on Joel Campbell as he looked to inject some life into his side just after the hour mark, but only a few minutes after coming on the Costa Rica international spurned a glorious opportunity. Cazorla clipped a delightful ball over the top which dropped for Campbell just a few yards out, but he could only slice well wide with the goal at his mercy. West Brom then nearly made him pay for the miss as Jonas Olsson powered Brunt's corner against the crossbar, but all the pressure was at the other end as Arsenal looked for an equaliser. Santi Cazorla slipped as he took the late penalty for Arsenal The Gunners' best chance came as Brunt was penalised for bundling over Sanchez in the box, but Cazorla slipped as he took the resulting spot-kick and ended up firing it way over the bar. It would prove costly for the visitors as they couldn't fashion another chance and West Brom held on to take victory. Matt Le Tissier analyses West Brom's 2-1 win over Arsenal Matt Le Tissier analyses West Brom's 2-1 win over Arsenal Matt Le Tissier's Soccer Saturday verdict \"It makes me think that perhaps the one thing that might stop Arsenal winning the title is their strength and depth. With the injuries that they've got, you look at what they put out there, you look at the bench to try and change the game and it wasn't a great deal. They brought Joel Campbell on for Kieran Gibbs and that was the only option they had in terms of attacking players.

The Reds boss sent out his side with a clear message to attack and they raced into a 3-0 lead inside 31 minutes with goals from Philippe Coutinho, Roberto Firmino and an Eliaquim Mangala own goal. A returning Sergio Aguero reduced the deficit before half-time but Liverpool, who missed a host of glorious opportunities, finally made the game safe with 10 minutes remaining thanks to a fantastic Martin Skrtel half-volley. Manuel Pellegrini claims it was a 'fake' performance from his Manchester City side Manuel Pellegrini claims it was a 'fake' performance from his Manchester City side Since taking over at Anfield, Klopp has now registered wins at Chelsea and City as Liverpool's high-energy game is providing excellent results on the road. Meanwhile, City, who could have gone top of the Premier League with a win, are in third, two points behind surprise leaders Leicester City. Jamie Redknapp and Frank Lampard highlight the performance of Philippe Coutinho Jamie Redknapp and Frank Lampard highlight the performance of Philippe Coutinho Aguero returned to the City side after missing the last seven games with a hamstring problem, but Liverpool had a plan to restrict City's star man by pressing high and to attack at every opportunity. The visitors set a brisk tempo and took the lead inside just seven minutes when Coutinho robbed Bacary Sagna of the ball in his own half and found Firmino in behind the pedestrian City back-line. Philippe Coutinho celebrates after putting Liverpool two up He rolled the ball across the six-yard box and Mangala epitomised his team's sluggish start by clumsily turning the ball into his own net. Buoyed by the goal, Liverpool continued to press. The Brazilian duo of Firmino and Coutinho were having a huge effect on the game and their bright play doubled the lead on 22 minutes. Firmino broke clear down the right-hand side and had the presence of mind to pick out his countryman with a glorious reverse pass. Coutinho, from eight yards, was in no mood to miss. Eliaquim Mangala turns the ball past Joe Hart and into his own net The home fans were now venting their frustration with their side's lacklustre tempo and it was soon 3-0. With 31 minutes on the clock, Emre Can produced an outrageous back-heel to find Coutinho down in space behind Sagna and he cut the ball across the six-yard box for Firmino to tap into an empty net. City needed a boost and their talisman Aguero stepped up just before half-time to give his side hope. After scoring for a fourth time for Liverpool against Manchester City, defender Martin Skrtel joked that he would like to play them every week After scoring for a fourth time for Liverpool against Manchester City, defender Martin Skrtel joked that he would like to play them every week The Argentine picked the ball up about 25 yards from goal, shifted the ball to his right and fired a wonderful shot into the far corner. Manuel Pellegrini's team had been out-thought, out-run and outclassed in the first period and he responded by bringing on Fernandinho and Fabian Delph for a very quiet Yaya Toure and Jesus Navas. In doing so, City tightened up the midfield and managed to restrict the space afforded to Coutinho but chances were at a premium for the hosts. Jurgen Klopp believes his Liverpool side have taken a 'big step' Jurgen Klopp believes his Liverpool side have taken a 'big step' Liverpool remained the team with more creativity in the final third and Can picked out Firmino on 60 minutes but Hart made a fantastic save with his right leg. City defender Mangala looked off the pace from the first-whistle and his performance never picked up. His sloppy pass on 60 minutes presented a chance for Firmino and Coutinho to break once again and although Coutinho rounded Hart and rolled the ball home, the linesman cut short the celebrations as he correctly flagged the Liverpool man offside. Raheem Sterling, facing Liverpool for the first time since leaving in the summer, cut a frustrated figure throughout but he nearly got his new team back into the match on 64 minutes. He latched onto an under-hit James Milner back-pass and squared the ball for Aguero but his shot from 15 yards was clawed away by Simon Mignolet. Raheem Sterling of Manchester City had a quiet game against his former club Liverpool weathered the pressure and the odds on a City comeback lengthened two minutes later when a tired-looking Aguero was replaced by Kelechi Iheanacho. With Klopp barking orders out from the touchline, Liverpool remained in control and wrapped up the points with 10 minutes remaining. A corner dropped at the feet of Skrtel and from about 18 yards he rocketed a half-volley past Hart into the top corner. Martin Skrtel scores for Liverpool with a rasping volley Liverpool have now scored as many goals in their last two away Premier League games (seven) as they managed in their 11 before that. The Klopp era appears up and running.

"Aston Villa forward Jordan Ayew battles with Nicolas Otamendi during Sunday's 0-0 draw Remi Garde saw his new Aston Villa side end a losing run by holding Premier League leaders Manchester City to a goalless draw at Villa Park on Sunday. The visitors will feel they did enough to win the game, with Kevin De Bruyne and Raheem Sterling both missing gilt-edged chances in the second half before Fernando rattled the bar with a header in stoppage-time. Manuel Pellegrini's side - who stay above Arsenal on goal difference - also believed they should have had a penalty in the first half when Sterling went down after contact from Ciaran Clark, only for referee Craig Pawson to allow play to continue. Manchester City defender Bacary Sagna (R) tackles Villa's Jordan Amavi But Garde - who watched defeat to Tottenham last time out from the stands - will be encouraged by a point that stops the rot after eight successive league defeats, although Villa remain bottom. The hosts started brightly and Jordan Amavi was heavily involved with a number of marauding runs from left-back, while Carles Gil drifted in from the right to decent effect. Remi Garde gave his thoughts following his first match in charge as Aston Villa manager Remi Garde gave his thoughts following his first match in charge as Aston Villa manager However, despite enjoying the majority of the possession in the first 15 minutes, Villa were unable to create any chances of note. At the other end, Aleksander Kolarov flashed a low ball across the box after a quick break from the visitors and as the half wore on, City began to gain the upper hand. City boss Manuel Pellegrini was frustrated with his side's missed chances against Villa City boss Manuel Pellegrini was frustrated with his side's missed chances against Villa Kolarov again got in down the left and tested Brad Guzan with a cross-shot before Fernando fired over after the ball dropped kindly to him from the resulting corner. Pellegrini introduced Jesus Navas midway through the half as Wilfried Bony limped off holding his hamstring, meaning De Bruyne was moved into a more advanced central position. It was the Belgian's clever flick to set City on the attack that should have led to the opening goal. Brad Guzan (R) catches the ball during the game at Villa Park Yaya Toure set Sterling away through the middle, but the former Liverpool man lacked confidence on his left foot and tumbled under Clark's attention after cutting in on his right instead, the referee waving away his claims for a penalty. Rudy Gestede provoked the Manchester City players with this ill-judged throw in which caught out Joe Hart Rudy Gestede provoked the Manchester City players with this ill-judged throw in which caught out Joe Hart City upped the pace after the break and began to lay siege to the Villa goal. Kolarov whipped in a free-kick that Guzan failed to hold but the 'keeper was fortunate to see the ball fall to a claret-and-blue shirt and cleared to safety. Moments later, Guzan came to his side's rescue when Navas floated in a perfect cross from the right to Sterling, who was waiting five yards out. Patrick Davison and Alan Smith look back and analyse Aston Villa's draw against Manchester City Patrick Davison and Alan Smith look back and analyse Aston Villa's draw against Manchester City The winger met it with a header but Guzan flung himself towards the ball and it caught him in the face before going out for a corner. The American may not have known much about it, but it was a vital stop. There was no let-up from City and Sterling saw another shot blocked from inside the area before De Bruyne miscued with the goal at his mercy. Navas was again the provider, this time with a cut-back from the byline, but De Bruyne succeeded only in clipping the ball off his own foot and out for a goal kick. Man of the match Micah Richards felt that the draw against City was 'massive' Man of the match Micah Richards felt that the draw against City was 'massive' The away side continued to press forwards but Villa's defence remained resolute and rebuffed their opponents time and again. The hosts could have snatched a breakaway winner twice during the final 15 minutes, only for the final ball to be lacking, firstly from Idrissa Gueye and then Leandro Bacuna, as they countered with numbers. The Villa faithful were roused again as Fabian Delph emerged from the bench for City, the former Villan's introduction met by a chorus of boos - and even some inflatable snakes. Some Aston Villa fans waved inflatable snakes as former player Fabian Delph came on as a City substitute It was City who ended the game going all out for the winner though and when Kelechi Iheanacho's cross was met by the head of Fernando, it looked as though they had found it. The ball rebounded off the bar though and Fernandinho's subsequent shot from the edge of the box slid just past the post as Villa held on to ensure a positive start for the new boss.

The home side did attempt to hit back but created only an offside chance for Alexis Sanchez before the break and Kane could have had another when he fired fiercely at Cech from a tight angle. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger praised his side's mental strength after he rang the changes at half-time Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger praised his side's mental strength after he rang the changes at half-time Hugo Lloris was forced into an excellent save to deny Campbell's curler towards the far corner just after the interval and Eriksen made Cech dive to beat away his effort moments later. But Arsenal began to smell danger from set pieces - a weakness for Spurs so far this season - and Olivier Giroud headed a free-kick against the crossbar before steering another header millimetres wide of the far post. Kieran Gibbs equalised for Arsenal at the far post on 77 minutes Cech kept the Gunners in the match by denying both Eriksen and Toby Alderweireld again, while Kane dragged a third good effort wide, but Spurs were finally punished for their failure to stop crosses 13 minutes from time. Gibbs got the better of Kyle Walker and poked an outstretched leg to steer the cross goalwards, and Lloris could not keep the ball out as he collided with the far post.

Goals in either half from Yannick Bolasie (21) and Scott Dann (82) sealed Alan Pardew's side all three points from this fixture for the second successive season, following their 3-1 triumph in the penultimate game of last term. Philippe Coutinho's 42nd-minute equaliser dragged Liverpool back into contention in an entertaining game on Merseyside, but the hosts were made to paid for their profligacy in front of goal, as well as a number of defensive errors. Crystal Palace's Scott Dann scored the winner against the club he supported as a boy, and says his side deserved the win Crystal Palace's Scott Dann scored the winner against the club he supported as a boy, and says his side deserved the win The result sees Palace climb to eighth in the Premier League table while Liverpool, whose 12-game unbeaten run in all competitions came to an end, drop a place to 10th. Palace travelled to Merseyside unbeaten in their last three league encounters with Liverpool and, with former Reds captain Steven Gerrard in attendance, they looked to continue from where they had left off on their last trip to Anfield, making a blistering start in rain-soaked conditions. Steven Gerrard was in attendance at Anfield with a watching brief Pardew's attacking formation looked to have the desired effect from the outset as Bolasie and Wilfried Zaha tormented a Liverpool rearguard which afforded their opponents the ball far too often in the final third. It was a series of defensive lapses that led to Palace's opener midway through the half. Alberto Moreno's feeble challenge allowed Bakary Sako to find Zaha on the right, before his cross was inexcusably cushioned into the path of Bolasie by Emre Can. Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp says his side were unlucky, having played well after a bad start Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp says his side were unlucky, having played well after a bad start The DR Congo international was then allowed to take a touch before turning and rifling the ball beyond Simon Mignolet in front of the Kop. Falling behind, however, kicked Liverpool into gear, with Palace limited to hitting the hosts on the break. Jurgen Klopp and Alan Pardew's first meeting passed with little incident Coutinho and Christian Benteke were quick to have efforts on goal as the hosts sought an instant response, but their attempts were either blocked or saved. Benteke then spurned a gilt-edged chance to restore parity on 32 minutes, striking Adam Lallana's low cross against his own leg instead of into the back of the net from close range. Alan Pardew believed Palace deserved the win at Anfield and praised the quality of the game Alan Pardew believed Palace deserved the win at Anfield and praised the quality of the game The travelling Palace support thought their side had doubled their advantage six minutes later when Sako turned the ball beyond Mignolet, but the offside flag came to Liverpool's rescue. After defender Mamadou Sakho was forced off by injury on 40 minutes, the Reds were soon level as Lallana's flick and Benteke's dummy of Nathaniel Clyne's cross set up Coutinho for the equaliser shortly before the interval. Philippe Coutinho celebrates his equaliser for Liverpool before half time The end-to-end nature of the first half continued into the second, with both sides exchanging blows in search of a second. Shortly after the hour mark, Sako's near-post drive nestled in the side-netting, before Benteke headed Moreno's cross over the bar at the other end with the goal gaping. Jordon Ibe was a constant threat on the counter to Palace Jason Puncheon's long-range drive on 73 minutes drew Mignolet into a fine save before Liverpool had claims for a penalty waved away after Lallana's goal-bound volley struck Dann in the area. And, with eight minutes to play, Dann earned his side the victory, capitalising on a defensive mismatch to out-muscle Roberto Firmino before heading home the rebound from his initial saved effort on goal.

In a game where the visitors had just two shots in the entire match, Bournemouth dominated from the first whistle to the last but were made to pay when Perez's shot - Newcastle's only effort on target - found the back of the net in the 27th minute. Eddie Howe's side continued to push forward in search of an equaliser but found Newcastle goalkeeper Rob Elliot, who shook off a thigh injury to take his place in the starting line-up, in inspired form as he produced save after save to help his side earn their first away win in 12 top-flight matches. Newcastle held on for a valuable three points to move up into 16th, while Bournemouth, who will be left wondering how they did not get anything from the game, replace the Magpies in the bottom three. Steve McClaren (left) and Eddie Howe greet prior to the match Bournemouth made two changes from the side which lost 2-0 at Southampton with Glenn Murray and Marc Pugh being replaced by Junior Stanislas and Josh King. And it was King who nearly gave the home side the perfect start, stinging the palms of Elliot with a fierce shot from just inside the penalty area in the fourth minute. Howe's men continued to attack and seven minutes later King was in the action again, nearly latching onto the ball after Chancel Mbemba's poor touch, only for quick-thinking Elliot to make another crucial intervention. Bournemouth were piling on the pressure and King was again denied by Elliot after using his pace to take the ball away from Fabricio Coloccini before firing a left-footed shot at goal. Cheick Tiote closes down Junior Stanislas during Newcastle's 1-0 win at Bournemouth It was another wasted opportunity and the home side were made to pay in the 27th minute when Perez raced on to a Georginio Wijnaldum flick before beating Adam Federici from the edge of the penalty area with his side's only shot of the half. Bournemouth responded well to going a goal down and could have been on level terms in the 35th minute but for another save from the inspired Elliot, who got down low to his right to push away King's glancing header from Matt Ritchie's free-kick. Adam Smith was next to go close for the hosts as his powerful drive clipped the top of the crossbar before Elliot made another superb save to keep out Dan Gosling's header from close range just before the break. It was much the same after the interval with Elliot at it again within 30 seconds of the restart, tipping over Ritchie's header from 12 yards. Rob Elliot made a number of saves during Newcastle's win at the Vitality Stadium Bournemouth were dominant but just could not find the back of the net as Harry Arter, Gosling and Stanislas all failing to hit the target with efforts. In the 64th minute, there were shouts for a penalty by Bournemouth fans as Andrew Surman went down under a challenge from Mbemba in the box in a similar incident to the one which saw Coloccino see red and give away a penalty against Sunderland two weeks ago. However, on this occasion Lee Mason saw nothing wrong with the challenge. Howe freshened things up with a double change with 17 minutes left on the clock as Lee Tomlin and Yann Kermorgant replaced King and Stanislas but the frustration continued for the home side as the game petered towards its conclusion. Six additional minutes rallied Bournemouth slightly and they created one final chance for Ritchie but Elliot made on final save as Newcastle clung on for a victory to boost their bid to ease away from the relegation zone.

A mistake from Heurelho Gomes gave N'Golo Kante the opener for Leicester He had only one effort in a goalless first half, firing tamely into Gomes' hands after Marc Albrighton had also gone close in an opening period arguably edged by the visitors. Watford had more possession and Odion Ighalo, the Hornet's top goalscorer this season, smacked a volley against the post after 20 minutes having been found in the box by Deeney. Jamie Vardy scored what proved to be the winner from he penalty spot on 65 minutes But Leicester have grown stronger in games week after week, and they deserved to go ahead seven minutes into the second half despite it being a gift from the 'keeper. Kante worked space inside the area and prodded a meager shot towards the far corner that should have been saved, but instead it crept in through Gomes's fingers. Quique Sanchez Flores says Watford's 2-1 defeat at Leicester was a very tight game Quique Sanchez Flores says Watford's 2-1 defeat at Leicester was a very tight game The Brazilian then launched himself at Vardy in the right-hand corner of the penalty area, sending the striker tumbling but avoiding a red card. Vardy smashed the spot-kick high into the net to make it 2-0 and the Foxes would have kept a clean sheet had it not been for a mistake from goalscorer Kante. NGolo Kante conceded the penalty for Watford's goal with a foul on Juan Carlos Peredes The summer signing lost possession inside his own area with a poor touch and then tripped his tackler Peredes. Deeney made no mistake but it proved in vain. Charlie Nicholas's Soccer Saturday verdict \"Leicester deserve to be where they are. When they get in front they keep driving forward, they don't sit back, and when they go behind they keep driving forward. \"Can anybody take anything away from them? In fairness it might have been a draw today but because they keep going for it and keep having goals and options in their play then you can take nothing away from them.\" Charlie Nicholas gives his view on Leicester's 2-1 win against Watford Charlie Nicholas gives his view on Leicester's 2-1 win against Watford Player ratings Leicester: Schmeichel (7), Simpson (7), Huth (7), Morgan (8), Fuchs (7), Albrighton (7), Kante (7), Drinkwater (7), Schlupp (7), Mahrez (7), Vardy (8).

United academy graduate Lingard struck superbly from 20 yards - his first senior goal for the club - to put the hosts 1-0 up seven minutes after the break following an uninspiring first half at Old Trafford. Saido Berahino missed a fine opportunity to equalise with 15 minutes remaining, heading over unmarked from six yards out, before Mata converted from the spot in injury-time after Anthony Martial had been brought down by Gareth McAuley, who was subsequently sent off. Louis van Gaal says Manchester United's 2-0 win against West Brom was a hard-fought one but he is thoroughly happy with the result Louis van Gaal says Manchester United's 2-0 win against West Brom was a hard-fought one but he is thoroughly happy with the result The result leaves United a point behind joint-leaders Manchester City, Arsenal and Leicester and is their eighth clean sheet out of 12 Premier League games this season. United named an unchanged side from the late 1-0 win over CSKA Moscow in midweek, but though they enjoyed 76 per cent of possession, a first-half performance without a goal failed to inspire the home support. Mata did come close to opening the scoring on 18 minutes, curling just wide from 15 yards on the right side of the area after Wayne Rooney's offload. Wayne Rooney (left) battles with former team-mate Johnny Evans in the first half Though West Brom's deep midfield and defence kept United at bay for the majority of the first half, the hosts had two opportunities to go one up heading into the break. First, Lingard saw his effort blocked well by former United defender Jonny Evans, before Martial forced Boaz Myhill into a save with a ferocious effort from just inside the box. But 20-year-old Lingard got his first goal in a United shirt after half-time in superb fashion, collecting Chris Brunt's headed clearance to side-foot the ball into the bottom corner from 20 yards past Myhill. Juan Mata (left) vies with Baggies midfielder Claudio Yacob West Brom's only clear chance of the game fell to substitute Berahino, who miscued his header over the bar from close range having been completely unmarked after Craig Dawson's weighted right-wing cross. As the visitors pushed for an equaliser in the closing stages, Martial broke upfield with the ball, only to be cynically brought down by McAuley, who was sent off by referee Mike Dean. Mata stepped up to slot the ball down the middle of Myhill's goal, sealing all three points for Louis van Gaal's side. West Brom manager Tony Pulis says his side worked extremely hard, despite their defeat West Brom manager Tony Pulis says his side worked extremely hard, despite their defeat Paul Merson's Soccer Saturday verdict \"The goal came out of absolutely nothing, they never really looked like scoring, Man United. Nothing happened in the first half, one shot by Martial that he should've put in the corner. \"Berahino comes on and he misses an absolute sitter, I saw him miss a chance at Watford earlier on in the season at the far post, it's worse than that. A great ball in by Dawson, six yards out and he goes to head it but he heads it over the bar.

Reaction from Jonny Howson, whose header ended a six-match winless run for Norwich as they beat Swansea 1-0 at Carrow Road Reaction from Jonny Howson, whose header ended a six-match winless run for Norwich as they beat Swansea 1-0 at Carrow Road Norwich were worthy winners despite Swansea having 67 per cent of the possession over the course of the 90 minutes; for all of their intelligent passing, the away side carried very little attacking threat. Mbokani's introduction changed the game and it was his powerful presence which provided the platform for Howson to score the game's only goal. Garry Monk says his Swansea side lacked a cutting edge in their 1-0 loss to Norwich Garry Monk says his Swansea side lacked a cutting edge in their 1-0 loss to Norwich Prior to that, the contest had followed a relentless pattern of Swansea possession and brief Norwich counter-attacks. Playing that way did not seem to suit the home side but they had the best goalscoring opportunity of the first half nine minutes into the game when Cameron Jerome, who would later make way for Mbokani, headed a Brady free-kick wide of the target. Howson is mobbed by his Norwich team-mates after netting what proved to be the winner The second half was a much more open affair and almost immediately after the restart, Howson provided a cross for Brady to force a good save from Lukasz Fabianski. Swansea's patient approach appeared as though it would pay off on 66 minutes when a low Wayne Routledge cross was diverted onto the top of the bar by Gylfi Sigurdsson.

Sam Allardyce says his Sunderland side are 'playing with fear' at present Sam Allardyce says his Sunderland side are 'playing with fear' at present Sunderland have now lost three of their four matches since Allardyce took over and remain in the relegation zone on just six points after 12 games. Meanwhile, Southampton are unbeaten in eight games in all competitions and have yet to taste defeat away from home in the Premier League this season. Tadic jumps for joy after netting his spot-kick Sunderland conceded six goals at Everton last weekend and Allardyce warned his players in midweek that they would need to improve defensively in order to yield more points. Allardyce handed young striker Duncan Watmore his first Premier League start in one of four changes to the team that were humbled on Merseyside.

Pantilimon was called into action 11 minutes later as Sadio Mane unleashed a snap-shot from 15 yards that needed punching clear. Sam Allardyce saw Sunderland lose again Sunderland needed more attacking inspiration after creating next to nothing in the first half and Allardyce sent on Fabio Borini at half-time in search for goals. However, it was the visitors that kept up the pressure. DeAndre Yedlin, on-loan from Tottenham, made a brave header on his goal line after Jose Fonte flicked a header towards the bottom corner following a Tadic corner. Adam Johnson (centre) battles with Jordy Clasie (left) and Steven Davis Sebastian Coates was the next Sunderland defender to make a goal saving block on 61 minutes when he got his right boot to a Steven Davis effort that had Pantilimon beaten. But it was M'Vila's costly error just after the hour mark which allowed the visitors the chance to go ahead. Ryan Bertrand says morale is high among the Southampton squad following their win at Sunderland Ryan Bertrand says morale is high among the Southampton squad following their win at Sunderland Bertrand made a scampering run down the left-hand side of the box and was brought down by M'Vila's clumsy challenge, prompting the referee to point to the spot. Tadic duly stepped up and whipped the ball into the far corner. Sunderland responded well, though, and Borini tested Maarten Stekelenburg with a powerful half-volley that on-loan Fulham goalkeeper tipped over the crossbar before Adam Johnson whipped a 25-yard free-kick just wide of the post. Tadic jumps for joy after netting his spot-kick Allardyce's men continued their forward momentum and had appeals for a penalty turned down late on when substitute Jack Rodwell's header hit Maya Yoshida on the arm, but their late charge was in vain. Phil Thompson's Soccer Saturday verdict \"Southampton really dominated this game from start to finish. They passed the ball better and there were moments they were trying to walk it in. Sunderland, when they lost the ball, backed off into their own half and tried to shuffle across trying to get close down. You were wondering if Southampton scored early it could have been anything but it didn't and they held out. \"Very few of the Sunderland players actually argued with the referee about the penalty decision.\" Player ratings Sunderland: Pantilimon (7), Jones (7), Kaboul (7), Coates (7), Yedlin (7), M'Vila (5), Gomez (5), Toivonen (6), Johnson (6), Watmore (6), Fletcher (5).

Romelu Lukaku gave his thoughts after scoring Everton's equaliser Romelu Lukaku gave his thoughts after scoring Everton's equaliser Neither side were able to find a winner after the break, with West Ham losing Dimitri Payet and his replacement Enner Valencia to injury.

West Ham manager Slaven Bilic felt his side gave away a 'cheap' equaliser West Ham manager Slaven Bilic felt his side gave away a 'cheap' equaliser West Ham had won just one of their last 18 encounters with Everton, with their last victory in the Premier League coming in 2007. Both sides made one change to their starting line-ups, with Winston Reid replacing the suspended James Collins for West Ham, and Brendan Galloway coming in for Bryan Oviedo for Everton. Manuel Lanzini celebrates his strike against Everton It was the hosts who created the first opportunity as Victor Moses shot into the side-netting from Payet's cut-back. Ross Barkley then curled an effort at Adrian at the other end before Arouna Kone shot wide after a quickly-taken free-kick. The Hammers looked most threatening down the right through Moses and it was from his blocked shot that the opening goal arrived after half an hour. Roberto Martinez was impressed by his Everton side's work-rate and also had positive words about referee Paul Tierney Roberto Martinez was impressed by his Everton side's work-rate and also had positive words about referee Paul Tierney The ball came out to Lanzini on the edge of the area and he showed fantastic composure to pick out the top corner with a fine right-footed shot. However, Lukaku got his obligatory goal against the Hammers two minutes before half-time. Deulofeu threaded the ball between two defenders and Lukaku took it around Adrian and rolled it into the net for his ninth goal of the campaign. Romelu Lukaku (left) challenges James Tomkins for the ball West Ham lost Payet to injury shortly after half-time, with the Frenchman feeling the effects of a scissor tackle from James McCarthy in the first half. Still, they went close to regaining the lead as Lanzini forced a fingertip save from Tim Howard at his near post and Reid headed over from a corner. The Hammers were forced into another change as Valencia was stretchered off and Lukaku almost won it for Everton late on when he prodded Galloway's low cross inches wide with four minutes remaining.

Manager Jose Mourinho was not at the Britannia Stadium due to his one-match stadium ban but his side's alarming slump continued, the visitors failing to make the most of a dominant first-half display as Arnautovic's spectacular effort (53) earned the Potters three points. The result leaves Chelsea - who have lost seven of their 12 league games - just three points above the relegation zone, and 13 points adrift of the top-four places, while Stoke, who also knocked the Blues out of the Capital One Cup a fortnight ago, climb to 12th in the Premier League table. Chelsea goalkeeper Asmir Begovic says that the squad are all behind manager Jose Mourinho, despite the club's poor start to the season Chelsea goalkeeper Asmir Begovic says that the squad are all behind manager Jose Mourinho, despite the club's poor start to the season Mourinho had given his pre-match talk in the team hotel but his presence remained as fans donned masks and held aloft cardboard cut-outs of their beleaguered manager. An unchanged Potters side sought to unsettle the Blues, Xherdan Shaqiri's overhead kick in the opening minute an early signal of intent. But the hosts failed to build off the promising start, and with Erik Pieters off the pitch receiving treatment for nasty-looking blow to his nose, the visitors looked to make the most of their momentary advantage. Jamie Redknapp believes Loic Remy was 'too honest' after hurdling a challenge in the penalty area by Stoke goalkeeper Jack Butland Jamie Redknapp believes Loic Remy was 'too honest' after hurdling a challenge in the penalty area by Stoke goalkeeper Jack Butland First Eden Hazard and Willian combined to set up Ramires on 14 minutes, but his toe-poked effort went wide, before Diego Costa came within inches of turning Cesar Azpilicueta's cross home a minute later. The action kept coming as Stoke created their first clear opening. Glen Johnson's foray up field saw him force Asmir Begovic into a decent save low to his right, before Azpilicueta hacked the ball to safety. Jack Butland, instrumental to the Potters' goalless draw at Newcastle last weekend, looked on top form again, denying Ramires' looping volley with a fine save shortly after. Speaking after Chelsea's seventh league defeat of the season, to Stoke, Jamie Redknapp questioned Jose Mourinho's behaviour this season Speaking after Chelsea's seventh league defeat of the season, to Stoke, Jamie Redknapp questioned Jose Mourinho's behaviour this season Shaqiri was a constant threat in the first half, giving Chelsea left-back Baba Rahman a torrid time and the Swiss international almost turned provider for Jon Walters on 28 minutes, but the Irishman, who signed a new two-and-a-half year deal at Stoke ahead of kick-off, headed his cross over. Chelsea mounted a late push for the breakthrough but Butland was on hand again to keep parity, denying Costa with his feet five minutes before the interval. Mark Hughes's half-time team-talk appeared to have the desired effect as an improved Stoke began the second period the stronger of the two sides. And within eight minutes they had they finally broken Chelsea's resolve. Chelsea fans arrive at Stoke sporting Jose Mourinho masks Bojan Krkic's inch-perfect pass played Glen Johnson in behind Rahman. He delivered a great ball into the area where, after Walters had failed to turn the ball goal wards, Arnautovic was on hand to volley the ball beyond Begovic. Chelsea looked for an instant response but were limited to long-range efforts until Pedro's curling strike on 67 minutes beat Butland but struck the post. The introduction of Oscar, Cesc Fabregas and then Loic Remy saw the visitors push for a route back into the game, and they had grounds for a penalty five minutes from time as Remy saw a good chance go to waste after he was forced to hurdle the on-rushing Butland. Ramires' shot forced Butland into a decent save in the first half. Walters and Arnautovic had chances to wrap up the three points but, in the end, there was no need as the result condemned Chelsea to their seventh defeat of the season, the first time Mourinho has tasted seven league defeats in one season in his managerial career.

In between, there was a deflected Kane shot which Guzan tipped over and a short-corner routine that saw Danny Rose sweep just over the top, while Ashley Westwood took a loose Dembele forearm in the face and had to be replaced by Ayew. Dele Alli scores Spurs' second as he volleys through a crowd of Villa defenders Kevin MacDonald, in the Villa dugout as caretaker, made further proactive changes in pursuit of a comeback - eventually with some success, as Gestede forced Jan Vertonghen into a desperate block and the same Spurs defender then unwittingly sent Ayew's low shot beyond a wrong-footed Lloris. Leandro Bacuna had hit the base of a post moments before Ayew's goal, and there were chances for an equaliser as Gestede headed wide having outjumped Lloris and Ayew cleared the crossbar by inches from distance. It did not come, and Kane made the game safe with a first-time finish high to Guzan's left.

Despite Sunderland hitting the post twice in the opening 20 minutes, Everton took the lead against the run of play in the 19th minute with the excellent Gerard Deulofeu sliding the ball under Costel Pantilimon. Kone doubled his side's advantage 12 minutes later but Sunderland got back into the game with goals from Jermain Defoe and Steven Fletcher either side of the half-time interval. The momentum seemed to have swung in favour of the visitors but Everton had other ideas as Sebastian Coates' own goal sparked a burst three goals in eight minutes for the home side. Romelu Lukaku added his side's fourth in the 60th minute before Kone scored the fifth just three minutes later and he was celebrating again 14 minutes from time as he completed his treble. Arouna Kone celebrates after he scores their sixth goal and completes his hat trick The win moves Everton, who scored six for the first time since their 7-1 win over Sunderland back in November 2007, up to eighth in the Premier League, while Sam Allardyce's side stay in the bottom three. Allardyce has not enjoyed a good a record against Everton, losing his last six Premier League matches against Roberto Martinez's side but it was the visitors who made the better start. Arouna Kone was proud of his first Premier League hat-trick which helped Everton to a 6-2 win over Sunderland Arouna Kone was proud of his first Premier League hat-trick which helped Everton to a 6-2 win over Sunderland Sunderland threatened in just the third minute as Patrick van Aanholt's powerful shot beat Tim Howard but crashed back off the post. Goodison Park rose as one in the fourth minute to mark the passing of Everton legend Howard Kendall and it spurred Martinez's men into action as first Lukaku and then Ross Barkley had shots from distance. Romelu Lukaku makes it 4-2 to Everton Allardyce's side came close to opening the scoring with Adam Johnson striking the same post Van Aanholt hit after Howard blocked Defoe's effort, but Everton found the breakthrough on 19 minutes. Kone flicked the ball into the path of Deulofeu and he raced through on goal. The Spaniard composed himself before passing the ball under Pantilimon and into the back of the net. Roberto Martinez says his Everton players were rewarded for their ruthless streak in the final third Roberto Martinez says his Everton players were rewarded for their ruthless streak in the final third Everton doubled their advantage in the 31st minute and Kone was involved again, producing an excellent finish into the roof of the net after a one-two with Lukaku. Everton were cruising towards half-time but out of nothing Sunderland were handed a lifeline in stoppage time when Defoe beat John Stones to Coates' hopeful long ball before lifting the ball over Ramiro Funes Mori and rifling the ball past Howard. The goal gave Allardyce plenty to work with at the break and Sunderland, who came out with renewed energy, were back on level terms minutes into the second half when Fletcher rose above Funes Mori to head the ball into the back of the net. Jermain Defoe pulls one back for Sunderland deep into first-half injury-time It was Sunderland who seemed to be on the front foot now but it was the quality of Everton and Deulofeu in particular that shone through as the Spaniard's testing cross was turned into his own net by former Liverpool defender Coates. Deulofeu was involved again five minutes later as his perfect through ball found Lukaku, who rounded Pantilimon to restore his side's two-goal cushion. Sam Allardyce says Sunderland paid the price for trying to win the game in the second half at Goodison Park Sam Allardyce says Sunderland paid the price for trying to win the game in the second half at Goodison Park Kone added a fifth just minutes later after good work from James McCarthy and the striker, who is out of contract at the end of the season, then completed his hat-trick by heading home Lukaku's cross as Sunderland fell apart. The win is a welcome return to form for Martinez's side in the league but for Sunderland the heavy defeat is a reminder of the challenge facing Allardyce as he bids to steer them away from relegation.

The Saints took the bragging rights in the south-coast clash thanks to first-half goals in quick succession from Steven Davis and Graziano Pelle. And despite having midfielder Victor Wanyama sent off with 12 minutes left to play, the home side held on to move up to seventh in the table after just one defeat in their last nine league contests. Southampton boss Ronald Koeman reverted to the same team that started last Sunday's impressive 1-1 draw at Liverpool after their midweek Capital One Cup win against Aston Villa, meaning influential midfielder Saido Mane was back from suspension. The visitors, though, were without goalkeeper Artur Boruc with a thigh problem, although that loss was offset by midfielder Harry Arter's return from injury for his first-ever Premier League start. And Southampton started like a team who had never lost at home to their opponents in any competition, with the Saints dominating possession right from the kick-off, without ever truly testing back-up Bournemouth 'keeper Adam Federici though in the opening quarter of the game. Steven Davis celebrates with Cedric Soares after putting Southampton 1-0 up against Bournemouth at St Mary's The lively Mane had one goalbound effort deflected just off target, after being set up by a brilliant knockdown by Pelle, while Southampton also had appeals for a penalty when Jordy Clasie's well-struck shot hit the hand of a Bournemouth player, only for referee Craig Pawson to deem it accidental. However, the home side's grievances were short lived as minutes later they were deservedly ahead after a lovely move down their left flank involving the impressive Clasie and Pelle, before the latter's delicate touch released the overlapping Ryan Bertrand, and the left-back's inch-perfect centre then picked out the unmarked Davis to score from close range. Graziano Pelle felt Southampton need to improve on their second half performance but added the team defended well under pressure Graziano Pelle felt Southampton need to improve on their second half performance but added the team defended well under pressure And before the visitors could clear their heads, they soon found themselves two behind after another excellent Southampton move down their left wing, this time involving Dusan Tadic, with his inviting cross being powered home by Pelle's head from six yards out, the Italy international's ninth goal in all competitions this season. Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe needed a response from his players in what little time they had before the break, and he very nearly got it when the previously invisible Glenn Murray broke clear of the Saints back line. But just as the striker prepared to shoot, covering Southampton defender Virgil van Dijk got back to make a brilliant goal-saving block, before the rebound was headed just wide by Dan Gosling. Victor Wanyama was shown a red card 12 minutes from time Howe responded at half-time by making a double substitution, taking off Murray - who made just one pass in the whole of the first half - and Marc Pugh, and bringing on Junior Stanislas and Josh King. And the changes had the desired impact as the visitors dominated the second period in terms of both possession, territory and chances, without ever being able to get that crucial first goal. Eddie Howe says his Bournemouth side were punished for underperforming in the first half at St Mary's Eddie Howe says his Bournemouth side were punished for underperforming in the first half at St Mary's Southampton, meanwhile, were quite content to sit back, soak up the pressure and protect their 2-0 lead, a tactic that almost backfired when Wanyama picked up a second yellow card after a lunging tackle on Bournemouth substitute Lee Tomlin, an indiscretion that will see the Kenyan miss next weekend's game against Sunderland. But with not enough time to take advantage of their numerical superiority - the closest Bournemouth came to scoring coming in injury time when Maarten Stekelenburg was forced to beat away Tomlin's shot at his near post - Southampton were able to hold on to make it five top-flight games now without defeat.

Despite their forward pressing, chances were at a premium until 28 minutes when Adam Lallana had an opportunity to turn in a James Milner cross from about 10 yards out but it was straight at Asmir Begovic. Chelsea huffed and puffed but apart from flashy bursts forward by Willian they looked toothless in attacking areas with Eden Hazard and Diego Costa maintaining their underwhelming form. Ramires (right) celebrates scoring the opening goal for Chelsea against Liverpool in the fourth minute at Stamford Bridge With half-time approaching, Liverpool drew level. The visitors worked the ball to Coutinho on the edge of the box and he danced inside before curling a fantastic effort into the far corner. Klopp celebrated while Mourinho stormed straight down the tunnel. Klopp's arrival at Anfield has spiced up events in the technical area and he engaged in some fiery dialogue with a member of the Chelsea backroom staff, who was sitting in the stands, after Willian was fouled by the dugout on 57 minutes. Mourinho remained in his seat for that episode but sprung into life on 68 minutes when Lucas, who was already on a booking, committed a foul on Ramires in the middle of the pitch. The Chelsea players surrounded the referee calling for a second yellow and Mourinho fumed on the sidelines but referee Mark Clattenburg waved away the protests. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho (centre) watches from the sidelines Oscar nearly caught a back-pedalling Simon Mignolet out from 40 yards but just five minutes later Chelsea's season hit a new low as Coutinho grabbed his second. The Brazilian wriggled into space in the penalty area and his shot deflected off John Terry past the despairing dive of Begovic. With Stamford Bridge stunned and chants of \"you're getting sacked in the morning\" emanating from the away end towards Mourinho, Liverpool got their third on 83 minutes. Benteke picked the ball up in the box, found a half yard of space and picked his spot to find the far corner. Chelsea and Mourinho had no response.

It was the Eagles who created the better chances in a tight contest at Selhurst Park, with Yannick Bolasie hitting the bar after 11 minutes. Yohan Cabaye volleyed wide from close range in the second half before Scott Dann headed just past the post from a corner. David de Gea also saved from Dwight Gayle, while United offered little attacking threat at the other end. The goalless draw is United's third in succession after being held by Manchester City last weekend and then failing to score in 120 minutes against Middlesbrough in the Capital One Cup in midweek. And yet again they lacked a cutting edge up front, with Palace creating almost all the opportunities on goal. Louis van Gaal, who on Friday deflected criticism that his side were boring, made two changes from the derby draw with City as Matteo Darmian and Daley Blind started in place of Ashley Young and Phil Jones. Wilfried Zaha and Dwight Gayle were among four players brought into the starting XI by Alan Pardew, whose side made the far brighter start. Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal says he could not complain with a draw at Selhurst Park. Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal says he could not complain with a draw at Selhurst Park. Pressing United high up the pitch, they forced an early misplaced pass from Darmian before Bolasie's shot was tipped onto the bar by De Gea after 11 minutes. The United keeper then kept out a header from Scott Dann as Palace looked to press home their advantage. But United weathered the early storm without any damage and then started to dominate possession. Chances were proving hard to create, though, with Wayne Hennessey coming out quickly to prevent Wayne Rooney getting onto Anthony Martial's pass. Wayne Rooney complains to referee Mike Jones Dwight Gayle then missed an opportunity at the other end after clever chest control from Cabaye, before Ander Herrera miscued a shot from Martial's cut-back. Palace had lost their previous three matches and never beaten United in the Premier League, but they played with more purpose than the visitors after the break. Zaha and Bolasie looked the most threatening players on the pitch but it was from Joel Ward's cross that Cabaye should have put Palace ahead after 70 minutes, but instead he volleyed wide. Crystal Palace boss Alan Pardew praised his side's excellent performance. Crystal Palace boss Alan Pardew praised his side's excellent performance. Dann then went close with a header from a corner before De Gea kept out a shot from Gayle with his legs. Van Gaal had thrown on Marouane Fellaini and Young in place of Darmian and Bastian Schweinsteiger but still the visitors struggled to create chances. The closest they came was when another substitute, Jesse Lingard, cut back for Martial, whose shot was blocked by Damien Delaney. Delaney then failed to get a clean contact on a header at the other end as the game finished goalless. Soccer Saturday verdict - Charlie Nicholas \"Manchester United were slightly fortunate to get the 0-0. They had a little period towards the end of the first half where they created a couple of bits and pieces, but nothing exciting. \"I watched the subs coming on and they even looked miserable. Everything is hard work and they have this routine where Rooney starts and he tries to feed himself into the game. He gets very little to work off. Louis van Gaal saw his side fail to score for the third successive game \"We know Martial has pace and the talent but he's stuck out on the left and it's like they refuse to budge from the set up. I don't think Louis van Gaal is restricting them that much. \"United are still up there battling away but this is not the Manchester United that we all enjoy.\" Player ratings Crystal Palace: Hennessey (6), Kelly (5), Dann (6), Delaney (6), Ward (6), McArthur (6), Cabaye (6), Zaha (7), Puncheon (6), Bolasie (7), Gayle (5).

Nicolas Otamendi opened the scoring for City in the 67th minute, before Hart's error allowed Cameron Jerome to tap home with seven minutes to play. But there was late drama as Manchester City were awarded a penalty and Norwich captain Russell Martin sent off for handball and the denial of a goal-scoring opportunity in the 88th minute. That gave Toure the chance from the spot, and the Ivory Coast international made it nine successful penalties out of nine in the Premier League to put City ahead. Yaya Toure celebrates his winner from the penalty spot. Manuel Pellegrini side's still had time to win, and miss, another penalty as Aleksandar Kolarov fired wide following Robbie Brady's trip on Raheem Sterling in the last minute of stoppage time. The victory keeps Manchester City top of the table with 25 points from 11 games ahead of a trip to Sevilla in the Champions League next week, and the league leaders have now scored 22 goals from their last seven games. As for Norwich, the defeat makes it four straight in the Premier League, and they remain winless in the top flight since their 3-1 victory over Bournemouth in mid-September. Norwich's goalscorer Cameron Jerome says he's disappointed with his side's 2-1 loss at Man City. Norwich's goalscorer Cameron Jerome says he's disappointed with his side's 2-1 loss at Man City. Alex Neil sprang a surprise with his tactics from the start, choosing to operate a back three of Martin, Sebastien Bassong and Ryan Bennett, with Brady and Martin Olsson as wing-backs, and the system worked well. Having lost 7-0 on their previous visit to the Etihad Stadium, the plan was to keep it tight, and Manchester City were left frustrated by a disciplined Norwich display in a first-half that yielded just two clear cut chances - one to either side. Bony miscued badly when set through by strike partner Kelechi Iheanacho, who was making his first Premier League start, while Matt Jarvis forced an excellent save from Hart after a quick counter-attack from the Canaries. Cameron Jerome occupied Vincent Kompany and Otamendi as Norwich retained a threat on the break even while ceding possession, and Alexander Tettey and Youssouf Mulumbu did an effective job screening Kevin de Bruyne. Cameron Jerome battles with Nicolas Otamendi. Bony twice fired wide of John Ruddy's left hand post, with his first chance a golden opportunity to break the deadlock 20 minutes in. Iheanacho nut-megged Martin in the build-up, and fed Bony, who cut inside onto his right foot before blazing wide. A mazy run from Brady down the right-hand side led to Norwich's best opening - Jarvis latched on to the Ireland international's through ball and took it first time after splitting Kompany and Bacary Sagna, but Hart tipped over. Manchester City's Nicolas Otamendi put City 1-0 up against Norwich with his first goal for the club. The game remained finely poised until Otamendi, La Liga's top scoring defender in his final season at Valencia, gave City the lead with a fantastic header mid-way through the second half. Nicolas Otamendi scored his first goal for Manchester City in their 2-1 win over Norwich. Nicolas Otamendi scored his first goal for Manchester City in their 2-1 win over Norwich. Having defended so well, Norwich went to sleep from a corner and allowed the Argentina international to power past Ruddy from 12 yards. The Canaries had grown in confidence prior to Otamendi's opener, and equalised on 84 minutes after a calamitous mistake from Hart. The England international misjudged Brady's deep cross, and dropped the ball at the feet of Jerome, leaving the Norwich striker the simplest of chances to level the score. Man City manager Manuel Pellegrini says he's not concerned with Joe Hart after the goalkeepers clanger gifted Norwich's Cameron Jerome an equaliser. Man City manager Manuel Pellegrini says he's not concerned with Joe Hart after the goalkeepers clanger gifted Norwich's Cameron Jerome an equaliser. But the Premier League leaders struck back six minutes later, capitalising on a Ruddy error to make it three straight Premier League wins. The Norwich keeper was left stranded after rushing out to clear his lines, and Fernando shifted the ball to Sterling, who swept towards an empty net, only for Martin to intervene with his elbow with the goal gaping. Referee Bobby Madley pointed to the spot and sent off the Canaries skipper, who left the field with no complaint, allowing Toure to put City back in front with just injury time to play. Olsson's deflected strike tested Hart in the final minutes of stoppage time as the Canaries pushed for a leveller, before a City break ended with Sterling winning a penalty following a foul by Brady. But Kolarov, who stepped up after regular taker Toure was substituted late on, missed the target with the final kick of the game. City travel to Spain in mid-week, before they return to Premier League action away to Aston Villa next Sunday, while Norwich will look to end their poor run of form when they welcome Swansea City to Carrow Road. Soccer Saturday Verdict - Paul Merson It took a late penalty from Yaya Toure for Manchester City to remain at the top of the Premier League despite a courageous display from Norwich City. It took a late penalty from Yaya Toure for Manchester City to remain at the top of the Premier League despite a courageous display from Norwich City. In the first 15 minutes they came out and dominated the game. They pushed Norwich back and Wilfried Bony missed a really good chance and lashed it wide. Then they went off the boil and the longer the first half went on Norwich are in confidence and all of a sudden Matt Jarvis had a shot on the run which forced a good save from Joe Hart. They came out for the second half and it was all Norwich. If they had a little bit more about them in the final third they could have scored a couple of goals. But City got a corner and what a header! I don't think you will see a better header this season than the one from Nicolas Otamendi, who was outstanding. After that I thought it was all over but out of nothing Hart just dropped Robbie Brady's floated cross and there's Cameron Jerome, who just tapped it in. What a mistake it could have been. It looked like they had got a 1-1 draw out of nothing but Toure scored the penalty to make it 2-1.

The England goalkeeper proved to be the difference on Tyneside, preserving parity on several occasions with a host of exceptional saves as Newcastle pushed for what would have been a deserved breakthrough. Aleksandar Mitrovic's header was the closest either side came to scoring in an uneventful first half, but his effort struck the post having evaded the reach of Butland. Jon Walters came closest to scoring for the visitors, with Rob Elliot producing a similarly spectacular save to deny the Republic of Ireland international after the break. The result sees Newcastle momentarily leapfrog Sunderland, who play against Everton on Sunday, into 18th position, while Stoke draw level with Swansea on 13 points. With three of the Premier League's bottom four playing after the Magpies, Saturday's game provided Steve McClaren's side with the perfect opportunity to bounce back from last weekend's Wear-Tyne derby defeat, with a victory moving them out of the Premier League relegation zone. Daryl Janmaat and Marko Arnautovic tangle Yet, after a pulsating opening minute, the hosts could have conceded a penalty when Paul Dummett appeared to clip Bojan on six minutes, but referee Roger East was unmoved. Stoke created the game's first clear opening on 17 minutes. Charlie Adam's deliciously whipped cross evaded Chancel Mbemba's desperate attempted clearance, seconds before Walters failed to turn the ball home from close range. Mitrovic then thought he had opened the scoring when he guided Moussa Sissoko's cross from the left towards goal on 28 minutes. But a combination of woodwork, to deny Mitrovic, and Butland, to deny Georginio Wijnaldum from converting the rebound, kept the score level. Newcastle then had penalty claims of their own turned down on 37 minutes when Ayoze Perez went to ground after losing possession, but again the referee waved the claims away. Steve McLaren was full of praise for Jack Butland and felt he was the difference between Newcastle winning against Stoke. Steve McLaren was full of praise for Jack Butland and felt he was the difference between Newcastle winning against Stoke. Perez's early sighter after half-time failed to draw Butland into action but the Stoke stopper was soon involved, single-handedly denying a string of fine Newcastle efforts. Wijnaldium's dipping free-kick was tipped away on 50 minutes, while Butland's opposite number, Elliot, was on hand to deny Walters with a point-blank save. Butland was soon back in the spotlight, rushing off his line to deny Sissoko, after the Frenchman played a neat one-two with Wijnaldum. Mbemba failed to even test Butland on 56 minutes, missing a gilt-edged close-range header before the Stoke keeper palmed Perez's forceful drive away. Mitrovic and Philipp Wollschied then clashed, with the former falling to the ground theatrically after a coming together. Again, referee East dealt with the situation well, issuing both players with yellow cards. Butland then capped off his Man of the Match performance with two exquisite saves at the death, first to deny Sissoko's thunderbolt before tipping substitute Jamaal Lascelles' header over. Soccer Saturday verdict - Matt le Tissier \"Jack Butland was the difference in this game. Newcastle will be looking at this game and thinking that's two points that have got away. \"Stoke didn't really create too many chances. Rob Elliot only had to make one save I can remember and that was from a Jonathan Walters header. \"Butland made four or five really good saves and on the balance of play Newcastle probably deserved all three points.\" Mark Hughes was frustrated with the goalless draw to Newcastle and was thankful for Jack Butland in goal.

The Gunners were second-best in the first period but had a couple of narrow escapes and then took the lead through Oliver Giroud just after half-time. And the decisive moment of the match came in the 68th minute when Laurent Koscielny turned the ball into a gaping net and the goal was allowed to stand, although the Swansea players were convinced goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski had been fouled. Joel Campbell then capped a great day for Arsenal four minutes later, lashing the ball into the net to score his first goal for the club, on the day he made his first Premier League start. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Theo Walcott were unavailable to the visitors after picking up injuries in midweek, joining a lengthy list of absentees which may hinder the Gunners in the weeks ahead. And a 3-0 away win looked an unlikely scenario in the first-half as Arsenal struggled to contain a lively Swansea side who did the double over them last season. Bafetimbi Gomis could have given Swansea the lead but he was denied by an excellent Hector Bellerin tackle The Swans should have taken the lead just after the 20-minute mark when Jonjo Shelvey's fine pass put Bafetimbi Gomis clean through on goal. However, the forward is struggling for goals at the moment and delayed his shot too long, taking the time to go round Petr Cech but giving Hector Bellerin time to get back and produce a brilliant goal-saving tackle. With Jefferson Montero a constant threat down the left, the Swans continued to press and they had a strong case for a penalty when the winger won a free-kick on the edge of the box and Per Mertesacker appeared to block Gylfi Sigurdsson's shot with his arm, unseen by the officials. Arsene Wenger was happy with Arsenal’s second-half performance. Arsene Wenger was happy with Arsenal’s second-half performance. Arsenal created one decent first-half opportunity but Giroud put his first-time shot over the crossbar after he had been played in by Alexis Sanchez. However, the French forward made no mistake two minutes into the second-half, eluding his marker Ashley Williams at a Mesut Ozil corner in expert fashion and then nodding the ball into the net from close range to score Arsenal's 2,000th goal under Arsene Wenger's management. Laurent Koscielny scored Arsenal's second but Swansea felt Lukasz Fabianski was fouled beforehand Swansea were far from dispirited by the setback and stormed forward with renewed hunger, Sigurdsson drawing a great save from Cech with a piledriver from the edge of the box. And Bellerin then produced an incredible block to deny Andre Ayew, the fact the flag had gone up for offside not detracting from the defender's bravery, as he crashed into a post in order to keep the ball out. The Swans then had the stuffing knocked out them by a bizarre second goal, which came when Ozil crossed and the ball looped into the air off Williams, allowing Giroud and Koscielny to challenge Fabianski. The former Arsenal man dropped the ball under pressure but no free-kick was given and Koscielny was able to tap the ball into the net and double the visitors' advantage. Garry Monk was disappointed with 'gifting' Arsenal two goals. Garry Monk was disappointed with 'gifting' Arsenal two goals. A third goal soon followed and it was far more typical of the Gunners, Ozil exchanging passes neatly with Sanchez and then sending over a low cross from the left which Campbell finished off superbly at the back post, taking a touch before drilling the ball emphatically into the far corner. Swansea remained defiant and Williams drew another good save from Cech, but the game was now set up perfectly for Arsenal and it was somewhat surprising that they did not add further goals as they charged forward on the break in the closing stages. However, three were more than enough for the travelling contingent, as what had looked like being a really tough afternoon turned into a comfortable win, and three vital points which keep the Londoners in the thick of the title race. Soccer Saturday Verdict - Phil Thompson \"Arsenal were very poor in the first half by their own standards. Their passing was sloppy and the concentration from the players was not there. \"At half-time they were probably happy to go in at 0-0, because they got away with a penalty decision when Gylfi Sigurdsson's free-kick hit Per Mertesacker's arm. \"Bafetembi Gomis has a wonderful opportunity. What a ball by Jonjo Shelvey to split the defence and Gomis is away. He has a clear run through but Petr Cech stays big and strong and forces him away from goal. \"At the time I thought Swansea could rue that chance and that's exactly what happened.\" Player ratings

celebrate after Odion Ighalo (obscured) gave the Hornets a 1-0 advantage against West Ham Odion Ighalo scored either side of half-time as Watford broke into the Premier League top 10 with a 2-0 win over West Ham. The hosts were worthy winners and although Ighalo's first goal owed a debt of gratitude to a critical touch from Hammers defender Aaron Cresswell, his second was an excellent strike which ended the game as a contest early in the second half. To add to West Ham's troubles, they had centre-back James Collins sent off five minutes from time for a clumsy challenge on Ighalo. Watford are now ninth in the Premier League as a result, while their opponents have slipped to fifth courtesy of Manchester United's draw at Crystal Palace. Ighalo will claim the first goal although his foot appeared to make a connection with the ball a fraction of a second before Cresswell's did.

West Ham manager Slaven Bilic says his side were beaten fair and square by Watford as they lost 2-0 at Vicarage Road due to two defensive errors. The chance itself came about after a poor mistake by Andy Carroll, who failed to clear inside his own box and was dispossessed on the touchline by Nathan Aké, whose pass across goal arrived at the feet of Ighalo via a deflection off goalkeeper Adrian. Although it was a fortuitous way to take the lead, Watford deserved it, having had almost all of the attacking play in the game up to that point as West Ham played liked a shadow of the side which has won this season at Arsenal and Manchester City. Troy Deeney had a shot blocked close to the goalline by what looked suspiciously like Carroll's hand on 10 minutes and the striker twice caused problems at corners. Head coach Quique Flores was pleased with his Watford side Head coach Quique Flores was pleased with his Watford side The Nigerian striker forced Adrian into a good save after the referee played a good advantage following a foul on Deeney and then produced some superb skill down the left week before crossing to Almen Abdi, who scuffed his effort straight at Adrian. The goalkeeper did not get close to Watford and Ighalo's second goal, a fine left-footed strike after James Tomkins had failed to deal with Ikechi Anya's low cross from the left wing. Watford's Odion Ighalo celebrates scoring his team's second goal With a two-goal lead and West Ham in poor form, the home side were able to complete the match in a counter-attacking system, allowing their opponents to have the ball for long spells as they patiently waited for gaps to exploit.

The home side took the lead through Salomon Rondon's header on the half-hour mark, but Riyad Mahrez struck twice after half-time, the second from an offside position, to turn the game on its head. Vardy then joined Ruud van Nistelrooy and Daniel Sturridge in netting in his eighth straight game before substitute Rickie Lambert pulled one back for the Baggies with a late penalty. West Brom boss Tony Pulis would have every right to feel aggrieved, though, as his side were also denied two strong penalty claims during the game by referee Anthony Taylor. Leicester started by far the better of the two sides, and it was the in-form Vardy who nearly broke the deadlock in the opening minutes. West Brom's Salomon Rondon beats Kasper Schmeichel to put the Baggies 1-0 up The striker turned Jonny Evans inside and out before hitting a low effort that appeared to be heading in at the near post, but West Brom goalkeeper Boaz Myhill just about got down in time to touch it onto the woodwork. Before today, all eight of West Brom's Premier League goals this season had come in either the 15 minutes before half-time or the 15 minutes after the break (four in each period), and Rondon's opener was just seconds out from continuing that record, as he powered home a header at the near post from Stephane Sessegnon's corner just before the clock hit 30 minutes. West Brom had the momentum and felt they should have had a penalty when Evans had his shirt pulled in the box by Leicester striker Leonardo Ulloa - but referee Taylor wasn't interested. Jamie Vardy praised the character of his side after he scored for the eighth Premier League game in a row. Jamie Vardy praised the character of his side after he scored for the eighth Premier League game in a row. Then, just before the hour-mark, Leicester found the equaliser through Mahrez, who got onto the end of a superb Marc Albrighton cross before stroking it past Myhill. Moments later the Baggies were calling for a penalty again after captain Darren Fletcher was cleaned out by Robert Huth inside the box. Again, though, it was waved away by Taylor, and just three minutes later the Foxes were in front in controversial circumstances. Jamie Vardy praised the character of his side after he scored for the eighth Premier League game in a row. Jamie Vardy praised the character of his side after he scored for the eighth Premier League game in a row. It was the combination of Albrighton and Mahrez again who conjured it, but this time the Algerian was clearly offside as he got onto the end of the ball in before firing home. Then, with West Brom still furious, Vardy raced through onto a pass by Danny Drinkwater before striking his 11th league goal of the season with 13 minutes to go. Riyad Mahrez celebrates scoring his team's first goal with his team mates The Baggies fans left the stadium in droves, but for those who remained there was something late on to cheer when substitute Callum McManaman was brought down in the box before his fellow replacement Lambert sent Kasper Schmeichel the wrong way with the resulting spot-kick. Lambert went close again in the dying minutes, but Leicester held on as they moved up to third in the Premier League table.

Fabricio Coloccini was sent off in first-half stoppage time Sunderland picked up their first win of the season and continued a hot streak of derby form with a 3-0 victory against 10-man Newcastle. Magpies skipper Fabricio Coloccini was dismissed for a last-man challenge on Steven Fletcher, allowing Adam Johnson to fire the hosts in front from the penalty spot late in the first half. Billy Jones then scored his first Sunderland goal to double the lead, before Fletcher sealed the result with a fine volley late on. A vital victory for Sam Allardyce - who becomes the fourth Sunderland manager to beat Newcastle in his second game in charge - moves the Black Cats off the bottom of the table and represents a sixth straight success over their local rivals. Newcastle dominated possession in the first half, putting plenty of pressure on their opponents as they looked to pick up their second win in a row. Costel Pantilimon impressed in goal as Newcastle dominated the first half Georginio Wijnaldum, who starred in the win over Norwich, was involved early on as he played a neat one-two with Aleksandar Mitrovic, but his low effort was well saved by Costel Pantilimon. Jack Colback - playing against his former club - then went close after he met a superb ball from Daryl Janmaat with a first-time volley, but Pantilimon was again there to make the save as he diverted it wide. Adam Johnson fired home from the penalty spot From the resulting corner Mitrovic volleyed wide of the near post as Newcastle looked constantly threatening and the most likely side to score. But then came the game-changing moment, as substitute Jermain Defoe - who replaced the injured Ola Toivonen - slotted a pass through the defence for Fletcher, who was bundled over by Coloccini in the box. Newcastle boss Steve McClaren was left to rue two big refereeing decisions during Sunday's game Newcastle boss Steve McClaren was left to rue two big refereeing decisions during Sunday's game The referee awarded the spot-kick straight away, dismissing the Newcastle skipper before Johnson stepped up to fire the penalty into the bottom corner in the third minute of first-half stoppage time. Coloccini and manager Steve McClaren were visibly furious, remonstrating with the officials, but Sunderland had the lead and never looked back. Sunderland's Billy Jones was delighted to both score in and win the Wear-Tyne derby Sunderland's Billy Jones was delighted to both score in and win the Wear-Tyne derby The hosts gradually pressed their advantage, and Fletcher nearly made it two with a long-range effort which deflected just wide on 65 minutes. But from the resulting corner, Yann M'Vila fired a brilliant low volley at goal which Jones met at the far post to tap in for his first goal for the club. It was very nearly 3-0 seven minutes later as Fletcher played the ball to Johnson, who cut in from the right and fired a rasping effort against the crossbar. Sam Allardyce was pleased to get his first win as Sunderland manager after they came out on top in the Wear-Tyne derby Sam Allardyce was pleased to get his first win as Sunderland manager after they came out on top in the Wear-Tyne derby But, as Newcastle slowly tired and started to leave gaps, Allardyce's men eventually wrapped up the win in the 86th minute with a sweeping counter. Defoe charged into the Newcastle half before finding Younes Kaboul, who chipped a superb ball over the top for Fletcher, and the striker blasted a low volley home to seal Sunderland's latest win over their neighbours - their best derby run.

Charlie Daniels' cross towards Glenn Murray evaded the striker and landed at the feet of the winger, who took one touch before firing a low left-footed shot beyond the diving Tottenham skipper. It was the Scotland international's second goal of the season. Seven minutes later, Eriksen, who had already tried to split the Bournemouth defence, found the path of Kane, who was brought down on the edge of the six-yard box by a sprawling Boruc. Matt Ritchie scored the quickest goal of the Premier League season so far Referee Roger East did not hesitate to point to the spot and Kane scored his second goal of the season from 12 yards out. The afternoon got worse for the home side when Danny Rose's deflected shot fell neatly into the path of Dembele, who had the whole goal to aim at before slotting beneath Boruc. The Polish 'keeper went some way to atone for conceding the earlier penalty when he kept out Toby Alderweireld's back-post header but he handed Spurs their third of the afternoon when he spilled a simple Kane cross at the feet of Lamela for a tap-in from two yards. Kane celeberates scoring his team's fifth goal with Toby Alderweireld Josh King managed to find a yard of space in the Spurs penalty area just before the break but his curling effort bounced back off the far post with Richie blasting the rebound into advertising hoarding. Bournemouth's midfield duo of Dan Gosling and Andrew Surman failed to contain their opposite numbers and were as much spectators as Harry Redknapp, who managed both clubs and was watching from the director's box. Kane scored his second of the afternoon after again combining with Eriksen.

Eriksen then had Boruc beaten from 25 yards but saw his effort come back off the post but it was soon five for Spurs and a hat trick for Kane after Boruc dropped another cross for a simple finish. The victory means Spurs are unbeaten since their opening-day defeat to Manchester United having won five and drawn two.

The game's two best chances fell to United in the final five minutes - Jesse Lingard's effort on the stretch from six yards hitting the crossbar, before Chris Smalling's first-time shot forced a fine save out of Joe Hart. But the title rivals had to settle for a point after playing out the first goalless Manchester derby in five years; a fixture that has provided an average of 3.75 goals per game over the same period. Raheem Sterling sees his effort on goal blocked in the first half The result means City return to top spot in the Premier League on goal difference from Arsenal, while United sit fourth - two points behind their neighbours. The first half was lacking in chances with both defences on top, and was only the second Premier League game this season not to see a shot on target in the first 45 minutes. Two half-chances did fall for Yaya Toure but his header from Kevin De Bruyne's corner fell just wide of David De Gea's right post, before he fluffed his effort from 15 yards after De Bruyne's fine centre. Anthony Martial is fouled by Fernandinho at Old Trafford The contest opened up after the break, with three clear chances falling to Louis van Gaal's side. Chrs Smalling's header from Juan Mata's corner bounced just inches in front of Morgan Schneiderlin as he looked to tap home, before the ball fell just the wrong side of the post. Man City boss Manuel Pellegrini was pleased to take a point from Old Trafford Man City boss Manuel Pellegrini was pleased to take a point from Old Trafford United came closest on 85 minutes when substitute Lingard latched on to a fine Anthony Martial ball over the top of the City defence, and his outstretched effort had the beating of Hart but bounced back off the crossbar and clear. Then, with just two minutes remaining, Smalling's low shot from 10 yards at the near post was tipped wide by the outstretched glove of Hart.

"Jurgen Klopp reacts to Sadio Mane's late equaliser Jurgen Klopp was denied his first victory as Liverpool manager as Southampton fought back to draw 1-1 at Anfield. In a game of few clear chances, it looked as though Christian Benteke had secured victory for the Reds when he came off the bench and scored a fine header in the 77th minute. However, Sadio Mane bundled in an equaliser with four minutes remaining before being sent off in injury-time for two quick bookings. The draw is Liverpool's eighth stalemate in their last nine matches in all competitions and again they lacked a cutting edge in the final third, with just two shots on target. Liverpool's Philippe Coutinho controls the ball under pressure Their options up front were still limited, though, as Daniel Sturridge missed out through injury while Benteke and Roberto Firmino were only fit enough to start on the bench. Liverpool's only change from their Europa League draw against Rubin Kazan on Thursday saw Lucas come in to replace Joe Allen while goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg returned for Saints and Jordy Clasie made his first Premier League start in place of James Ward-Prowse. There was little action to speak of in the opening 45 minutes, with Virgil van Dijk spurning Saints' best chance with a miscued header from a free-kick and Alberto Moreno blazing over at the other end. Christian Benteke of Liverpool celebrates scoring his team's first goal against Southampton But the introduction of Benteke at half-time gave Liverpool more presence up front and they made a promising start to the second half. Moreno, who earned the second-loudest cheer of the afternoon after recovering at least five yards on Mane to put in a goal-saving tackle, drilled a shot across the face of goal from the narrowest of angles, with nobody there to turn it in. When the deadlock was eventually broken in the 77th minute, it was no surprise that it was Benteke who made the breakthrough. James Milner swung a cross in from the right and the Belgian rose highest to power a header into the top corner. Southampton's Sadio Mane (3rd R) scored the equaliser at Anfield Joy and relief exploded around Anfield but Liverpool's celebrations were cut short when Mane bundled home the equaliser at the far post after the hosts failed to defend a late free-kick. The goal continued Southampton's unbeaten away record away in the Premier League this season, even if Mane was not there at the end to celebrate it having been shown two yellow cards in quick succesion.

Jordan Ayew put Sherwood's side ahead on 62 minutes, heading past Lukasz Fabianski after Gabriel Agbonlahor's accurate cross, but Gylfi Sigurdsson equalised six minutes later direct from a free-kick. Both teams had chances to win the game as it opened up in the final 20 minutes, but in the battle of the Ayew brothers, Andre Ayew had the final say, turning home Kyle Naughton's dangerous cross in the 87th minute to condemn Sherwood and Villa to their sixth consecutive defeat in the Premier League. Tim Sherwood watched his side lose their eighth Premier League game in their last 10 Swansea move up to 11th after their first away win of term but Villa remain in 19th place - and could finish the weekend bottom of the table if Sunderland beat Newcastle on Sunday in the Wear-Tyne derby. Villa are only the 10th side to lose eight or more of their opening 10 Premier League matches in a season, and of the previous nine, five were relegated at the end of the campaign. Aston Villa manager Tim Sherwood says his side lacked quality as they slumped to another defeat Aston Villa manager Tim Sherwood says his side lacked quality as they slumped to another defeat Both sides looked short of confidence in a first-half that was low on quality. Villa started brightly, but the best opportunity fell to Swansea defender Federico Fernandez from a corner on 12 minutes. The centre-back could not keep his composure, though, and blazed over from six yards out after a knock down from Bafetimbi Gomis. The striker, who has now failed to score in six successive Premier League appearances after finding the net nine times in his previous 10 games, worked hard in attack but was starved of service as neither side could get a grip on the midfield. Kyle Naughton and Kieran Richardson compete in the air for the ball Rudy Gestede rose well from a corner to head over Villa's clearest opportunity just before half-time. The second half was in complete contrast to the first, as both teams opened up and looked to attack. Villa forced two quick chances just after the break, while Gomis almost got on the end of a deflected effort from Jonjo Shelvey. The deadlock was eventually broken through Jordan Ayew, as the Ghana international finished off a counter-attack to score his first Premier League goal after Brad Guzan had denied his brother Andre seconds earlier at the opposite end. Aston Villa's Jordan Ayew celebrates after scoring their opener The Villa Park crowd had just six minutes to celebrate their lead, though, as Guzan was soon picking the ball out of the net. Sigurdsson won a free-kick 25 yards out and dispatched it expertly past the Villa 'keeper's despairing dive. His strike was the 30th goal or assist from the Iceland international in 60 appearances for Garry Monk's side. Jordan Ayew (r) and Gylfi Sigurdsson in action Swansea looked the more likely to grab the winner, and did so through Andre Ayew with three minutes to play. Kieran Richardson was struggling to keep tabs on Swans substitute Modou Barrow, but it was Naughton who got free down Swansea's right to deliver the perfect cross for Ayew to slide home. Garry Monk has said he's silenced his doubters after his Swansea side ended a poor run of form with victory Garry Monk has said he's silenced his doubters after his Swansea side ended a poor run of form with victory Joleon Lescott had an opportunity to grab a dramatic equaliser in stoppage time, but the defender could only guide his volley over the bar from six yards out. Swansea welcome Arsenal to the Liberty Stadium next Saturday, while the pressure mounts on Sherwood at Villa Park. His side face Southampton in the Capital One Cup on Wednesday, but this defeat will not dampen calls for a managerial change. Phil Thompson's Soccer Saturday verdict \"[Villa] did enough to get a point out of this game no doubt but I think both sides were extremely nervous. Both sides didn't create enough, work the goalkeepers enough. \"It's going to be extremely difficult. They've got Spurs, City and Everton. [Tim Sherwood] went for more experience and changed things. Right at the very end, [Joleon] Lescott's got a glorious chance and and he's put it over the bar. There's a lot of good things - not great things - but Villa certainly did enough to get a point.\" Phil Thompson gives his view on Aston Villa's 2-1 home defeat to Swansea Phil Thompson gives his view

Leicester won 1-0 at home to Crystal Palace to remain fifth. Vardy superbly converted Riyad Mahrez' pass after a Brede Hangeland mistake on the hour-mark at the King Power Stadium as he became only the eight player - alongside the likes of Thierry Henry and Alan Shearer - to score in seven successive Premier League games. Leicester are now level on points with Manchester United, albeit having played a game more. Reaction from Leicester City's Jamie Vardy, who scored for the seventh straight Premier League game Reaction from Leicester City's Jamie Vardy, who scored for the seventh straight Premier League game The match was one of few chances, with Marc Albrighton's shot which hit the post early in the first half the next best chance of note. Palace felt they should have had a penalty when substitute Wilfried Zaha went to ground in the box under the challenge of Christian Fuchs but Kasper Schmeichel was not a busy man as Leicester secured their first clean sheet of the season. The victory came through another moment of magic from Vardy, whose reputation continues to grow with every game. Matt Le Tissier gives his view on Leicester's 1-0 home win against Crystal Palace Matt Le Tissier gives his view on Leicester's 1-0 home win against Crystal Palace Prior to the goal, he was quiet, but played with a rippling confidence after it, although he never had any other good chances to add to his tally. Both teams adopted an attacking outlook in the opening stages but the game soon settled into the pattern of Leicester pressing hard when out of possession and playing a cautious style when they had the ball. Albrighton struck the foot of the post on the eight-minute mark, cutting in from the right wing and beating Wayne Hennessey in the Palace goal. Crystal Palace boss Alan Pardew says his side made one mistake which effectively cost them the game Crystal Palace boss Alan Pardew says his side made one mistake which effectively cost them the game Mahrez reached the rebound first but his effort was hurried and poor, and flew at least a yard wide of the far post. Palace's best attacking play throughout the contest came through their left-winger Yannick Bolasie but his tendency to cut inside onto his favoured right side often saw his path cut off by the sizeable presence of Wes Morgan. On 38 minutes, Bolasie played in Yohan Cabaye but the midfielder shot straight at Schmeichel, who was never really extended at any point of the match. James McArthur and Riyad Mahrez compete for the ball The tentative sparring continued until the 60th minute, when Hangeland made a mess of a routine clearance, stretching to touch the ball to an unmarked Mahrez. Mahrez's pass was perfectly weighted into Vardy's feet but he still had some work to do, and expertly lifted the ball over Hennessey, who had left his line at full speed, before slamming it into the net. Palace took chances by committing extra players to attack as the game went on and might have got a point had the referee taken a different view on a Zaha tumble which could have gone either way. But Vardy was again the difference. Jamie Vardy nets for Leicester, who are up to fifth Matt Le Tissier's Soccer Saturday verdict \"It was a decent enough game but without really the quality in the final third that we've been used to from these two teams in the final third this season. I don't remember the 'keepers having to make a shedload of saves. I think Kaspar Schmeichel probably made a few from long-range efforts but it was just one piece of quality from Jamie Vardy that separated the two teams, even though it was really gifted to him by Brede Hangeland. \"Crystal Palace just didn't seem to have that focal point. I think Fraizer Campbell didn't have any impact on the game whatsoever; you expect the three lads in behind him to cause a few problems but they need somebody there to bounce off. Patrick Bamford came on but he had very little impact on the game as well. They lacked that little bit of creativity but you've got to give credit to Leicester, who defended pretty well.\" Player ratings Leicester: Schmeichel (6), Simpson (6), Morgan (7), Huth (6), Fuchs (6), Albrighton (6), Drinkwater (6), Kante (6), Schlupp (7), Mahrez (6), Vardy (8).

The club's record signing rose to powerfully head the visitors into the lead a minute after the restart when James McClean expertly found the Venezuelan with a left-footed cross.

James McClean of West Brom and Nathan Redmond of Norwich City compete for the ball Alex Neil's side - who have now suffered three straight defeats - started the brighter and were happy for West Brom to hit long passes towards top scorer Saido Berahino and Rondon. Nathan Redmond and Matty Jarvis enjoyed early possession with the later terrorising the Baggies' right-hand flank. The former West Ham winger created the home side's best chance before the interval when his right-footed cross evaded the head of Dieumerci Mbokani but found its way into the path of strike partner Redmond. Alex Neil says Norwich's defending was not good enough Alex Neil says Norwich's defending was not good enough However, the outstretched 21-year-old was unable to control his volley and the chance went begging. Chris Brunt, who was booked for a second half foul on Wes Hoolahan, had already tested John Ruddy in the Norwich goal with a fierce sixth-minute drive from the left hand corner of the penalty area. The England keeper was at full tilt to keep the effort out and later smothered another effort from the Northern Ireland midfielder after it took an awkward deflection. Tony Pulis says he's pleased with West Brom's performance at Norwich Tony Pulis says he's pleased with West Brom's performance at Norwich A sliding Rondon was unable to get on the end of a Craig Dawson cross soon after and found himself in the net instead of the ball.

Jonathan Howson of Norwich and Claudio Yacob of West Brom battle West Brom did strike moments after the restart but Norwich responded well and set about immediately in their pursuit of an equaliser. Jarvis continued to cause West Brom problems down the left but deliveries often lacked quality.

Deeney - a prolific scorer for the Vicarage Road side as they won promotion from the Championship last season - broke the deadlock shortly before half-time to end a run of 857 minutes of top-flight football without a goal before Almen Abdi sealed the away success. The results sees Watford climb to 13th and prevents Stoke from enjoying their best points return from the opening 10 games of a Premier League campaign. Stoke dominated much of the first half without making many chances but even so, Hughes will have wondered how his side trailed at the break. Watford began brightly without posing much of a threat themselves and as time went on, it seemed inevitable that the hosts would take the lead. Geoff Cameron of Stoke City and Troy Deeney of Watford compete for the ball Charlie Adam was their most dangerous outlet and he fired an early warning as he drilled low past the post after collecting the ball from Xherdan Shaqiri. Stoke lost Geoff Cameron to a thigh injury soon after but it didn't seem to interrupt their momentum as he was replaced by Marc Wilson. Watford's head coach Quique Sanchez Flores says he's delighted with his side's victory at Stoke City Watford's head coach Quique Sanchez Flores says he's delighted with his side's victory at Stoke City Adam went close again after Watford made a hash of clearing their lines and his well-hit half volley needed a deflection to take it behind and away from goal. Hughes' men should have gone in front just before the half-hour mark through Marko Arnautovic, who will undoubtedly have gone into the interval ruing his miss. The Austrian nodded a straightforward header over the bar after Shaqiri centred for him following decent build-up play - and that was a clear turning point. Odion Ighalo of Watford is chased by Stoke's Glen Johnson Suddenly Watford burst into life and having barely gone upfield, they hit the woodwork twice in the space of 10 seconds. Ikechi Anya did well to cross from the byline and Odion Ighalo's header was firm but off the stanchion. Ighalo recovered to feed to Abdi and he eventually turned the ball on to Deeney but he leaned back too much as he opened up to shoot and he struck the face of the bar. Just when it seemed as though his drought was to continue, the visitors went ahead with a couple of minutes of the first half remaining. Deeney received the ball 20 yards out and he took a touch to bring himself into a more central area before side-footing past Jack Butland with a fine, low finish inside the near post. His relief was tangible as he wheeled away in celebration after finally bringing his long wait for a top-flight goal to an end following 21 in all competitions last season. Deeney shows composure to slot past Jack Butland in the first half Stoke tried to keep pushing after the restart but frustration quickly set in as they found it hard to make openings. Shaquiri sent a lazy effort high and wide and Heurelho Gomes had to adjust well to keep an Adam corner out before the Scot also shot over. In response, Ighalo was denied a penalty but was undeterred as he fired a rasping volley goalwards only to see it blocked when it was heading in. With the game delicately poised with quarter of it remaining, Watford killed off Stoke with a ruthless finish. Wilson was far too slack coming out of defence and Ighalo was able to dispossess him before teeing up Abdi, who hammered home from the edge of the area to the delight of away fans. Alman Abdi celebrates scoring Watford's second goal with team-mate Troy Deeney at Stoke Etienne Capoue could have added a third but the fact he didn't will have been inconsequential to the near 3,000 supporters who travelled north. They had seen their team record a fine victory and Flores' team are providing to be a competitive addition to the division at present.

Mourinho, who was sent to the stands for the second half, watched West Ham grab the three points through Carroll's header into the bottom corner from eight yards, just 10 minutes after the striker had come on. Mauro Zarate had put West Ham ahead with a fine effort into the bottom corner from the edge of the area, before Nemanja Matic was sent off for two bookings in the space of nine minutes. West Ham's Mauro Zarate celebrates after scoring the opener Mourinho - who swerved his media conference after the game - was dismissed during the half-time period along with coach Silvino Louro, but though his side equalised in the 56th minute through Gary Cahill's close-range finish, Carroll's late winner denied them a point. West Ham are now second in the Premier League after their sixth win of the season, while Chelsea sit 15th on just 11 points from 10 games. The hosts, who had won just one of their last 18 games against Chelsea, went ahead on 17 minutes after Dimitri Payet's corner fell to Zarate at the far post, the Argentine firing an unstoppable half-volley past Asmir Begovic from 18 yards. Gary Cahill celebrates with Chelsea team-mates after his equaliser The Hammers continued to allow Chelsea to play in front of them in the first half, and the visitors were nearly level twice in the space of three minutes. First, Willian's free-kick from 20 yards was saved well by Adrian down to his right, before Kurt Zouma's header from Cesc Fabregas' corner was cleared from under the bar by Manuel Lanzini and then Adrian, with the Goal Decision System showing the ball was an inch from going fully over the line. Slaven Bilic admits Chelsea's disallowed goal had a significant impact on West Ham's 2-1 win Slaven Bilic admits Chelsea's disallowed goal had a significant impact on West Ham's 2-1 win West Ham should have made it 2-0 just before half-time, but Lanzini's lofted effort from Payet's through ball went over both Begovic and the bar. Chelsea then went down to 10 men when Matic, who had earlier been booked for pulling back Cheikhou Kouyate, was given another yellow card for a needless block on the same player on the touchline. Nemanja Matic leaves the pitch after being shown a red card for two first-half bookings Mourinho - who already has a suspended stadium ban hanging over him for previous indiscretions - was sent off during the break, and watched the second half from the stands at Upton Park. Cahill dragged his side back level with a finish from six yards after Zouma had caused problems in the West Ham area from a corner, and the 10 men could have gone ahead just before Carroll's winner. Eden Hazard, breaking forward on the counter attack, fed Ramires in a good position 16 yards out, but the Brazilian's weak effort fell into the grateful hands of Adrian. And West Ham earned another superb win under Slaven Bilic through striker Carroll, who rose highest to nod home Aaron Cresswell's left-wing cross for his first goal since January. Mourinho was seen leaving the directors' box in the final 10 minutes of the game, and did not appear after the match to take part in media duties. Menawhile, Bilic's side are now unbeaten in seven Premier League games, their best run in the Premier League for 15 years. Chelsea's poor start by numbers 15 - goals scored so far this term does not compare favourably with the same period last season, by which point they had plundered 26 19 - times their goal has been breeched this term. Last season the Blues conceded just 32 goals, making them the Premier League's tightest defence 6 - the loss to West Ham was just the sixth London derby defeat Mourinho has tasted in 53 Premier League

half Arsenal capped off an excellent week with a 2-1 home victory over Everton that moves them to the top of the Premier League. Olivier Giroud followed up his goal in Tuesday's Champions League win over Bayern Munich by heading the Gunners in front after 36 minutes of Saturday night's Emirates Stadium encounter. Laurent Koscielny doubled the advantage shortly afterwards, but a deflected strike from Ross Barkley pulled Everton back into contention before the break.

The result continues a fantastic month for Arsenal after victories over Manchester United, Watford and Bayern and sees them move a point ahead of Manchester City, who play at rivals United on Sunday. Arsene Wenger said he was proud of his players for the focus they showed against Everton Arsene Wenger said he was proud of his players for the focus they showed against Everton Arsene Wenger made three changes from the side that beat Bayern in midweek, handing starts to Giroud, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Gabriel.

Everton manager Roberto Martinez felt they should have taken something from their defeat to Arsenal in the Barclays Premier league. The Toffees' last win at Arsenal was almost 20 years ago but they had the best chance of a quiet opening half hour as Petr Cech could only push out a cross and John Stones volleyed the rebound over the bar. Arsenal had looked most threatening from corners and when they did take the lead in the 36th minute, it came from a header. Ozil clipped a ball into the box and Giroud beat Tim Howard to flick into the net. Before Everton could regroup, they were 2-0 down. Olivier Giroud, Phil Jagielka and John Stones battle for the ball This time it was Santi Cazorla with the pinpoint ball in, whipping a free-kick on the left through the six-yard box where Koscielny again got ahead of Howard to nod in a second goal. Everton were, however, handed a way back into the match a minute before the break. Barkley broke down the left and drilled in a shot which took a wicked deflection off the trailing leg of Gabriel and flew past Cech. The match remained open in the second half as both defences were stretched on the break. Giroud was inches away from a second goal on 68 minutes when Ozil delivered another slide-rule pass and the France international forward fired past Howard, but was denied by the crossbar. Lukaku also hit the bar at the other end with a header from Gareth Barry's cross. As the clock ran down, Everton continued to press and Deulofeu found himself in space on the right side of a crowded penalty area - but Cech was out quickly to make a superb block. Laurent Koscielny (left) celebrates after scoring Arsenal's second goal In stoppage time, Ozil struck the base of the post from the edge of the area before Barry was shown a second yellow card for a trip on substitute Kieran Gibbs as Everton finished with 10 men. Arsenal's next assignment is the Capital One Cup tie at Sheffield Wednesday, live on Sky Sports on Tuesday night, when Everton host Norwich at Goodison Park.

Five first-half shots resulted in five goals, and a huge amount of entertainment. Wijnaldum opened the scoring, before Dieumerci Mbokani brought the Canaries level with a goal on his full league debut. A Wijnaldum header and an Ayoze Perez strike put the hosts two goals in front, but they shot themselves in the foot again, leaving Nathan Redmond unmarked at the back post to narrow the deficit. Aleksandar Mitrovic was ecstatic after scoring After the break, Norwich threw everything at Steve McClaren's side but, somewhat against the run of play, Aleksandar Mitrovic scored a fine fourth, before Wijnaldum completed his hat-trick and netted a thunderous sixth to make sure of the victory. Steven Taylor and Dietmar Hamann analyse all four of Georginio Wijnaldum's goals in Newcastle's 6-2 win over Norwich Steven Taylor and Dietmar Hamann analyse all four of Georginio Wijnaldum's goals in Newcastle's 6-2 win over Norwich The result sees Newcastle move up to 18th but, more importantly, they have the momentum going into next week's crucial Wear-Tyne derby clash with arch rivals Sunderland. Norwich drop to 16th. Newcastle boss McClaren called for a fast start from his side pre-match, and that is exactly what he got after 14 minutes, thanks to Wijnaldum. Steve McClaren tries to organise side in thriller Moussa Sissoko was urged to shoot from supporters around the ground, but instead he threaded a delightful through-ball into the path of Wijnaldum, who made no mistake from the angle. Norwich were not to be deterred, and after Robbie Brady had seen his effort come back off the post, Mbokani got on the end of a Martin Olsson cross to side-foot his first goal for the club on 20 minutes. The action was relentless, and another inch-perfect cross, this time from the impressive Sissoko, allowed Wijnaldum the chance to get his side back in front on 26 minutes, and he duly obliged, heading past John Ruddy. Ayoze Perez celebrates getting on the scoresheet Perez looked to have put Newcastle into a comfortable position when he reacted first to his own strike after it had been blocked by Olsson on 33 minutes, getting the ball out of his feet and lashing home. However, once again, Newcastle didn't make things easy for themselves, as they left Redmond unmarked from another Olsson cross on 35 minutes, after Wijnaldum had failed to track his run, and the England U21 winger calmly volleyed his side back into the game. After the interval, Norwich upped the ante, and Wijnaldum had to be alert to divert a Sebastien Bassong header off the line, but against the run of the play Newcastle increased their lead on 64 minutes, thanks to a man quickly becoming a fan favourite on Tyneside. Cheick Tiote and Nathan Redmond tangle at St James' It was Sissoko again who instigated the move, playing a one-two with Perez, before lofting a perfect ball over the top for Mitrovic, who lashed the ball past Ruddy. There was an air of controversy about Newcastle's fifth, with two home players jumping for a Janmaat cross in front of Ruddy appearing to be in an offside position. However, Wijnaldum arrived in between the two to complete his hat-trick as he headed Newcastle into a 5-2 lead. Steve McClaren showed relief after Newcastle's 6-2 win over Norwich, and hopes the result can transform their season Steve McClaren showed relief after Newcastle's 6-2 win over Norwich, and hopes the result can transform their season Norwich again hit the post after a fizzing Redmond effort beat Rob Elliot in the Newcastle goal, but a stunning Wijnaldum strike completed the rout on 86 minutes, via a slight deflection. Eight goals is the most we have seen in any Premier League game this season, and in this form, Sunderland will have to be wary of Wijnaldum and his team-mates who will be gunning for more in next week's derby.

The Reds started fiercely with a high-pressing game and almost took the lead early on when Divock Origi, starting in place of the injured Daniel Sturridge, hit the bar with a close-range header. Spurs recovered and finished the first half strongly, with Simon Mignolet producing a superb one-handed stop to deny Clinton N'Jie and also keeping out an effort from Harry Kane. And, in a second half bereft of clear chances, late shots from Kane and Emre Can were the closest either side came to a winner at White Hart Lane. Klopp instructs his players during the match The draw stretches Spurs' unbeaten league run to eight matches and also means Gerard Houllier remains the only Liverpool manager to win his first Premier League game in charge. After a week of shocking injuries, with two first-team players Danny Ings and Joe Gomez ruled out for the season, Klopp had to deal with another blow just hours before kick-off. Sturridge was ruled out with a knee problem despite travelling with the squad and he was replaced by Origi, while Adam Lallana came in for Ings. Erik Lamela battles for the ball with Liverpool's Alberto Moreno Having made his first business this week to watch Liverpool's U21s, Klopp also featured three youngsters on the bench who have not appeared at all yet this term; Jerome Sinclair, Joao Teixeira and Connor Randall. Pochettino, meanwhile, changed two from the draw at Swansea, with Moussa Dembele replacing the suspended Eric Dier and Danny Rose coming in at left-back for Ben Davies. It was Origi who almost rewarded the visitors' ferocious opening 10 minutes when he headed Can's flick on against the crossbar. Spurs' biggest issue was whether Dembele could fill the shoes of Dier in midfield - and the Belgian was impressive as he won a string of key tackles before half-time. The former Borussia Dortmund boss gestures on the touchline during the goalless draw The hosts had two fine chances to take the lead too, first when N'Jie, who replaced Nacer Chadli after the Belgian picked up an injury on 10 minutes, was put through by Kane and forced Mignolet to tip wide with the outside of his boot. Kane was then one-on-one with the Reds keeper but shot straight at his legs before Dele Alli's rebound was cleared off the line by Mamadou Sakho. Clear chances were at a premium in the second half, with a timid shot from Lucas allowing Hugo Lloris to easily gather and Kyle Walker failing to test Mignolent with two equally tame shots from distance. Tottenham's Dele Alli looks to catch Emre Can But Kane should again have beaten Mignolet in the 83rd minute when he was clear in space and had the whole goal to aim for from the edge of the box, but shot close to the 'keeper's body. Can then went close for Liverpool in the final minute of normal time when his low shot from distance whistled past the far post. Chadli, who was carried off on a stretcher after his early injury, will be assessed by the Tottenham medical team in the coming days but the Spurs manager fears ankle ligament damage. The Jurgen Klopp era at Liverpool began with a goalless draw at Tottenham The Jurgen Klopp era at Liverpool began with a goalless draw at Tottenham \"We need to assess tomorrow and after tomorrow we will know more,\" Pochettino said. \"Maybe it's a problem in his ankle ligaments but we hope it is not a big, big issue. \"After the game it was painful and in the next 24 or 48 hours we will be able to see better how the injury is.\" Liverpool's performance surpassed Klopp's expectations coming into the match, and the manager was pleased with his side's fast start to the game. \"I am satisfied with the start because I didn't have the biggest expectation,\" Klopp said after the 0-0 draw at White Hart Lane. \"Tottenham are a very strong and well-tuned team. It was difficult but I am really satisfied. Our start was brilliant and we surprised their team a little bit. \"The problem we had in the game was that, when we had the ball, we weren't cool enough, nor used our skills. We were too hectic. We didn't see the right option, when you should open your view. \"We had our moments, but after three or four days with the team it was brilliant.\" Player ratings Tottenham: Lloris 7, Walker 6,

"Diego Costa returned with a goal as Chelsea beat Aston Villa Chelsea returned to winning ways as they beat Aston Villa 2-0 at Stamford Bridge on Saturday afternoon. Diego Costa profited from a defensive mix-up for the visitors as the Blues looked to bounce back from the 3-1 defeat to Southampton before the international break. The unfortunate Alan Hutton then diverted the ball into his own net shortly after the break, and the visitors never really looked like getting back into the game. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho says he isn't worried by his side's position in the Premier League Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho says he isn't worried by his side's position in the Premier League It's Chelsea's second home win of the season and only their third in the opening nine games, but it's a vital result for Mourinho's men as they look to kick-start their campaign. The hosts looked nervy in the opening stages, with Villa trying to take advantage and attacking regularly down the right-hand side, putting pressure on debutant Baba. Chelsea kept a clean sheet for only the second time this season Alan Hutton was having plenty of joy along that wing, but he spurned a good chance early on as he worked space in the box, but then fired straight at Asmir Begovic before missing the rebound. Jordan Ayew then went close as he curled a free kick on to the roof of the net, before Rudy Gestede should have put Sherwood's men in front, somehow lifting Ayew's cross over the bar with an outstretched leg from close range. John Terry headed over from a Willian free kick, but moments later Chelsea took the lead after a howler from Brad Guzan in the 34th minute. The goalkeeper played a terrible ball out to Joleon Lescott and Willian was able to steal the ball, before moving into the box and squaring to Costa, who had the simplest of finishes to put the hosts in front. Chelsea celebrate Costa's opener Mourinho's men started the second half much better than they did the first, and on 54 minutes their lead was doubled. Cesc Fabregas clipped a superb ball over the top for Costa, who did well to bring the ball down in the box and cut back on to his right. His attempted pass was blocked by Hutton, but the ball looped off his leg and beyond Guzan before rolling into the net. Aston Villa manager Tim Sherwood was left frustrated after mistakes led to his side's 2-0 defeat to Chelsea Aston Villa manager Tim Sherwood was left frustrated after mistakes led to his side's 2-0 defeat to Chelsea Villa looked dejected after a massive slice of luck for the hosts, and Chelsea looked more likely to score again than the visitors did to pull one back. Pedro curled wide from a good position, but Sherwood's men did have a good chance as a Carles Gil free kick was met by Lescott, who couldn't connect with a header properly. The ball did drop for him, but Cesar Azpilicueta made a vital block to stop him firing home from close range. Grealish struggled to make an impact as Aston Villa lacked fight in the second half Fabregas missed an opportunity to make it three late on as he started and finished a move, playing the ball out to Willian before racing into the box to meet his return ball, but the Spaniard could only flash a shot wide of the far post. With Villa looking out of ideas, Chelsea were able to see out the closing stages comfortably and take a well-needed win as well as securing just their second clean sheet of the season. Phil Thompson gives his thoughts on Chelsea’s 2-0 win against Aston Villa at Stamford Bridge Phil Thompson gives his thoughts on Chelsea’s 2-0 win against Aston Villa at Stamford Bridge Soccer Saturday verdict - Phil Thompson A few weeks ago Joe Mourinho said his side needed a break, and Brad Guzan must have been listening as he gifted them the first goal. Then another gift, as the deflection for Chelsea's second beat Guzan. If Jose wanted a break, he got two in one go. The first half was quite easy, but the second was a canter for Chelsea. It was like a different Villa team in the second half, so negative. For all that possession, they just didn't get forward. It really was dreadful from Villa in the second half. From what I saw, I do fear for Villa.

Carl Jenkinson put West Ham ahead in the 22nd minute, before Palace midfielder Yohan Cabaye equalised from the spot just moments later. After winning the penalty, Dwight Gayle went from hero to zero before half-time, receiving a second yellow for a needless foul on Cheikhou Kouyate. Diafra Sakho and Brede Hangeland compete for the ball The Hammers left it late to retake the lead, Manuel Lanzini scoring two minutes from time from close range, before Dimitri Payet finished deep in stoppage time for 3-1. The result leaves West Ham on 17 points from their nine games, and the win was their fourth away success of the season. After a frantic start, the visitors took the lead through defender Jenkinson, who was found superbly behind the defence by Victor Moses, before slotting under Wayne Hennessey from 12 yards. Yohan Cabaye scored Crystal Palace's equaliser from the spot But a minute later Jenkinson was at fault for bringing down Gayle just inside the area, allowing Cabaye the chance to equalise from the penalty spot. He scored, but Mark Clattenburg ordered a retake after blatant infringement from Gayle, and on the second attempt Cabaye found the net again despite Adrian getting a hand to the Frenchman's penalty. Palace had a fine chance to take the lead before half-time, but Puncheon's centre to an unmarked Wilfried Zaha was slightly behind the winger, and they went into the break with 10 men after Gayle's second booking. Dwight Gayle is shown a second yellow card for a late tackle on Cheikhou Kouyate First, the forward cynically brought down Payet in midfield, and then 13 minutes later went flying in on Kouyate deep inside the West Ham half, catching the midfielder for a clear second yellow. West Ham piled on the pressure in the second half, hitting the post through Diafra Sakho's effort after Jenkinson's cross, but the introduction of striker Andy Carroll was telling. Alan Pardew believes the referee was harsh to send Dwight Gayle off in West Ham’s 3-1 win over Crystal Palace Alan Pardew believes the referee was harsh to send Dwight Gayle off in West Ham’s 3-1 win over Crystal Palace With two minutes remaining, Carroll nodded down a cross towards Lanzini, who smashed home from eight yards to put Slaven Bilic's side ahead again.

another in an impressive 3-0 win. Morgan Schneiderlin (18) and Herrera (22) scored within four first-half minutes before the Spaniard laid on a third after the break for Wayne Rooney (62). Rooney's goal - a first on the road in the league in 11 months and a 187th in the Premier League - drew him level with Andy Cole in second place on the all-time list and capped a United performance far removed from their meek display at Arsenal before the international break. Wayne Rooney says he is happy to have ended his six-game goal-scoring drought at former club Everton Wayne Rooney says he is happy to have ended his six-game goal-scoring drought at former club Everton On the face of it a trip to Goodison Park - scene of three straight league defeats - looked an unappetising follow-up to that Emirates surrender, all the more so given the simmering emotion among the home supporters following the morning news of Howard Kendall's death. But United were composed on the ball, organised without it and all-round value for a result that keeps them two points off Manchester City ahead of of next week's derby. Everton and Manchester United join in a minute's applause for Howard Kendall before kick-off Other than a brief spell of Everton pressure after the break United were in total control, and Louis van Gaal's reshuffle paid off as Schneiderlin and Herrera - both back in the United midfield - put the game almost beyond Everton by the midway point in the first half. Schneiderlin's goal, passed into the corner neatly after Marcos Rojo and Chris Smalling had kept a half-cleared corner alive, was his first for United, while Herrera's had more than a hint of Paul Scholes about it as he arrived in the box late to head in Rojo's left-wing cross. Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal was pleased with his side's performance Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal was pleased with his side's performance Van Gaal used Herrera behind Rooney and Anthony Martial on the left, and the system worked as Everton found Herrera an elusive presence and struggled to contain Martial's direct running as the game wore on. The teenager might have scored from Rooney's cut-back before the break, only for Seamus Coleman to intervene, while at the other end Ross Barkley's crack from a tight angle was as much as David De Gea had to deal with. Chris Smalling had a strong game as he coped well with the physical presence of Romelu Lukaku United's goalkeeper was called into serious action early in the second half, deflecting Romelu Lukaku's side-footer to safety with an outstretched left leg, and Barkley did clip the frame of the goal with a late free-kick. But they were isolated moments of alarm, and by the time of Barkley's effort United were three-up, Rooney finishing inside Tim Howard's near post after Phil Jagielka's awful pass sparked a quick counter-attack. The former Goodison idol raised a hand in apology and almost had to repeat the gesture moments later as another poor piece of defending from Jagielka left him one-on-one. Howard won that duel, but the damage was done. Matt Le Tissier gives his thoughts on Manchester United 3-0 win away to Everton at Goodison Park Matt Le Tissier gives his thoughts on Manchester United 3-0 win away to Everton at Goodison Park Soccer Saturday Verdict - Matt Le Tissier From the moment United got that second goal, they never looked troubled. They were so solid defensively. David de Gea had to make two saves all game. It was a really professional away performance in the Premier League, and they looked really, really comfortable. Rooney played very well, but seems to have lost some of his pace. Martial had a quiet afternoon and found himself out wide on several occasions, Herrera got himself into some good positions, Smalling had a good battle with Lukaku. Everyone was tidy. Everton gave goals away at bad times. They needed to stay in the game longer after the first goal, and the second killed them.

The England man was in clinical mood to net his first treble of his career as Wilfried Bony also helped himself to two goals against a defensively ragged and injury-hit Bournemouth side.

Raheem Sterling of Manchester City celebrates scoring his team's first goal The day could have turned out very differently if the referee had deemed Nicholas Otamendi, who was the last man, had fouled Dan Gosling inside the area on five minutes after he was released in behind the City defence. Instead, Mike Dean ruled the City man had got the ball. There were slight fears regarding where City's goals would come from with both Sergio Aguero and David Silva ruled out with injury but in their absence Sterling and Bony stepped up. Sterling's first goal came on seven minutes when a Pablo Zabaleta header across the six-yard box was poked into his path by Bony and he made no mistake from close range. Bony doubled the lead three minutes later after visiting goalkeeper Adam Federici, who replaced Arthur Boruc close to kick-off when he was injured in the warm-up, parried a cross into his path inside the six yard box. He simply couldn't miss. Raheem Sterling opens the scoring for Man City against Bournemouth With the game threatening to become embarrassing for Howe's men, they burst into life on 22 minutes. Murray was found on the edge of the box after a brilliant passing move and he finished clinically with a powerful low drive. However, Bournemouth's inability to defend with any authority continued to cost them as Sterling danced past two defenders off the right wing on 29 minutes to slide home from close range.

Manuel Pellegrini says he’s pleased with Manchester City’s dominant performance in their 5-1 win at home to Bournemouth.

However, the midfielder, who hasn't scored in over 50 games, looked like a rabbit caught in the headlights in front of goal and allowed Federici back to make a save before Sterling fired home the rebound.

There could and should have been more goals for Sterling in the second period, but he poked wide from close range on 62 minutes and fired into the side netting four minutes later before he was replaced with the clock running down, as were De Bruyne and Yaya Toure. Bony did add to the scoring with one of the last attacks of the game. Navas made good ground down the right wing before finding the striker in the area, who spun his marker and fired into the bottom. For City it was a case of no Aguero, no problem. But bigger challenges lie ahead. Soccer Saturday verdict: Charlie Nicholas Charlie Nicholas gives his thoughts on Manchester City’s 5-1 win over Bournemouth at the Etihad Charlie Nicholas gives his thoughts on Manchester City’s 5-1 win over Bournemouth at the Etihad Bony was a little rusty as you could imagine. Bournemouth actually started very well, and were kept out by a couple of last-ditch challenges. Then, all of a sudden, a couple of diagonal balls from De Bruyne opened everything up. At 2-1 one, after Murray scored, you think game on, but you cannot defend like that against Man City. Newcastle were bad enough when they crumbled in the second half, but Bournemouth did it in the first half here, and by the time Sterling had got his hat-trick, it was game over. It was a lot of mistakes rather than brilliant football. This could be a springboard for Sterling. In that position, a little deeper, he can run at players, but when Silva comes back, he will have to go back to a wider position.

equaliser Jamie Vardy's second-half double rescued Leicester's unbeaten Premier League away record as Claudio Ranieri's side came from two goals down to draw 2-2 at Southampton. Ronald Koeman's side got off to a flying start as captain Jose Fonte, celebrating a new three-year deal at the club, opened the scoring in the 21st-minute, before Virgil van Dijk extended his side's lead just before the interval. As has already been proved this season Ranieri's Leicester just do not know when they are beaten and pulled a goal back in the 65th minute as Vardy became only the fourth Englishman this century to score in six successive Premier League matches. The in-form England forward had a golden opportunity to make it 10 goals in as many league matches and secure a point for his side with just nine minutes of time remaining, but he fired over from eight yards after excellent work from substitute Riyad Mahrez. Leicester City celebrate Vardy's equaliser However, he was not to be denied again, smashing the ball past Kelvin Davis after being played in by Mahrez in injury time as Leicester, who remain in fifth - three points above Southampton in eighth, extended their unbeaten run on the road to eight games. Leicester, who were unchanged from their victory away at Norwich, started brightly as Marc Albrighton found Vardy on the penalty spot, but the 28-year-old could not keep his shot down. Jamie Vardy says confidence is high in the Leicester camp following another comeback from two goals down following their 2-2 draw away to Southampton Jamie Vardy says confidence is high in the Leicester camp following another comeback from two goals down following their 2-2 draw away to Southampton Southampton, who made two changes from the side that beat Chelsea last time out, slowly grew into the game and looked particularly dangerous from set-pieces as Van Dijk's header beat Kasper Schmeichel but could not beat Danny Drinkwater on the line. They were not to be denied for long though as Fonte climbed highest to head Dusan Tadic's corner past Schmeichel and into the back of the net for his first goal in 18 months. Southampton's Jose Fonte celebrates scoring his sides first goal of the game Southampton doubled their advantage in the 37th minute and it was another set-piece that did the damage. Graziano Pelle's header rebounded off the post and deflected back off Van Dijk and back onto the upright. However, the Dutch defender got another opportunity and poked home into the roof of the net for his second of the season. Leicester's unbeaten away record was hanging by a thread but if there was any sense of hope for Claudio Ranieri's side it came from the fact they have won more points from losing positions than any other top-flight side this season. Claudio Ranieri says the spirit displayed by his Leicester side in their 2-2 fightback against Southampton was ‘fantastic’ Claudio Ranieri says the spirit displayed by his Leicester side in their 2-2 fightback against Southampton was ‘fantastic’ And they could have pulled a goal back just before the break when Robert Huth's quick feet worked an opening for a shot at the far post, but he could not direct his effort on target. Ranieri threw on Nathan Dyer and Mahrez at the break in place of Jeffrey Schlupp and Shinji Okazaki as he tried to haul his side back into the game. Southampton boss Ronald Koeman praised the spirit in which Leicester fought back against his side to draw 2-2 Southampton boss Ronald Koeman praised the spirit in which Leicester fought back against his side to draw 2-2 However, they could have found themselves further behind but for Danny Simpson's challenge after Sadio Mane raced clear and rounded Schmeichel. Despite the chance, Koeman's side started to look sloppy and he reacted by sending on Jordy Clasie and Maya Yoshida for Steven Davis and Cedric Soares, who received a nasty cut in the first half after a clash of heads with Schlupp. Vardy (left) celebrates his first goal of the afternoon with Nathan Dyer The move did not have the desired effect as Vardy powered home Dyer's cross to join Michael Owen, James Beattie and Daniel Sturridge as the fourth Englishman to score in six successive Premier League games this century. Leicester had a spring in their step and they should have been level when the man of the moment was picked out by Mahrez, but Vardy's shot sailed high over the crossbar. However, as the tension grew at the announcement of five minutes' added time, Leicester continued to attack - and when Mahrez sent a through-ball towards Vardy, he atoned for his earlier miss finishing emphatically into the top-right corner to rescue a point. Paul Merson gives his thoughts on Southampton and Leicester’s 2-2 draw at St Mary’s Paul Merson gives his thoughts on Southampton and Leicester’s 2-2 draw at St Mary’s Soccer Saturday Verdict - Paul Merson Southampton played quite well in the first half, and Leicester were a bit off it. Every time they had a corner they looked a threat. Two goals came from them, even if Van Dijk may have been offside for the second. Second half, Leicester made two changes, with Mahrez and Dyer coming on, and Dyer was a different class. Proper wing play. After Leicester's first goal, it was all them. Southampton sat back, and they didn't keep the ball well enough. Vardy is an absolute nightmare for defenders. He never stops running, doesn't give up and is an excellent finisher. The way that Leicester play, they have a go, and it could be either 2-2, or 5-0. Player ratings Southampton: K.

The forward tucked the ball into an empty net in the 54th-minute but Sunderland were adamant he had handled the ball and fouled goalkeeper Costel Pantilimon beforehand. And there were ugly scenes at the final whistle when West Brom's former Black Cats midfielder McClean celebrated the victory in front of the travelling fans, and was confronted by Danny Graham and Lee Cattermole, sparking a melee which involved several players. One goal was always likely to be enough to settle a tight, tense affair which had the feel of a late-season relegation six-pointer. And Allardyce and his team were left cursing their luck with decisions, after their loud appeals for a second-half penalty were turned down. Sam Allardyce was upbeat beforehand but his Sunderland reign began with a defeat Sunderland began brightly and had much the better of the first 20 minutes, knocking the ball around with surprising panache considering they were still hunting a first Premier League win of the season. And Cattermole and Steven Fletcher had efforts blocked by Gareth McAuley and Jonny Evans respectively, after a neat passing move. James McClean and Danny Graham clashed after full time., McLean having appeared to gesture towards the away fans. James McClean and Danny Graham clashed after full time., McLean having appeared to gesture towards the away fans. From the resulting corner, Billy Jones sent a diving header arrowing towards goal after the ball had bounced off Fabio Borini but Boaz Myhill produced a brilliant reflex save. However, West Brom gradually began to take charge, although the lack of a cutting edge which has been an issue this season was again there for all to see. The recalled Stephane Sessegnon was their most enterprising player, making several promising runs down the right and also firing wide of the post from the edge of the box. Yann M'Vila tries to block a James McClean cross at the Hawthorns But shots on target were thin on the ground and the home fans were in a disgruntled mood at the interval, while Allardyce could be satisfied with his first half in charge. The Baggies had a penalty appeal turned down after the break, when a Salomon Rondon header smacked into Younes Kaboul's arm. But referee Martin Atkinson looked far more favourably on them shortly afterwards when Chris Brunt whipped over a fine cross from the left, Pantilimon failed to gather, and Berahino tucked the ball into the net as it trickled towards the goal after bouncing off his boot and John O'Shea's leg. Pantilimon was booked for leading the Sunderland protests, convinced the ball had hit both of Berahino's hands as it dropped, but visiting fans will be asking how the tall keeper failed to claim the cross under pressure from the much shorter Baggies forward. Lee Cattermole (left) was involved in an altercation with James McClean The goal gave West Brom a jolt of confidence and Rondon had a shot deflected just wide after another fine cross from Brunt. But Sunderland began to boss proceedings in the final 20 minutes and Myhill nervously spilled a long range Yann M'Vila effort. Sessegnon then seemed to scythe down Jones in the box but he appeared to just about catch some of the ball and Atkinson was probably correct not to point to the spot. Costel Pantilimon and his Sunderland team mates could not believe the West Brom goal was allowed to stand Sunderland huffed and puffed in the closing stages but an equaliser never really looked imminent, their best late effort a Graham header which went well wide after a cross from fellow sub Adam Johnson. West Brom held on comfortably to secure a first home league win of the season and McClean celebrated in front of the visiting fans, before he had to be pulled away by Craig Gardner after being confronted by several Sunderland players. The Black Cats remain second from bottom of the table with just three points and Allardyce appears to have a huge job on his hands, while West Brom are up to a relatively comfortable 12th place.

scoring against Watford in the Premier League Three goals in a 12-minute second-half spell handed Arsenal a 3-0 win over Watford at Vicarage Road, sending them back to second place in the Premier League table. Alexis Sanchez opened the scoring on 62 minutes - his 10th goal in his last six games for club and country - after good work from Mesut Ozil and Santi Cazorla in a rapid Arsenal counter-attack. Germany international Ozil turned provider again four minutes later, cutting back for Olivier Giroud to double the Gunners' advantage. Sanchez celebrates with team-mates after scoring the first goal against Watford. Aaron Ramsey made it three on 74 minutes, guiding home via a deflection after a break from Hector Bellerin. The right-back surged into the box and set up Ramsey, who capped a brilliant week for Wales and Arsenal with his first goal of the Premier League season. The win sees the Gunners rise to second place, two points behind league leaders Manchester City, while Watford sit 14th with 10 points from their opening nine Premier League games. Ramsey squandered Arsenal's best chance of the first-half on 27 minutes, scooping over from four yards after a pinpoint cross from Sanchez.

Arsene Wenger was pleased with Arsenal’s relentlessness during 3-0 victory Arsene Wenger was pleased with Arsenal’s relentlessness during 3-0 victory Sanchez was bright throughout, testing Heurelho Gomes with a stinging 25-yard strike inside the first five minutes, but Etienne Capoue and Ben Watson were coping with Ozil's threat well in an even first 45 minutes. Both sides had opportunities as the half wore on, as first Troy Deeney broke clear only to let down Ighalo with a poor final ball, before Bellerin burst past Nathan Ake after linking-up with Ramsey, but the right-back failed to pick out an unmarked Monreal at the back post. Sanchez and Troy Deeney compete for the ball in the first-half at Vicarage Road Arsenal caught Watford on the counter several times in the second half, and the Hornets fell behind just after the hour mark. Capoue went down on the edge of the Gunners box with Watford committed forward, but the referee was unmoved and Arsenal broke through Cazorla and Ozil. The Germany midfielder skipped through and was upended in the Watford box by Ake, but Sanchez followed up to sweep past Gomes.

"Tempers flared in the first half at Goodison Park Romelu Lukaku equalised after Danny Ings opened the scoring as the Merseyside derby ended 1-1 at Goodison Park. Liverpool, who sacked Brendan Rodgers just hours after the final whistle, took the lead with four minutes remaining in the first half when Ings headed home unmarked from James Milner's inswinging corner. However, Liverpool were not ahead for long as Everton hit back through Lukaku, the Belgian taking full advantage of Emre Can's inability to clear a Gerard Deulofeu cross. The result leaves Everton a point ahead of Liverpool in the Premier League table and just three points off second place. Danny Ings heads Liverpool ahead unchallenged from a corner The game started at a frantic pace and rarely slowed during the first half. Liverpool were on top in the first 10 minutes and twice Everton needed to be alert to prevent an opening goal. First, Tim Howard rushed out to slide tackle Milner after the midfielder was played through by Daniel Sturridge down the inside left channel, before Martin Skrtel squared the ball for Sturridge who was only denied by Phil Jagielka's well-timed challenge. Everton manager Roberto Martinez was pleased with his side's performance after their 1-1 draw with Liverpool. Everton manager Roberto Martinez was pleased with his side's performance after their 1-1 draw with Liverpool. Ings hit a dipping half-volley from the edge of the box before the quarter-hour mark before Everton began to come back into the game. However, it was Liverpool who got in again as Philippe Coutinho scooped a lovely pass over the defence to Milner but his near-post effort from a tight angle was blocked by the legs of Howard. Soon afterwards, though, it was Howard's opposite number who was forced into action - Simon Mignolet denying first Steven Naismith, then James McCarthy with two excellent saves. Everton's Romelu Lukaku levels the score in first-half injury time The first came after Naismith got free of Mamadou Sakho and headed goalwards from eight yards only to be denied by a brilliant reaction stop by the Belgian 'keeper and less than two minutes later Mignolet flung himself to his right to push away McCarthy's powerful hit from the edge of the box. With Everton in the ascendancy, tempers flared just after the half-hour with Can and Ross Barkley squaring up to one another as the German refused to give the ball back for an Everton throw. Milner stepped in to hold back the centre-back just as things threatened to boil over and before long players from both sides had piled in. The result was a yellow card apiece for Can and Barkley. The latter fortunate not to be sent off having escaped a booking for kicking the ball away earlier in the game. The breakthrough came less than five minutes before the break with Ings left unmarked in the six yard box to nod a simple head past Howard from Milner's corner. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers was proud of his player's effort and positive attitude as they earned a 1-1 draw in the Merseyside derby. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers was proud of his player's effort and positive attitude as they earned a 1-1 draw in the Merseyside derby. Everton responded well, though, and kept Liverpool pegged in their own half for the next five minutes until they found their equaliser. In the end it came courtesy of a defensive error. Deulofeu's cross from the right was a good one but Can's clearance at the far post certainly was not. He hit it along the ground and into Skrtel. The ball then sat up perfectly for Lukaku to hammer it beyond Mignolet into the far corner. Liverpool's Mamadou Sakho (second left) and Everton's Romelu Lukaku (second right) clashed in the second half Everton remained buoyed by the goal even as the second half began and they got on the front foot early on. Tyias Browning saw his header deflected over the bar before Mignolet had to get down well to intercept Lukaku's low cross with Deulofeu waiting at the back post. The Toffees' front man was starting to cause real problems for Liverpool's centre-backs and he helped create the space for Aaron Lennon and Barkley to get in down the flanks and put in dangerous balls that Skrtel did well to clear. Barkley threatened again for Everton as he benefitted from some slack Liverpool passing to break through the centre of the pitch. He reached the edge of the box unchallenged but then curled his shot just wide of the post. Lukaku tested Mignolet with another shot from inside the box before Everton were left fuming after Lucas escaped a red card. The Brazilian had been booked earlier in the half for a foul on Barkley and, when he tripped McCarthy, a second booking seemed a formality. However, Martin Atkinson kept his cards in his pockets and Lucas escaped before being substituted soon afterwards. Coutinho then had a shot blocked by Barry as both sides pushed for a winner. Roberto Martinez (L) and Brendan Rodgers shared the spoils at Goodison Park There was still time one final flash point in the last minute. Sakho and Lukaku clashed inside the Liverpool box and had to be dragged apart by their team-mates with both seemingly intent on a heavyweight showdown. A yellow card each was the result and despite more Everton pressure late on it ended all square.

Alexis Sanchez (6) and Mesut Ozil (7) scored within 33 seconds before the Chilean belted a third to leave United three-down inside 20 minutes for the first time in the Premier League era. Petr Cech made a big stop from Anthony Martial right on half-time and United did improve after the break, but that was as much down to Arsenal re-evaluating their ambition as anything else, and three times counter-attacks almost brought a fourth goal. The result leaves Arsenal two points behind Manchester City, the margin of victory enough to take them above United into second place. Both managers had talked up the importance of the day in the build-up, Wenger calling it the season's \"first massive game\" and Louis Van Gaal suggesting three points would give his side the belief to mount a title challenge. Arsene Wenger talked up his Arsenal side in the build-up to the game and was not let down Few bought into Wenger's pre-match insistence that Arsenal can win this season's Premier League, but the Arsenal manager's apparently unyielding faith in his players proved justified as they produced a positive response to their latest Champions League chastening. The manager's message had clearly got across as his players rattled into United from the start: Sanchez tore terrifyingly at Matteo Darmian, Ozil demanded the ball and Gabriel unsuccessfully claimed a penalty as Bastian Schweinsteiger took an armful of his midriff from a corner. Graeme Souness and Thierry Henry assess Theo Walcott's impressive performance in Arsenal's 3-0 win over Manchester United Graeme Souness and Thierry Henry assess Theo Walcott's impressive performance in Arsenal's 3-0 win over Manchester United And there was a sense of the inevitable even so early in the game when Ozil got the byline and cut back a right-footed centre for Sanchez to flick the ball behind his standing leg and beyond a committed David De Gea. United had barely restarted when their pockets were picked again in midfield, Ozil shovelling a pass for Theo Walcott, who checked back and returned the favour for the German to side-foot a second. Just 33 seconds separated the goals. Mesut Ozil (centre) side-footed Arsenal's second goal barely 30 seconds after their first Underpinning Arsenal's start was the composure of Santi Cazorla, who dictated play from deep and even mucked in to get his full-backs out of a hole here and there as the half wore on. And then there was Sanchez. Arsenal switched from right to left in the blink of an eye, and last season's top scorer continued to put a sluggish couple of post-Copa America months behind him as he cut in to hammer a rising shot to De Gea's left. Six goals in three games say Sanchez is back. Aaron Ramsey should have had Arsenal out of sight only to volley off target, and when Martial spun Per Mertesacker to force a left-legged stop from Cech there was a palpable sense of nervousness among supporters who last season saw their side throw away a three-goal lead against Anderlecht. Anthony Martial (L) had the best of Manchester United's chances but was kept out by Petr Cech They need not have been so concerned. Van Gaal's introduction of Marouane Fellaini gave United midfield muscle, but Wenger responded by asking Aaron Ramsey to tuck in as his side kept their shape and relied on Mertesacker and Gabriel to defend their 18-yard line. Cech made a routine stop from Wayne Rooney and was allowed to make another by Schweinsteiger's poor touch, while at the other end Ozil and substitute Olivier Giroud swept first-time shots straight at De Gea.

Andre Ayew opened the scoring in south Wales on 16 minutes with a superb header, but Spurs drew level as Eriksen's 27th-minute free-kick wrong-footed Lukasz Fabianski. Harry Kane's unfortunate own goal then handed the initiative back to the Swans four minutes later, with the England striker slicing Jonjo Shelvey's corner beyond a helpless Hugo Lloris. The second half continued in the same fashion as the first as both sides readily exchanged blows, before Eriksen's sumptuous set-piece on 65 minutes levelled the game for the second time. Spurs headed into the game in buoyant mood having won their previous three Premier League outings - the latest a 4-1 triumph over Manchester City- but it was the hosts who took an early lead. Jefferson Montero, who was recalled to the Swansea starting line-up, vindicated his inclusion as he made the most of a defensive error by Kyle Walker to set up Ayew to head in his fourth goal of the season. Andre Ayew celebrates with team-mates after putting Swansea in the lead It was Swansea's first goal from open play since Bafetimbi Gomis' winner against Manchester United in August. But the hosts failed to build on their opener and Spurs were level within 11 minutes. After Federico Fernandez's foul on Dele Alli, Erisken's whipped effort caught Fabianski off-guard and sailed straight into the back of the net to level the game. Fabianski would have been disappointed with his part in the equaliser but Swansea were soon back in front. Kane's near-post clearance went horribly wrong on 31 minutes as he swiped at Shelvey's corner and beat Lloris at his near post to restore the hosts' lead. Ashley Williams celebrates after Harry Kane turns the ball beyond Lloris Kane looked to atone for his first-half error two minutes after the restart as his neat touch and control in the box allowed him to gather Ben Davies' cross, but Fabianski was on hand to deflect the ball away from goal. Montero, who had been a constant threat to Walker throughout the first half, continued in the same fashion after the break, but Gomis failed to make the most of his lofted ball to the back post, heading over on 48 minutes. A dip in tempo of the game from Swansea allowed Eriksen to draw his side level for the second time. There was no debate over Fabianski's involvement this time around as the Poland international was left helpless as Eriksen exquisitely found the top corner. Tottenham players congratulate Eriksen after his first free-kick at the Liberty Stadium Kane seemed reluctant to shoot at goal when opportunities presented themselves and Spurs had to turn to Alli, Eriksen and substitute Andros Townsend as they went in search of a third. They could not find a way through, though, with the hosts limiting Spurs to long-range efforts. And Swansea almost snatched the three points themselves as Fernandez saw a late header tipped onto the bar by Lloris. The result sees Swansea's winless run in all competitions extended to six games, although they rise to 11th in the table while Spurs remain eighth on 13 points.

The Eagles took all three points thanks to Yannick Bolasie's close-range header midway through the second half and a late Yohan Cabaye penalty. And the win moved Alan Pardew's side up to third place in the Premier League even after the afternoon fixtures, while West Brom boss Tony Pulis tasted defeat on his return to south-east London. Palace were still without the likes of Connor Wickham, Mile Jedinak, Damien Delaney and Joel Ward, while midfielder Joe Ledley was only named as a substitute. Meanwhile, the visitors were able to field the same lineup that began their recent league win at Aston Villa, meaning both Gareth McAuley and Salomon Rondon were passed fit, although Jonas Olsson's groin problem kept him out of the game. The Swede's absence at the back was then further compounded when centre-back Jonny Evans was forced off midway through the first half with a hamstring tweak, making the Northern Ireland international a doubt for his country's key European Championship qualifier at home to Greece on Thursday. However, it was down the left-hand side of the visitors' back line, rather than the centre, where Palace were creating most problems in the first half, with right-winger Zaha in particular causing opposite number Chris Brunt a headache with his pace and trickery. Yannick Bolasie puts Crystal Palace 1-0 up against West Brom in the 68th minute The England winger gave an early warning to West Brom after dragging a shot wide of Boaz Myhill's near post following one mazy dribble, before the 22-year-old turned Brunt inside out, only for Myhill to beat away his well-struck effort just past the half-hour mark. And Zaha produced a similar move four minutes before half-time, but again the Baggies' goalkeeper stood tall to repel the wide man's drive as the two teams went in level at the interval. West Brom's back four had looked well drilled in the opening 45 minutes, as one would expect from a team coached by Pulis and who had kept four clean sheets in the Premier League this season. Palace, though, would argue they should have been awarded a penalty after 36 minutes when Dwight Gayle was bundled over in the area following a clumsy challenge from Brunt. The home side were also shouting for a spot kick midway through the second half when substitute Craig Gardner - a half-time replacement for striker Saido Berahino - handled Cabaye's free kick in the area, but again referee Jonathan Moss waved away their protests. Yohan Cabaye makes it 2-0 from the penalty spot in the 89th minute to secure three points for Palace But Palace's disappointment was soon forgotten when Bolasie - fresh off the back of signing a new three-and-a-half-year deal at Selhurst Park - broke the deadlock after 68 minutes, the first time West Brom had let in a goal on their travels in the Premier League this campaign. Palace worked a corner short to Jason Puncheon, who then cleverly found Cabaye and the Frenchman's inch-perfect, curling cross from the left-hand edge of the area was headed in at the back post by Bolasie, the DR Congo winger's first goal in front of his own fans since January 2013. The points were wrapped up with two minutes to go when man-of-the-match Zaha's driving run into the area was ended by Brunt's foul, with Cabaye converting the resulting spot kick for his second penalty in a week. And with 60 per cent possession and 21 shots on goal in the match, Pardew's men were fully deserving of their victory.

"report": "Marko Arnautovic celebrates scoring the opener for Stoke at Villa Park Marko Arnautovic scored the only goal of the game for Stoke as Aston Villa slipped to their sixth defeat in eight games. The Austrian scored 10 minutes into the second half with a crisp low finish to leave Villa slumped in the relegation zone. Tim Sherwood's side pushed hard for an equaliser in the closing stages but the closer the clock ticked to 90 minutes, the less Villa looked like scoring. Aston Villa manager Tim Sherwood says his side didn't create enough chances in their Barclays Premier League defeat to Stoke Aston Villa manager Tim Sherwood says his side didn't create enough chances in their Barclays Premier League defeat to Stoke Stoke held on and for them it was a second successive win and their third in a row at Villa Park as they look to put their own poor start to the season behind them. The one down side for the Potters was an injury to Mame Biram Diouf late on that saw the forward stretchered off. Stoke were the quicker to settle in the first half and could have gone in front in the fourth minute when Diouf was played in by Jon Walters down the right. The forward got into the box but saw his shot well blocked by Micah Richards. The visitors stayed on the front foot for the opening 15 minutes before Villa, trying out a new 3-5-2 formation, started to grow into the game. Marko Arnautovic says Stoke are moving in the right direction again after his goal at Villa Park Marko Arnautovic says Stoke are moving in the right direction again after his goal at Villa Park However, the hosts almost fell behind when Charlie Adam tried his luck from well inside his own half. The midfielder saw Guzan off his line and made good contact only to be denied at the last second by the back peddling goalkeeper, who tipped the ball past the post. At the other end Villa struggled to get Rudy Gestede into the game after his double last weekend and had to remain wary of the threat posed by Arnautovic on the break. Indeed, the Stoke wide man thought he had put the Potters in front after one such counter-attack. He broke from deep before playing it out to Bojan. The diminutive former Barcelona man let the ball run across his body before whipping in a fantastic cross that Arnautovic poked home only to see the assistant with his flag raised as he wheeled away to celebrate. Tim Sherwood looks on during Villa's 1-0 defeat The replays showed it was the right decision although there was very little in it. Villa introduced Jack Grealish at half-time and ditched the back three but it was a similar story again in the second half, with Mark Hughes' men in the ascendancy early on. The difference this time was that they made their dominance count. It took 10 minutes and Bojan had already wasted a promising opening with a lax pass having been played in by Glen Johnson, but eventually the pressure told. Johnson was again the creator as he picked up the ball 35 yards from goal in the inside right position and fed a perfectly waited pass into Arnautovic, who took a touch before firing past Guzan and in off the post. Tim Sherwood will have been far from happy with his central defenders as Richards and Crespo left a vast gap between them that Arnautovic was simply allowed to run through. Stoke's Marko Arnautovic scores in the 55th minute to secure the away victory against Aston Villa The response from Villa was a good one and they could have been level within 60 seconds of the restart. A ball was floated nicely to the far post and Micah Richards was free to run onto it and head the ball goalwards. However, his radar was off and he managed to head the ball wide from six yards, much to the despair of the Holte End faithful. Jordan Ayew and Carles Gil were thrown on by Sherwood as he went in search of an equaliser. However, as the game wore on Stoke looked as likely to find a second on the counter as Villa did to level the scores. Gestede broke into the box and shot at Butland while Jordan Veretout's goalbound volley was cleared by Erik Pieters, but that was as good as it got for Villa. Stoke held on and move five points clear of their opponents, who remain in the relegation zone as the pressure mounts on Sherwood.

Murray, making his first start for the Cherries after his summer move from Crystal Palace, opened the scoring on 28 minutes, before Odion Ighalo tapped home for Watford following an Artur Boruc error. Murray had the chance to win the game from the penalty spot with seven minutes to play after Etienne Capoue brought down substitute Adam Smith, but the former Palace striker saw his effort saved by Heurelho Gomes. The draw means Watford move up to 11th in the table, while five points from their first four home games sees Bournemouth settle in 15th. Eddie Howe's side capitalised on a bright start to go ahead through Murray, the forward converting a perfect cross from Matt Ritchie after good link-up play down the right-hand side. It was the third time Murray found himself unmarked in the Watford penalty box inside the first 30 minutes - he miscued early on when well-placed before he was correctly flagged offside after a diving header drifted just wide, but the warning signs were there for Quique Sanchez Flores. Bournemouth's Glenn Murray celebrates scoring his side's first goal of the game The Cherries were comfortable after the goal as Watford struggled to sustain attacks, but a nightmarish mistake from Boruc gifted Watford a route back into the match on the stroke of half-time. The Bournemouth 'keeper took too long on the ball, and passed straight to Ighalo after the Watford striker closed him down. Ighalo calmly rounded Boruc and tapped into an empty net to level things up. The error brought to mind Boruc's mistake at Arsenal when he played for Southampton two years ago - on that occasion Oliver Giroud was the grateful beneficiary. Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe was left disappointed after his side drew 1-1 with Watford. Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe was left disappointed after his side drew 1-1 with Watford. After the break the game opened up, and Ben Watson rattled the crossbar for Watford with a half-volley from 10 yards on 51 minutes. The Hornets were much improved in the second half, with Ikechi Anya heavily involved after a quiet first 45 minutes. The winger had Watford's next chance just after the hour mark, but Boruc smothered well after the Scotland International got in behind the Bournemouth defence for the first time. Anya was forced off with a knock on 72 minutes, and Bournemouth rallied as both sides had chances to win the game. Bournemouth's Joshua King (left) and Watford's Nathan Ake battle for the ball Steve Cook saw his 20-yard bicycle kick brilliantly saved by Gomes, before referee Michael Oliver awarded the Cherries a penalty after Capoue took down Smith on 83 minutes. But Murray missed his opportunity to put Eddie Howe's side ahead, Gomes diving down to his left-hand side to comfortably keep out a penalty that lacked power. Bournemouth will feel like they missed a great chance to climb the table after controlling large parts of the game, and they face a tough run of fixtures after the international break. Next up is a visit to Manchester City before they welcome Tottenham Hotspur to the Vitality Stadium on October 25. As for Watford, they have stretched their impressive away league form to a run of just one defeat from their last 13 matches away from Vicarage Road (W8 D4). They host Arsenal on October 17, before a trip to the Britannia Stadium to face Stoke City. Soccer Saturday verdict - Paul Merson \"It was a disappointing game in the end. Watford were slow to support Deeney on the attack, and there weren't many chances from either side. \"One of the highlights was Steve Cook's bicycle kick, which required a great save from Gomes. Sanchez Flores will be the happier of the managers today. Bournemouth had to win today, and Watford set up not to lose.\" Quique Sanchez Flores was happy with Watford's display in their 1-1 draw with Bournemouth Quique Sanchez Flores was happy with Watford's

Manchester City as they came from behind to beat Newcastle United 6-1 at the Etihad Stadium. Newcastle took a shock lead after 18 minutes through Aleksandar Mitrovic's header, before Aguero levelled things up three minutes before half-time from close range. Aguero put City 3-1 up after the break with two goals in two minutes, before Kevin De Bruyne's deft finish put the hosts out of reach. Aguero reacts after scoring Manchester City's equaliser The unstoppable Aguero added a fourth for himself and a fifth for City on the hour mark, and then another from De Bruyne's cross on 62 minutes, completing an incredible 23-minute spell to put his side 6-1 up against a shell-shocked Newcastle. Aguero is only the fifth player to achieve a five-goal haul in a Premier League game after Andrew Cole, Alan Shearer, Jermain Defoe and Dimitar Berbatov. The win returns City to the top of the Premier League, while Newcastle manager Steve McClaren remains without a league win after eight games. Aguero celebrates his fourth for City in the second half City were coming off the back of an important win at Borussia Monchengladbach in the Champions League on Wednesday, but showed signs of tiredness in a first half that belonged to Newcastle. Mitrovic netted his first goal for Newcastle early on, getting on the end of Giorginio Wijnaldum's deft cross to head into the bottom left corner from 10 yards. Newcastle then had two fine chances to double their lead in quick succession, both falling to Mitrovic. The Argentine had scored just one league goal this season before Saturday First, the Serb's free header from Vurnon Anita's deep cross went over the bar, before Joe Hart brilliantly thwarted him after being played through one-on-one by Moussa Sissoko. City got into their flow late in the first half, Aguero coming close to levelling after driving a left-footed effort just wide of Tim Krul's goal from the edge of the box, but the Argentine did get his first on 42 minutes. After a corner broke to the edge of the box, Silva's superb lofted ball over the top of the defence found Fernandinho at the far post, and after a deft touch across the six-yard box, Aguero finished off with a close-range header. Aleksandar Mitrovic (second left) of Newcastle United celebrates scoring his team's opening goal There was an element of fortune to Aguero's second on 49 minutes, seeing his shot from the edge of the area deflect off Yoan Gouffran and wrong-foot Tim Krul, but his hat-trick goal a minute later was more trademark, chipping over the Newcastle goalkeeper after De Bruyne had found him through on goal. It was 4-1 three minutes later, De Bruyne going from provider to goalscorer by volleying home at the far post from substitute Jesus Navas' cross. Aguero, who had only scored once in the league this season before Saturday, curled an 18-yard effort into the bottom right corner having made a yard of space for himself to put City 5-1 up, and he completed the rout two minutes later. Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini looks on as his side return to form De Bruyne caught Newcastle's sleepy defence napping with a low pass across the face of the goal for Aguero to simply convert from close range. But City manager Manuel Pellegrini denied Aguero the opportunity to become the first player to score a double hat-trick in the Premier League, taking the 27-year-old off moments later for Wilfried Bony. Newcastle settled in the final stages to keep the score down, substitute Kelechi Iheanacho going closest after forcing Krul into a good save inside the penalty area. Pellegrini was full of praise for his Manchester City side following their 6-1 win against Newcastle Pellegrini was full of praise for his Manchester City side following their 6-1 win against Newcastle Charlie Nicholas' verdict on Soccer Saturday At half time it could have been 4-1 to Newcastle. Manchester City were completely unbalanced in the first half an hour, but moving De Bruyne to the right changed the game. There are always turning points and if you don't score your chances, and the Mitrovic chance before half time was that point. I've never seen such a dramatic turn from a team. Four goals in seven minutes is incredible. Some great finishing, but Newcastle were terrible at the back today. This defence is not right, and something needs to change. City got out of a mess today, and yet it ends up so emphatic. Kevin De Bruyne was happy with his performance as he played a pivotal role in City's 6-1 win against Newcastle Kevin De Bruyne was happy with his performance as he played a pivotal role in City's 6-1 win against Newcastle Player ratings Man City: Hart (6), Zabaleta (7), Otamendi (6), Mangala (6), Kolarov (8), Fernando (7), Fernandinho (7), Silva (8), Sterling (5), De Bruyne (9), Aguero (10) Subs: Navas (7), Bony (6), Iheanacho (6) Newcastle: Krul (4), Janmaat (5), Mbemba (4), Coloccini (4), Mbabu (3);

Red-hot Jamie Vardy scored in his fifth consecutive Premier League game as Leicester claimed a 2-1 victory over Norwich at Carrow Road. The England forward opened the scoring from the penalty spot just before the half-hour mark after he was brought down in the box by Sebastien Bassong. Jeffrey Schlupp doubled the Foxes' lead soon after the break with a cool finish after a scintillating break up the field which he began himself. Substitute Dieumerci Mbokani gave Norwich hope when he pulled one back in the 68th minute but the home side could not find an equaliser despite sustained pressure on the Leicester goal late on. Claudio Ranieri was happy to see his side respond to last week's defeat with a 2-1 away win against Norwich. Claudio Ranieri was happy to see his side respond to last week's defeat with a 2-1 away win against Norwich. The game began in cautious fashion as both teams felt each other out with half chances for Cameron Jerome and Shinji Okazaki the closest either side came to crafting an opening in the first 20 minutes. Claudio Ranieri surprisingly elected to drop in-form Riyad Mahrez for the game with Schlupp pushed forward into midfield and Christian Fuchs starting at left-back. The move paid off as Schlupp proved a constant threat with Leicester's energetic high pressing - led from the front by Vardy - causing problems for Norwich. Leicester came close to taking the lead on 25 minutes when Schlupp burst past two Norwich defenders into the box but Russell Martin produced a wonderful diving tackle to block his goal-bound shot. Danny Drinkwater and Jeffrey Schlupp fought hard to grind out a 2-1 away win against Norwich and highlighted it as an important result Danny Drinkwater and Jeffrey Schlupp fought hard to grind out a 2-1 away win against Norwich and highlighted it as an important result The visitors soon crafted another good opportunity when Fuchs sent a long throw into the box which was flicked on by Vardy at the near post. Marc Albrighton looked certain to poke home from close range but failed to connect with goal gaping and John Ruddy then did well to deny Danny Drinkwater's follow-up shot. However Leicester were rewarded for their pressure immediately afterwards when the ball was played through for Vardy and he got his body between the ball and Bassong, drawing a foul from the Norwich centre-back, which Mark Clattenburg punished by pointing to the spot. Vardy converted for his seventh league goal of the season. The goal prompted Norwich to push further forward in search of an equaliser but Leicester looked menacing on the counter attack and almost doubled their lead just before half-time when Vardy sent in a dangerous cross which Alexander Tettey just manged to head clear with Okazaki luking. Jeff Schlupp of Leicester City celebrates scoring his team's second goal against Norwich City. Leicester did double their lead soon after half-time. Schlupp picked the ball up deep in his own half as Norwich turned over possession. He drove quickly up the pitch and played a one-two N'Golo Kante before coolly slotting the ball past Ruddy. Alex Neil immediately sent Nathan Redmond as he sought to give his side a spark but they struggled to craft clear-cut scoring opportunities despite a succession of corners. Mbokani was introduced just before the hour mark and the DR Congo striker immediately made an impact when he sent a header cannoning off Kasper Schmeichel's crossbar. Dieumerci Mbokani pulls one back for Norwich in the 68th minute - but the Canaries fail to pull the game level. Mbokani gave Norwich a lifeline with his first ever Premier League goal soon after when he deftly flicked Jonny Howson's floated cross into the net. Leicester substitute Leonardo Ulloa thought he had restored the visitors two-goal lead when he nodded home but Clattenburg spotted a push on Cameron Jerome in the build-up and the goal was disallowed. As the game entered its stages a fourth goal looked likely with Norwich laying siege to the Leicester goal and Vardy providing a constant threat on the break at the other end. Schmeichel produced a wonderful save to touch Redmond's fierce drive from a narrow angle onto the post two minutes from time. There was a dramatic finale as the fourth official signalled six minutes of added time and both teams had chances to score. The best chance fell to Redmond at the death when the ball fell to him in the box but Danny Drinkwater hurled himself in front of his shot which seemed destined for the back of the net and Leicester held on for all three points. Soccer Saturday verdict - Phil Thompson \"This is a big win, and Leicester were excellent. Norwich began a passing game but Leicester pressed, working themselves into the game. As for the penalty, we've seen the same move from Vardy before. The Leicester striker throws himself into Bassong, and Clattenburg points to the spot, exactly the same as he did against Manchester United a few weeks ago. \"Vardy is on fire at the moment, and should be given a chance for England in the next couple of weeks. Schlupp added the pace that Mahrez would usually offer, and he was excellent. He starts the move for his goal, great movement, and he's got a fantastic left foot, driving it past Ruddy. Norwich made a great fist of the comeback, but it wasn't to be for them today.\" Player ratings Norwich: Ruddy (6), Whittaker (5), Martin (6), Bassong (5), Brady (6), Howson (6), Tettey (7), Dorrans

lead as they drew 2-2 with West Ham in what could be Dick Advocaat's final game in charge. Uncertainty over the manager's future did not prevent the home side taking a 2-0 lead, with excellent goals from Steven Fletcher (10) and Jeremain Lens (22) scant reward for their early verve. Had Fabio Borini then taken a one-on-one chance a first Premier League win of the season would surely have been in the bag, but Carl Jenkinson halved the deficit right on half-time and Dimitri Payet equalised (60) two minutes after Lens was shown a red card. Amid the drama of a sending-off, a surrendered lead and a manager supposedly on the brink, it should not be overlooked that Sunderland became the first team this season to deny West Ham an away win. Fabio Borini misses a chance to score a third with Sunderland leading 2-0 in the first half In doing so they prevented Slaven Bilic breaking new ground as the first Hammers boss in the Premier League era to win four straight on the road, but the Croat will know his side could easily have made the trip back south with nothing at all. If the rumours about Advocaat swirling around Wearside were designed to bring a response from his players, then it worked big-time as their early ploy of sitting off the visitors gave way to an attacking first-half performance of real menace. Fletcher's opener was the catalyst; the Scot peeling off to the penalty spot to sweep in Yann M'Vila's training-ground free-kick as John O'Shea made mischief with West Ham's muddled markers. Jeremain Lens is shown a red card two minutes before Payet's second-half equaliser Better, implausibly, was to come, with Payet's poor pass forcing a rushed clearance from Winston Reid and again M'Vila capitalised, sliding through Lens for a beautiful first-time chip which beat Adrian and found the net via the crossbar. The goalkeeper's one-handed stop kept out O'Shea's header, but he was committed minutes later as Fletcher's flick sent Borini in on goal. The Italian picked his spot: sadly for Sunderland it was a foot outside the post. Still they should have gone in with a two-goal lead, but three defenders failed to prevent Victor Moses delivering a left-wing cross, and Jenkinson careered up from right-back to fire a first West Ham goal. Dick Advocaat believes Sunderland deserved more than the 2-2 draw against West Ham. Dick Advocaat believes Sunderland deserved more than the 2-2 draw against West Ham. The nerves among the home fans were obvious, and with good reason: referee Neil Swarbrick was officious all afternoon in dishing out eight yellow cards, but Lens' hack at Reid more than merited the second yellow that came his way. And any hope of a rearguard action went by the wayside within a couple of minutes as Costel Pantilimon spilled Manuel Lanzini's shot straight to a grateful Payet, who gobbled up a fourth Premier League goal. A home defeat seemed almost inevitable at that point, but Sunderland regrouped admirably and held out comfortably but for one Lanzini shot that missed by a whisker. West Ham boss Slaven Bilic is happy with his teams positive performance, after a difficult first half, against Sunderland. West Ham boss Slaven Bilic is happy with his teams positive performance, after a difficult first half, against Sunderland. Soccer Saturday verdict - Matt Le Tissier \"For the first time this season, I thought Sunderland could stay in the Premier League. They got the early goal which gave them a great boost of confidence. The turning point came when Borini had the chance to put Sunderland 3-0 up. It was inches wide and it should have been game over. \"West Ham got a goal before half-time and the momentum swung when Lens was sent off for Sunderland. Pantilimon was at fault for the second goal, but Sunderland showed a lot of character to hold on for the point.\" Carl Jenkinson thinks his goal just before half-time against Sunderland was a crucial moment as West Ham came back to draw 2-2.

"Graziano Pelle stuns Stamford Bridge with Southampton's third goal Chelsea's miserable form continued as Southampton came from behind to claim a deserved 3-1 victory over the champions on Saturday Night Football. After falling behind to Willian's exquisite free kick on 10 minutes, Southampton produced a stunning comeback as goals from Steven Davis, Sadio Mane and Graziano Pelle sealed a first league victory at Stamford Bridge since January 2002. The results leaves Jose Mourinho's men languishing in 16th place, 10 points adrift of Manchester City, who returned to the top of the Premier League with an emphatic 6-1 victory over Newcastle earlier on Saturday. After clamouring among Chelsea fans, John Terry was reinstated into the starting line-up following his omission from their Champions League defeat at Porto. Jose Mourinho says referees are afraid to give decisions in Chelsea's favour and stated he's the best manager Chelsea has ever had Jose Mourinho says referees are afraid to give decisions in Chelsea's favour and stated he's the best manager Chelsea has ever had Eden Hazard, Oscar and Radamel Falcao, in place of the suspended Diego Costa, completed four changes for Mourinho's side, and the changes had the desired effect as the defending champions took an early lead. Having scored in the three games prior, Willian notched his fourth goal on the bounce with a sumptuous free kick, looping a curling effort over Maarten Stekelenburg from wide on the right that cannoned in off the post. Willian celebrated his fourth goal in his last four games. Chelsea appeared to bask in the brilliance of the Brazilian's effort as they failed to build on their opener and Southampton began to grow into the game. Southampton had two substantial claims for a penalty waved away by referee Robert Madley in the first half. First, Virgil van Dijk was tugged back by Branislav Ivanovic before Sadio Mane was clearly brought to ground by Ramires just after the half hour mark. To rub salt in the wound, Mane was booked for simulation following a tackle by Ivanovic in the aftermath. Steven Davis beats Asmir Begovic from outside the box to level the score before the break. But the visitors were not to be denied and they drew level on 44 minutes as Pelle's skilful chest down set up Davis to rattle home the equaliser with a forceful volley. The visitors took the initiative after the break and should have been in front when Mane was denied only by a smothering save from Asmir Begovic three minutes in. Jamie Redknapp and Gus Poyet examine the penalty incidents at Stamford Bridge Jamie Redknapp and Gus Poyet examine the penalty incidents at Stamford Bridge Chelsea then had a strong claim for penalty turned themselves as Falcao went down after a tangle with Stekelenburg. There was clear contact but replays suggested the Colombian was on his way to ground beforehand. And within three minutes Southampton had the lead. Sadio Mane puts the Saints 2-1 up at Stamford Bridge Tadic's inside pass was misread by Terry and allowed Mane through on goal, where he made no mistake in slotting the ball under the on-rushing Begovic. The inclusion of Pedro did little to prevent a rampant Southampton side from getting their third on 72 minutes. Hazard's mis-hit pass handed possession to the Saints, who broke though Mane. The Senegal international slipped Pelle in on the right and he hammered the ball beyond Begovic. John Terry's return failed to guide Chelsea back on the winning path Half-time substitute Nemanja Matic was then hooked directly after the goal, with Loic Remy entering the fray as Chelsea tried to get back into proceedings. But a comeback failed to materialise as Chelsea were condemned to their worst league start since 37 years ago, the season where they were relegated from the old First Division.

West Brom are 15th in the table while the Toffees move to fifth in what represents a substantial confidence boost ahead of Sunday's Merseyside derby against Liverpool. Lukaku says his first goal made all the difference and he knew Everton could fight back Lukaku says his first goal made all the difference and he knew Everton could fight back There were few signs of the fireworks to come during a poor first half in which Berahino's well-taken goal was the only real moment of quality. Both teams were neat and tidy on the ball but cautious with it and the result was a sterile 45 minutes with almost no goalmouth action. Saido Berahino beats Everton goalkeeper Tim Howard for West Brom's opener A poor - and uncharacteristic - miss by Ross Barkley summed up the nature of the contest but the second period of play could not have been more different. The Baggies took control of the game when Dawson firmly headed home a corner for his first goal of the season and to establish a two-goal lead for the home side. Tony Pulis felt West Brom had the game in their own hands and then gave it to Everton with some bad defending Tony Pulis felt West Brom had the game in their own hands and then gave it to Everton with some bad defending But Lukaku pulled one back less than a minute later, looping in a header from an inviting cross from a deep position by Gerard Deulofeu. The tone of the match duly changed, Lukaku then turned provider, collecting the ball on the right wing and dribbling in front of the home defence before passing through to Kone, who took his time before guiding a shot past Boaz Myhill's right hand. Lukaku turns the ball home from close range to complete Everton's fightback Nine minutes later, the Belgian striker completed Everton's comeback and an excellent night for himself with the winning goal. Lukaku was perhaps fortunate not to be punished after the ball rebounded off his thigh and onto his forearm as he controlled Deulofeu's cross before thrashing it in from inside the six-yard box. Roberto Martinez says his Everton players had to dig deep after a poor first half performance and never gave up Roberto Martinez says his Everton players had to dig deep after a poor first half performance and never gave up When he scored against his former club at the Hawthorns last season, the striker looked almost sorry to do so but there was nothing apologetic about his reaction to this goal, a backflip and somersault in front of the ecstatic away supporters. Five minutes later he was substituted off, to a standing ovation from his own fans and warm applause from the Baggies faithful too. It was no less than he deserved.

It took until the 71st minute for the deadlock to be broken, when Cabaye rifled home from the spot after substitute Wilfried Zaha was brought down just inside the penalty area by Allan Nyom. Watford - beaten at home for the first time this season - enjoyed plenty of possession during a match where chances were few and far between, a Jose Jurado free-kick that hit the crossbar just after the break their best opportunity.

But 11 minutes later, they had the lead thanks to Cabaye's second goal of the season and, despite a late Watford onslaught, Alan Pardew's men held on for a third away win of the season following two straight league defeats.

The defender thought he had opened the scoring, but Gomes did brilliantly to keep out the header from point-blank range. In a game of very few clear-cut chances, Watford looked dangerous on the counter-attack through the pace of Ikechi Anya and Almen Abdi and the powerful front two of Odion Ighalo and Troy Deeney. Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew was buoyed by his team's performance at Watford Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew was buoyed by his team's performance at Watford The hosts had one final chance before the break when Ighalo won a free-kick right on the edge of the box after tangling with Hangeland. Abdi struck the ball goalwards but he could not get it over the wall as the first 45 minutes came to a close. Despite having plenty of possession, it was not until after the interval that Quique Sanchez Flores' Watford side came close to getting on the scoresheet when, after Abdi had been tripped by Joe Ledley, Jurado stepped up in a similar position to before the break and hit a 25-yard free-kick that came back off the crossbar with Wayne Hennessey beaten. Etienne Capoue (left) and Yannick Bolasie clash during the Vicarage Road encounter Watford were on the attack again in the 55th minute when Craig Cathcart's long ball found Deeney. The striker chested it into the path of Ighalo, who laid the ball off to Abdi, whose driven shot was well saved by Palace 'keeper Hennessey. Eagles boss Pardew introduced Zaha from the bench as he tried to stem the flow of Watford pressure and the winger was soon involved, beating Nyom with his pace before being tripped by the right-back right on the edge of the Watford box. Much to the bemusement of the home fans, referee Anthony Taylor pointed to the spot but he looked to have made the correct decision as Cabaye stepped up to put the visitors ahead. Watford manager Quique Sánchez Flores described Crystal Palace being awarded a penalty as 'weak' following his side's 1-0 defeat Watford manager Quique Sánchez Flores described Crystal Palace being awarded a penalty as 'weak' following his side's 1-0 defeat Gayle, who scored a midweek hat-trick against Charlton in the Capital One Cup, should have wrapped up the points with a little over 10 minutes remaining but he could only poke wide from close-range following Yannick Bolasie's knock-down from Zaha's cross. Just minutes later, Gayle came close again after staying onside and breaking clear to latch onto Bolasie's pass but, after wriggling free in the box, he arrowed a shot just wide before being replaced by Fraizer Campbell. Watford rallied at the death in search of a point but Ledley's brave block from Jurado's driven attempt summed up their afternoon and, after conceding at home for the first time since their Premier League return, they could not find an equaliser to take a share of the spoils.

5-2 win at Leicester Alexis Sanchez broke his goalscoring drought with a hat-trick as Arsenal won 5-2 at the King Power Stadium to end Leicester's unbeaten start to the season. The Chilean had gone eight games without a goal, but Arsene Wenger predicted an upturn in fortunes before kick-off and Sanchez obliged big-time, helping Arsenal come from behind to win a breathless game and move above their hosts into fourth. In the process Wenger's side doubled their tally of Premier League goals, and new leaders Manchester United - next week's visitors to the Emirates - are just three points ahead. Theo Walcott says Arsenal played with patience and freedom Theo Walcott says Arsenal played with patience and freedom Jamie Vardy's opener (11) was quickly answered by Theo Walcott (18), and Sanchez (33) sent his side into the break ahead before adding two more (57 & 81)as Arsenal pulled away. Vardy (89) and substitute Olivier Giroud (90) then exchanged late strikes on an afternoon when Leicester's gung-ho style finally met its match and more. Claudio Ranieri's 'Tinkerman' moniker has stuck fast, but he sent his side out with two men up top and the same up-and-at-em approach which has made his side so thrilling to watch so far this season. Jamie Vardy celebrates putting Leicester ahead with the first of his two goals And Vardy had already scuffed against a post by the time he cut in from the left to bend his side in front, the goal coming seconds after Arsenal had been caught overmanned in the Leicester box. The sight of big Wes Morgan losing World Cup winner Mesut Ozil with a drop of the shoulder deep in his own half summed up City's spirit of adventure, and Vardy was close to a second when he headed Marc Albrighton's cross onto the top of the crossbar. Claudio Ranieri admits he was worried by Arsenal's strength on the counter-attack but the Leicester boss was still proud of his side's efforts Claudio Ranieri admits he was worried by Arsenal's strength on the counter-attack but the Leicester boss was still proud of his side's efforts A gameplan of relentless pressing and high-line defending always looked risky with Walcott about, though, and the England forward had already called Kasper Schmeichel into action by the time he equalised seconds after Vardy's near miss. An early Sanchez pass released Cazorla to shovel the ball on for Walcott, who seemed to have overrun it before finding the far corner with a precise left-footer across Schmeichel. Theo Walcott answered Vardy's opening goal and was a threat all afternoon Walcott was on the premises again when Arsenal went ahead 15 minutes later, attacking a Hector Bellerin centre which squirmed through to give Sanchez a tap-in, and only a couple last-ditch Ritchie De Laet tackles denied him further one-on-ones late in the half. It was all too much for Ranieri, who sacrificed Shinji Okazaki's nuisance value, bulked up his midfield with Andy King and asked his defence to drop deeper to negate Walcott's pace. Reaction from Jamie Vardy, who scored twice for Leicester but ended up on the losing side Reaction from Jamie Vardy, who scored twice for Leicester but ended up on the losing side The move backfired as Leicester's threat diminished while Walcott showed glimpses of a genuine centre-forward's nous as he continued to find space even with none in behind. Three times he came close to teeing up Sanchez before Ozil showed him the way, the German's dink leaving Schmeichel punching thin air as Sanchez headed into the empty net. But Sanchez will take the headlines after completing a hat-trick in the second half Ranieri reverted to two strikers as he brought on Leo Ulloa, and Arsenal in turn reverted to a counter-attacking mindset, churning out half-chances by the half-dozen on the break before Sanchez settled the argument from 20 yards. Leicester continued to engage slug-for-slug, Petr Cech coming to the visitors' rescue on three occasions before Vardy beat him with a finish identical to his first, but it was Giroud who had the final word as he swept in Nacho Monreal's pass first-time. Phil Thompson's Soccer Saturday verdict \"It was Alexis Sanchez's day, absolutely superb - back to his best. Harrying people, he gets three goals on the run - he was absolutely magnificent but so was [Santi] Cazorla and so was [Theo] Walcott. \"It was just great to watch it, both teams going for it. Both teams were worried about pace, but Riyad Mahrez was actually very quiet today. \"[Arsenal] were the better team, they could've had more as shown by the amount of chances but there was great football in between it; maybe you could say they were a bit open at the back but it was Arsenal back to their best. A game game though; praise for both sides.\" Arsene Wenger says he always felt the goals were coming and hopes the win gives Arsenal a confidence boost Arsene Wenger says he always felt the goals were coming and hopes the win gives Arsenal a confidence boost Player ratings Arsenal: Cech (7), Bellerin (6), Mertesacker (6), Koscielny (7), Monreal (7), Flamini (6), Cazorla (7), Ramsey (7), Ozil (7), Sanchez (8), Walcott (8).

Sturridge, making his second appearance after hip surgery, found the net twice in the second half after James Milner had given the home side the lead in the second minute. But a brace from Rudy Gestede meant Villa were right in the game throughout and ensured a tense finale for the home manager and supporters alike. Lucas says Liverpool came out on top in an extremely exciting game and insists his side's teamwork was evident throughout Lucas says Liverpool came out on top in an extremely exciting game and insists his side's teamwork was evident throughout Liverpool had got off to the perfect start as Milner gave them the lead after 66 seconds, collecting a pass from Coutinho on the edge of the box with one touch and finding the bottom corner with his second to lift the tension at Anfield. The hosts remained on top for much of the first half with Coutinho pulling the strings in midfield and Alberto Moreno, in particular, a threat down the left. James Milner handed Liverpool the lead Danny Ings also looked sharp after two goals in his previous two games and tested Guzan with a shot from just outside the box before curling another over the bar moments later. However, Villa should have been level after a counter-attack ended with Alan Hutton's cross only being cleared to Rudy Gestede by Emre Can. The striker took the shot first time but sliced it wide from just inside the box. The pattern of play returned to the norm with Liverpool pushing forward without creating any further chances of note and the visitors struggling to get out of their half before Villa went close again from another break. Rudy Gestede says he was disappointed not to get at least a point after scoring two goals at Anfield but insists Villa will bounce back Rudy Gestede says he was disappointed not to get at least a point after scoring two goals at Anfield but insists Villa will bounce back It was Hutton down the right who again provided the cross after Mamadou Sakho had tackled Jack Grealish. Simon Mignolet punched it half clear but Ashley Westwood was on the edge of the box and it took a block from Martin Skrtel to deny him an equaliser. That was how it stayed until the break and it seemed as if little had changed once play restarted. The home side stayed on the front foot with Villa happy to sit deep and counter when possible. Nathaniel Clyne very nearly doubled Liverpool's lead soon after the interval after Milner's well-struck shot was parried into his path by Guzan. However, Jordan Amavi threw himself in front of the shot to prevent a certain goal. Daniel Sturridge scored his second of the day against Villa Liverpool's were not to be denied though and they gave themselves a two-goal cushion just before the hour mark. The ball came in to Milner on the edge of the box and he flicked it with the outside of his foot into the path of Sturridge who took the volley on first time, finding the far corner with unerring accuracy (59). If that brought relief to the home fans, tension abounded again six minutes later when Gestede stabbed home unmarked from Hutton's cross. Tim Sherwood says to score twice at Anfield but still come away with no points is extremely disappointing for Villa Tim Sherwood says to score twice at Anfield but still come away with no points is extremely disappointing for Villa Given their recent form, few would have been surprised had the hosts wilted at this point. Instead though, they pressed forward again to score their third less than a minute later. Sturridge was again the goalscorer, picking up the ball on the left corner of the area and playing a one-two with Coutinho before rolling the ball into the bottom corner with his right foot. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers says his players worked tirelessly Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers says his players worked tirelessly It was the kind of calm, clinical finishing that Liverpool have so missed in his absence. Tim Sherwood's men refused to accept they were beaten though and were back within a goal of their hosts just four minutes later. Amavi put in a hanging cross from the left and Gestede attacked it before rising above Sakho to bullet an unstoppable header past Mignolet. Rudy Gestede celebrates his second goal for Villa against Liverpool at Anfield After four goals in 12 frenetic second-half minutes, Liverpool went about trying to take some time out of the game, slowing the tempo and gradually reasserting their authority on proceedings. With Villa now adopting a more adventurous approach, the chances were there for Liverpool to add a fourth. The best of these came after a quick passing move with Ings playing in Sturridge who was denied a hat-trick as his right foot shot was tipped round the post by Guzan. Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge scores his team's second goal, his first since returning from injury Micah Richards headed just over from a free-kick at the other end while Coutinho and Ings had chances to seal the three points for Rodgers' side. However, Liverpool survived what could have been a very edgy last few minutes relatively comfortably to hold on and take three much-needed points. Charlie Nicholas's Soccer Saturday verdict \"It was the quickness of mind, of feet, from Daniel Sturridge but it was worth waiting for because he could've scored five today. \"To score in the first minute, over 60 seconds, is awful for Aston Villa but such a good pick-me-up for Liverpool. It was [James] Milner, picked in a nice spot, nice control, no pressure on him and drills it in. You thought, surely that would ease the tension? \"It started to ease off a little, but the crosses started coming in and you could see the panic in with the back three. \"Ings could've scored two, Sturridge could've scored five, Guzan had some very good saves and in the end it was three points which was extremely well earned and well needed.

The game was slow to get going as neither side created many openings, but United were comfortable in possession. Memphis Depay is congratulated after opener David de Gea was the first goalkeeper called into action, keeping out a fierce Fabio Borini drive with his legs as the visitors pressed. However, in first-half stoppage time United found that killer pass, and got themselves in front. John O'Shea believes his Sunderland side were unfortunate to lose 3-0 and addresses their unsuccessful game-plan John O'Shea believes his Sunderland side were unfortunate to lose 3-0 and addresses their unsuccessful game-plan Daley Blind showed great vision to pick out Juan Mata over the top of the Sunderland defence, who then delightfully played the ball across into the path of Memphis, who beat Billy Jones to the ball to tap in his first Premier League goal. Memphis in action with Lee Cattermole at Old Trafford Then, less than a minute into the second-half, Old Trafford breathed a huge sigh of relief as their captain finally found his scoring boots. This was all about Anthony Martial. The French forward used his pace and power to get to the byline, fired the ball across goal, and Rooney managed to bundle the ball home - albeit scruffily - via his knee. Louis van Gaal was delighted to see United complete a comfortable 3-0 win against Sunderland Louis van Gaal was delighted to see United complete a comfortable 3-0 win against Sunderland Sunderland had a great chance to get back in it, but De Gea stood tall and blocked Patrick van Aanholt's strike to keep United in a comfortable position. Mata brought the best out of Costel Pantilimon from the edge of the box but he was more clinical in stoppage-time to make sure of the three points for United. Cattermole and Rooney clash early on Ashley Young got himself one-on-one with Jones, beat him to the byline and whipped the ball into Mata, who killed the ball brilliantly with one touch, before firing into the roof of the net. United may not have been overly convincing but this victory was one to remind rivals of their credentials as title contenders. Dick Advocaat was disappointed to see Sunderland lose 3-0 and believes conceding just before half-time was a catalyst Dick Advocaat was disappointed to see Sunderland lose 3-0 and believes conceding just before half-time was a catalyst Matt Le Tissier's Soccer Saturday verdict \"It is not the scintillating stuff we've seen [United] play down the years; it's fairly functional but it's working, so you can't criticise that. \"They did alright defensively. [Chris] Smalling was outstanding. Everything he did was tidy, even when he got put in positions where he was one-on-one he came out with the ball so I thought he was excellent. \"There wasn't a great deal to be enthused about [Sunderland], they weren't really that threatening, didn't have any long periods of sustained possession, they gave the ball away cheaply at times.

Goals from Virgil van Dijk - his first for Saints - a Ki Sung-Yueng own goal and Sadio Mane's third in a week put Ronald Koeman's side three ahead after 61 minutes. Gylfi Sigurdsson pulled one back for Swansea from the penalty spot with seven minutes to play after Jose Fonte brought down Neil Taylor. Virgil van Dijk was delighted to score his first goal for Southampton in their 3-1 home win against Swansea Virgil van Dijk was delighted to score his first goal for Southampton in their 3-1 home win against Swansea But it was too late for Garry Monk's side to mount a comeback, and Southampton now leapfrog their opponents in the table, climbing to ninth, while Swansea fall to 11th. Saints settled the quicker and took the lead through Van Dijk on 11 minutes, the Dutchman towering over former-Saints man Jack Cork to head past Lukasz Fabianski. Before that, Mane had wasted a good chance for Southampton, and Swans midfielder Ki smashed over the bar when well-placed following a long-range effort from Jonjo Shelvey. Lukasz Fabianski makes a save with Southampton forward Sadio Mane waiting to pounce Following Van Dijk's opener, Southampton sat back, allowing Swansea, and Shelvey in particular, plenty of time to pick passes from midfield. Sigurdsson failed to capitalise on a free-kick in excellent position midway through the first half, but as the two sides approached the interval, the chances dried up. With his side 1-0 down, Monk took action at the break, bringing on Eder and Jefferson Montero for Bafetimbi Gomis and Cork. Ronald Koeman was happy to see Southampton beat Swansea, a win which he highlights as important in putting together a run of results Ronald Koeman was happy to see Southampton beat Swansea, a win which he highlights as important in putting together a run of results But before either had the chance to make an impression, Southampton had doubled their lead. The impressive Pelle was causing Ashley Williams and Federico Fernandez problems, and the Italian played Tadic into the left channel on 54 minutes. The Serb crossed towards the waiting Mane, only for Ki to divert past his own goalkeeper. Just past the hour mark, Southampton made it three, Mane expertly finding the bottom corner of Fabianski's net (61) after good build-up from Pelle and Bertrand. Gylfi Sigurdsson was disappointed with Swansea's loss and hopes the team can turn around their poor run of form Gylfi Sigurdsson was disappointed with Swansea's loss and hopes the team can turn around their poor run of form The left-back, returning to make his first start of the Premier League season after a knee injury, was an attacking threat throughout. Swansea rallied in the closing stages and Shelvey had a goal-bound effort blocked by Fonte, before Southampton's Portugal international clumsily tripped Taylor in the box, gifting the Swans a route back into the match with seven minutes to play. Gylfi Sigurdsson scores from the penalty spot but he could not prevent Swansea suffering defeat to Southampton Sigurdsson dispatched the spot-kick and there was a brief rally from Monk's side as Andre Ayew forced Martin Stekelenburg into a save after good work from the substitute Montero. After last week's disappointment at home to Manchester United, it was a strong performance from the Saints and they will go to Chelsea next week full of confidence. As for Swansea, their indifferent start to the campaign continues and they face a tough fixture next week as a Tottenham side resurgent following their 4-1 victory over Manchester City travels to the Liberty Stadium. Garry Monk was forthcoming in highlighting the areas which cost Swansea and insists they will be addressed Garry Monk was forthcoming in highlighting the areas which cost Swansea and insists they will be addressed Tony Cottee's Soccer Saturday verdict \"It was a strange game because both teams had spells where they were on top of the game but Southampton scored at those times. \"The key spell of the game was probably the first 15 minutes of the second half when Southampton got the second and third goal. Once it was 3-0 it was pretty much game over. Swansea got a consolation penalty towards the end but Southampton, I would say, deserved to win without hitting that top gear. \"Right from the kick-off, Swansea were really, really sloppy. They took a while to recover, but by the time they recovered they were already a goal down and chasing the game for the rest of the match. Swansea will be alright, they're going to probably be mid-table again but they can't afford to keep losing too many matches.\" Tony Cottee gave his thoughts on Southampton's 3-1 win at home to Swansea Tony Cottee gave his thoughts on Southampton's 3-1 win at home to Swansea Player ratings: Southampton: Stekelenburg (6), Cedric (6), Fonte (6), van Dijk (8), Bertrand (7), Wanyama (6), Ward-Prowse (6), S.

of the season with a 2-1 win over Bournemouth, who lost Callum Wilson to a serious-looking knee injury. It appeared Jon Walters' first-half goal would be enough to seal the win but though Dan Gosling equalised on 76 minutes substitute Mame Biram Diouf headed home the winner six minutes from time. Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe says Callum Wilson's injury during his side's 2-1 loss to Stoke is extremely worrying Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe says Callum Wilson's injury during his side's 2-1 loss to Stoke is extremely worrying It capped a miserable day for Bournemouth as Wilson, who has scored five Premier League goals this season, was taken off early in the first-half on a stretcher and needed oxygen after twisting his knee. Stoke went into the contest having made their worst start to a Premier League season, taking just three points from six games. Callum Wilson of Bournemouth is taken off on a stretcher against Stoke It was a timid start from both teams and the game had to be stopped for nearly 10 minutes as Wilson needed medical treatment. The striker went to ground hurt in the eighth minute having appeared to twist his knee while under the attentions of Philipp Wollscheid. He received treatment on the field before managing to walk off it - and shortly after, came back on. But Wilson was almost immediately back down, his leg having buckled as he ran towards the ball. Wilson leaves the field on a stretcher He subsequently departed on a stretcher, replaced by Glenn Murray, to leave his team-mates looking a little shell-shocked, and Stoke grabbed the lead on 32 minutes. Marko Arnautovic produced the magic down the left flank and did well to get around Simon Francis, pulling the ball back for Walters, who tapped in from close-range. Matt Ritchie should have levelled the game on 44 minutes but Erik Pieters did a fine job of blocking his close-range shot. Stoke's Mame Diouf says his side's 2-1 win against Bournemouth - their first victory of the season - was hugely needed Stoke's Mame Diouf says his side's 2-1 win against Bournemouth - their first victory of the season - was hugely needed Stoke became very nervous as the second-half wore on and the visitors levelled with 14 minutes to play. Marc Pugh struck an effort from outside the box and the ball ricocheted to Gosling, who shot low past Jack Butland.

Reaction from Cheikhou Kouyate, who scored a last-minute equaliser at home to Norwich to secure a point for West Ham Reaction from Cheikhou Kouyate, who scored a last-minute equaliser at home to Norwich to secure a point for West Ham Second-half substitute Nathan Redmond restored Norwich's lead with six minutes remaining to seemingly put them on their way for their first victory in east London for 26 years. But Kouyate's equaliser deep into stoppage-time ensured West Ham claimed a point to stay third in the Premier League. Norwich move down two places to 13th despite the draw. Dimitri Payet and Alexander Tettey compete for the ball during an entertaining game at the Boleyn Ground Following the midweek Capital One Cup defeat to Leicester, West Ham manager Slaven Bilic reverted back to near enough the same side that claimed a 2-1 victory over Manchester City last Saturday, with Kouyate coming in for Pedro Obiang his only change. In their bid to claim their fourth successive league win, the Hammers started poorly and fell behind in the ninth minute as Brady capitalised on a loose pass from Noble, raced away from the home defence and slotted his shot past West Ham goalkeeper Adrian. Nathan Redmond thought his 83rd-minute strike was going to be enough to secure victory for Norwich Nathan Redmond thought his 83rd-minute strike was going to be enough to secure victory for Norwich Norwich, coming off the back of their 3-0 Capital One Cup victory over West Bromwich Albion in midweek, were looking to stretch their unbeaten league run to three matches and continued to look the most threatening of the two sides with midfielder Jonny Howson firing just over the crossbar midway through the first-half. The visitors were made to rue that miss as West Ham levelled just after the half-hour mark through Sakho. The forward started the move by playing a sublime first time pass to Payet, who controlled the ball on the right before crossing for Sakho to tap home from just outside the six-yard box. Robbie Brady celebrates scoring for Norwich in the 2-2 draw West Ham came close to taking the lead through midfielder Manuel Lanzini shortly after equalising, but the Argentine's free-kick from 25-yards out whistled just past the post. Norwich nearly restored their advantage shortly after the break through Howson, however the midfielder's powerful effort from just outside the 18-yard box was matched by an outstanding save from Adrian. Sakho was unfortunate not to double his tally for the afternoon on the hour with a header that was just about kept out by Norwich goalkeeper John Ruddy. Alex Neil says his Norwich side had three points 'in their hands' against West Ham Alex Neil says his Norwich side had three points 'in their hands' against West Ham Norwich boss Alex Neil rung the changes midway through the second-half with Dieumerci Mbokani and Redmond coming on, with the decision to introduce the latter paying dividends. Redmond, collecting a pass on the left from Wes Hoolahan, shifted the ball past Noble and onto his right foot before curling his effort beyond Adrian into the bottom corner of the net. Slaven Bilic says both sides would have been disappointed to lose after West Ham's 2-2 draw at home to Norwich Slaven Bilic says both sides would have been disappointed to lose after West Ham's 2-2 draw at home to Norwich The winger's goal had seemingly sent Norwich on their way to a second away victory of the season, however Kouyate's goal deep into injury-time ensured they were denied with Ruddy arguably at fault. Ruddy failed to deal with Payet's delivery from the right and split the ball into the path of Kouyate. The midfielder made no mistake and claimed his third league goal of the season to save his side from defeat.

Jamie Redknapp and Thierry Henry discuss Ramires' game changing performance for Chelsea against Newcastle. Late goals from substitutes Ramires and Willian denied Newcastle their first win of the season as Chelsea fought back to claim a 2-2 draw at St James' Park. Steve McClaren's side were much the better team in the first 45 minutes of the Saturday Night Football contest in the Premier League and the Magpies took the lead in the 42nd minute thanks to Ayoze Perez's strike. Chelsea came out with renewed intensity after the interval but they found themselves 2-0 down when Georginio Wijnaldum stole a march on the Chelsea defence to head home Perez's cross. Georginio Wijnaldum celebrates after making it 2-0 to Newcastle in the second half Jose Mourinho reacted by throwing on Ramires and Willian and it was the Brazilian substitutes who came to the Portuguese manager's rescue with two strikes in the last 11 minutes to earn a point. Ramires could have won it late on but was denied by Tim Krul and the result means McClaren is still awaiting his first Premier League win as Newcastle boss, while Mourinho is still yet to taste victory in the league at St James' Park.

Jamie Redknapp and Thierry Henry discuss Ramires' game changing performance for Chelsea against Newcastle. With Diego Costa serving the second of his three-match ban, Mourinho picked Loic Remy ahead of Radamel Falcao and he was nearly rewarded in the 12th minute when the Frenchman turned Branislav Ivanovic's cross goalwards, only to see the ball flash wide of the near post. Newcastle responded through Wijnaldum as he easily beat Ivanovic for pace before whipping in a cross for the returning Aleksandar Mitrovic, who got above Gary Cahill but could not direct his header inside the far post. Aleksandar Mitrovic tangles with Oscar It was the home side who looked the better of the two sides and they would have been ahead were it not for a double save from Asmir Begovic in the 29th minute. The Bosnian goalkeeper first denied Perez and just seconds later got down low to his left to keep out Daryl Janmaat's effort. Branislav Ivanovic felt that it was a difficult day for Chelsea, after they came from two goals down to draw at Newcastle Branislav Ivanovic felt that it was a difficult day for Chelsea, after they came from two goals down to draw at Newcastle In the 38th minute, Cesc Fabregas tested Krul from distance but the Dutch goalkeeper palmed the ball away to safety. Minutes later, there were shouts from the visitors for a penalty as the ball hit Moussa Sissoko's arm in the penalty area but Martin Atkinson was well positioned to wave away the appeal. Ayoze Perez celebrates his opener for Newcastle Despite that, it was a half to forget for Mourinho's men and Newcastle's dominance was finally rewarded when Perez took advantage of poor defending from Kurt Zouma and Ivanovic to bring Vurnon Anita's long ball down and fire it past Begovic. After the break, Chelsea started brightly with Fabregas picking out Remy, his header brilliantly saved by Krul, despite the linesman's flag being raised.

However, it was Newcastle who struck next as Wijnaldum escaped Fabregas in the penalty area to nod home Perez's cross in the 60th minute. Loic Remy and Fabricio Coloccini challenge for the ball Mourinho responded by bringing on Willian and Falcao for Nemanja Matic and Remy, but it was not until the introduction of Ramires in the 73rd minute that Chelsea sprung to life.

The goal capped a brilliant day for the Norwich City captain who witnessed the birth of his child in the morning, before flying up to Merseyside to make kick-off. Liverpool surged forward in search of a winner, but John Ruddy made a string of brilliant saves to deny Brendan Rodgers' side victory. The draw leaves Liverpool in 13th after six games, level on eight points with Norwich in 11th. Norwich City's Russell Martin had more than one reason to celebrate Norwich City's Russell Martin had more than one reason to celebrate Rodgers put Sturridge straight into the starting line-up after a five-month injury lay-off as Liverpool went in search of a much-needed win. But like Liverpool, the England international looked rusty - lacking tempo and guile in attack. Norwich did a fantastic job of frustrating the hosts with a well organised, disciplined performance. They restricted Liverpool to toothless possession football and whenever the hosts looked to breach the defensive lines with a killer pass there was a yellow and green barricade standing in the way. In their desperation to ease the tension at Anfield, James Milner and Sturridge went looking for penalties with apparent dives. Unimpressed, referee Anthony Taylor waved played on. For all their huff and puff, Liverpool only fashioned one clear-cut chance in the first half and it fell to returning hero Sturridge. Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool and Robbie Brady of Norwich City clash Sloppy play from Martin presented Lucas with the ball and the Brazilian midfielder slid a pass into the feet of Sturridge, who was standing in acres of space with just Ruddy to beat. Rather than take a touch, Sturridge snatched at the chance and fired a tame first-time shot straight at Ruddy who beat it out. After a laboured first half performance and a tweak to his hamstring, Christian Benteke went off at half-time, with Ings taking his place. The summer signing made an instant impact, scoring with one of his first touches. The impressive Alberto Moreno, who looked like Liverpool's most dangerous player during the 90 minutes, clipped a ball over the top to Ings who raced clear of his marker and slid a smart finish under the advancing Ruddy. The tension around the stadium was lifting, giving Liverpool the freedom to express themselves. Daniel Sturridge shoots towards goal on his return Just after the hour mark they lost concentration and the visitors stunned Anfield. Martin did brilliantly to chest down a clearance from Simon Mignolet and loop it back over the goalkeeper to make it 1-1. Buoyed by the goal the visitors nearly took the lead when Matt Jarvis met a cross from Nathan Redmond with a side-foot finish, but Mignolet did well to block the close-range effort with his legs. Rodgers replaced a frustrated Sturridge with Roberto Firmino as he went looking for the win. The Brazilian almost replicated the impact of Ings with a stinging shot that Ruddy beat out. The best chance fell to Coutinho, who will have nightmares about his miss tonight. After a quick counter-attack the Liverpool midfielder found himself one-on-one with Ruddy. The Norwich goalkeeper stayed big and used his body to block the Brazilian's shot. Coutinho could have squared the ball to a team-mate, but he hesitated and wasted the chance. Liverpool kept pushing forward, but Norwich stood firm and defended excellently to earn a point. Canaries boss Alex Neil will take great encouragement from this result which will give his newly-promoted side real belief they can do more than just survive in this league. Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers was left feeling disappointed after a lack of concentration allowed Norwich City to take a point from Anfield.

celebrates scoring his second goal against Southampton Anthony Martial scored twice on his first Premier League start as Manchester United beat Southampton 3-2 at St Mary's. The £36m summer signing from Monaco showed good composure to level in the 34th minute after Graziano Pelle had given Saints an early lead. Martial then capitalised on a poor backpass from Maya Yoshida to double the advantage before David de Gea pulled off a brilliant save to keep out Jose Fonte's header. Juan Mata netted the third in the 68th minute after Memphis Depay struck the post and United held out for victory - even though Pelle pulled a goal back for Saints in the closing stages. The victory moves United up to second in the table, just two points behind leaders Manchester City, and maintains their excellent record at St Mary's, where they have won on nine of their last 11 visits. Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal was pleased with Manchester United's passing game during their 3-2 win over Southampton. Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal was pleased with Manchester United's passing game during their 3-2 win over Southampton. While Martial was the star of the show with his two goals, De Gea's display should also not be underrated. The save to keep out Fonte's header from under the bar was outstanding and he also denied Victor Wanyama late on as United came under increasing pressure. Graziano Pelle (centre) celebrates with Jose Fonte (L) after scoring the opening goal The visitors were without former Saint Luke Shaw after his injury in midweek but Wayne Rooney returned to the side following an injury. Saints made three changes from their draw with West Brom and started on top as United's defence failed to cope with the movement from Saido Mane, Dusan Tadic and Pelle. The hosts made their early superiority count as James Ward-Prowse's cross was turned towards goal by Mane, with De Gea only able to push his save into the direction of Pelle, who made no mistake in tucking away the rebound. Watch the 44-passes which lead to Juan Mata's goal in Manchester United's 3-2 win over Southampton. Watch the 44-passes which lead to Juan Mata's goal in Manchester United's 3-2 win over Southampton. Pelle should have doubled the advantage not long afterwards but struck the post when through on goal. The miss proved costly as United came into the game more as the half wore on. They equalised when Morgan Schneiderlin's forward header was collected by Mata, who was in an offside position, and when he was tackled, Martial showed composure to control and finish. Martial gave United the lead in the second half Schneiderlin then fired wide from a short-corrner routine but United went ahead not long after half-time as Yoshida played a tame backpass and Martial again kept his cool to score. The mistake from the defender seemed to breed indecision in the Saints back four and it was skipper Jose Fonte who was next to surrender possession - with Memphis Depay screwing a shot just wide. Fonte came close to drawing the hosts level but his near-post header from Tadic's corner was superbly pushed away by De Gea. It proved to be a crucial save as United started to control the game and got a third when Depay struck the post and Mata was on hand to finish the rebound. Juan Mata's goal came after 44 passes It looked as though the visitors would see out a comfortable victory but Pelle ensured a nervy finish when he headed home Mane's cross with four minutes remaining. Saints pushed for a late equaliser, only for De Gea to keep out Wanyama's shot from just outside the box with a diving stop.

Gabriel was then dismissed by referee Mike Dean moments later for appearing to flick his leg at Costa as they retreated to the halfway line, sparking an angry response from the defender.

The game started in lively fashion as Aaron Ramsey had a shot blocked and Fabregas saw an effort saved by Cech, playing at Stamford Bridge for the first time since his summer move to Arsenal. Walcott forced Asmir Begovic into a low save at the other end but the hosts started to dominate possession as the half wore on. Pedro got behind the Arsenal defence but was unable to get the ball under control before having a shot from the edge of the box that Cech pushed away. The main talking point of the half came in the final few minutes though. Diego Costa was booked for his part in the exchange at the end of the first half It all started when Costa and Koscielny clashed in the box, with the striker putting two hands to the face of the defender and then hitting him with a swinging arm. Gabriel became involved in the heated exchange and was booked along with Costa by the referee. But worse was to follow for the visitors as Gabriel was dismissed for flicking a leg out at Costa as the two players walked back to the halfway line. Gabriel reacted furiously to the decision and had to be held back from confronting Costa while Wenger waited for the referee and then followed him down the tunnel as he walked off for half-time. Wenger's tactical response was to take off Francis Coquelin and bring on Calum Chambers, but the 10-man Gunners could not hold out for long in the second half. Fabregas curled a free-kick into the box and Zouma arrived unmarked at the back post to head past Cech. Gabriel and Diego Costa clash With a numerical advantage, the home side dominated possession and Hazard tested Cech with a shot from the edge of the area. Arsenal could have levelled, though, as Alexis Sanchez latched onto a ball over the top but missed the target from close range.

"report": "West Brom captain Darren Fletcher couldn't hide his delight after his side's win against Aston Villa West Brom captain Darren Fletcher couldn't hide his delight after his side's win against Aston Villa Saido Berahino scored the winner on his return to the starting line-up as a really well-organised West Brom side secured a deserved 1-0 victory at the home of local rivals Aston Villa. Albion have yet to concede a goal on their Premier League travels this season and they produced another masterful away performance here, keeping a subdued Villa side very quiet. And Berahino, who threatened not to play for the Baggies again after the club rejected transfer bids for the England U21 forward from Tottenham, marked his first start since then by touching a James Morrison shot into the net just before half-time to win it for the visitors. The Baggies are up to 10th in the table but problems are mounting for Villa, who barely had a shot in anger and are just a point and a place above the drop zone. West Brom made the brighter start and almost led inside three minutes when Chris Brunt sent over a lovely cross from the left and Salomon Rondon nodded it goalwards, only for Brad Guzan to pull off a good reflex save. Saido Berahino deflected a Morrison shot past Guzan to give West Brom the advantage Jonny Evans then headed over the crossbar from a Villa corner but the hosts gradually began to improve and Claudio Yacob blocked a Carles Gil effort, after Gabriel Agbonlahor had done well down the left. But Guzan remained the busier keeper and he had to plunge to his left to keep out a curling effort from Darren Fletcher which was heading for the bottom corner. And the visitors grabbed the lead five minutes before the break after Craig Dawson was too strong for Jordan Amavi down the right-hand side. The ball broke to James McClean and his cross found its way to Rondon, who teed up Morrison for a shot which Berahino did well to divert past Guzan. West Brom captain Darren Fletcher couldn't hide his delight after his side's win against Aston Villa West Brom captain Darren Fletcher couldn't hide his delight after his side's win against Aston Villa Villa brought big striker Rudy Gestede off the bench at half-time but Rondon was making more of an impact at the other end and Guzan nervously grabbed the ball at the second attempt after the Baggies forward had turned neatly on the edge of the box and unleashed a powerful drive. Carlos Sanchez had fired over from distance at the other end, and the hosts were then denied a leveller in somewhat controversial fashion with 20 minutes left. Micah Richards headed into the net after a Jack Grealish cross but referee Martin Atkinson had already blown the whistle for a foul on the Villa youngster. The two managers shared a joke before kick-off but Tony Pulis was the only man smiling at full-time To add to the misery of the home fans, Ashley Westwood put the subsequent free-kick over the bar and, although the hosts put plenty of crosses into the box in the final 15 minutes, Evans and Gareth McAuley led the way as West Brom defended competently, and in numbers. Villa finally got a half-chance in stoppage-time when Lenadro Bacuna sent over a good cross from the right and his fellow sub Gestede rose to meet it at the near post but he sent his powerful header over the bar and the home fans began to head for the exits. West Brom celebrated jubilantly at the final whistle, experienced manager Tony Pulis having masterminded another fine away display, while Villa boss Tim Sherwood was left to wonder how he can get more out of his below-par side. West Brom manager Tony Pulis told Sky Sports that he believes his team played better that Aston Villa and deserved the three points.

Soccer Saturday verdict - Charlie Nicholas \"I have watched Aston Villa maybe three times this season and I have been encouraged with some of their performances in an attacking sense, Micah Richards was a good signing for them, but today I didn't see any real quality from them. West Brom bossed this from the start. \"Some of them look scared. The quality, the craft, guile was poor. He could have subbed any one of six or seven for me today. It was a very average and tame performance from them.

Callum Wilson opened the scoring early on with his fifth goal in four Premier League games, before Ritchie's spectacular volley gave the home side an unassailable two-goal lead inside the first 10 minutes. Sunderland had a Jeremain Lens header ruled out for offside in the second half before Younes Kaboul picked up his second caution of the game and was sent off to compound the Black Cats' misery. Bournemouth made a blistering start to the contest and went ahead after four minutes with the first clear opportunity of the game. Bournemouth beat Sunderland 2-0 to secure their first ever home victory in the Premier League Bournemouth beat Sunderland 2-0 to secure their first ever home victory in the Premier League Dan Gosling burst forward and fed Wilson who turned Kaboul with consummate ease before rifling home low and hard past Costel Pantilimon. Bournemouth stepped it up after the opener and doubled their advantage five minutes later after Sebastien Coates turned the ball behind for a corner. The subsequent cross was headed away by Kaboul but only to Ritchie who was just over 25 yards away from goal. The midfielder took the ball on his chest before unleashing an unstoppable left-footed volley which flew into the top corner, evading Pantilimon. Bournemouth's Matt Ritchie helped his side to a 2-0 victory over Sunderland scoring a stunning volley from outside the box Bournemouth's Matt Ritchie helped his side to a 2-0 victory over Sunderland scoring a stunning volley from outside the box Jordi Gomez struck the post with a low free-kick from an acute angle for Sunderland before Jermain Defoe stumbled when clean through on goal, scuffing his shot and allowing Artur Boruc to make a save. Defoe put a free header wide moments later before Wilson stretched Sunderland at the back and was bundled over by Kaboul who picked up a booking. Sunderland's Jack Rodwell revealed he had no complaints after his side's 2-0 defeat Sunderland's Jack Rodwell revealed he had no complaints after his side's 2-0 defeat Lens thought he had pulled a goal back for Sunderland eight minutes after the restart after Borini had won a corner. The corner was taken short before the cross found Lens at the back post, who headed past Boruc only to be incorrectly penalised for offside. Borini then saw an effort similar to Ritchie's drift over after chesting and volleying from the edge of the area.

Marc Pugh saw a volley into the ground bounce up and come off the crossbar late on before Pantilimon was called into action again during added time to deny substitute Glenn Murray.

Fresh from sealing Watford's first win of the season against Swansea last weekend, Ighalo needed just 10 minutes to open the scoring at St James' Park when his low near-post finish beat Tim Krul. The newly-promoted side outworked their hosts for the majority of the first half on Tyneside and doubled their lead when the Nigeria international latched onto Troy Deeney's through pass, rounded the 'keeper and slipped the ball home on 28 minutes. Newcastle boss Steve McClaren said his players must keep calm and dust themselves down following their 2-1 loss Newcastle boss Steve McClaren said his players must keep calm and dust themselves down following their 2-1 loss The hosts put in an improved display after the break, thanks in part to Daryl Janmaat who halved the deficit shortly after the hour mark. But Watford held on for their first victory at St James' since 1981, while Steve McClaren's wait for a first victory as Newcastle manager continues. Both sides made one change ahead of the game, with McClaren calling Ayoze Perez into an attack-minded line-up, while Watford brought in Ben Watson in place of the suspended Valon Behrami. Ighalo round Tim Krul for his and Watford's second goal The visitors had the first opening of the game as Deeney and Almen Abdi combined to set up Ighalo on seven minutes, but the striker dragged his effort wide of the target. The frantic opening to the game was illustrated moments later when Moussa Sissoko appeared to be tugged in the area, but referee Roger East waved the penalty claims away. Goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes celebrates after Watford score their second goal Ighalo's earlier miss proved to be just a sighter as he broke the deadlock in the next attack. Abdi, Deeney and Etienne Capoue all combined to set up the in-form striker and he duly obliged, nestling the ball in the bottom of Krul's goal. Newcastle rallied and came close to an immediate response as Papiss Cisse inexcusably missed the target with a near-post effort on 14 minutes. Ighalo took his tally to four Premier League goals this season The game then opened up momentarily as both sides exchanged blows before Ighalo struck for his and Watford's second on 28 minutes. Deeney showed brilliant control to gather a lofted pass up field before having the vision to feed Ighalo in behind the Newcastle rearguard and his strike partner made no mistake. Steve McClaren without a win in the Premier League as Newcastle manager The Hornets were well worth their half-time lead and McClaren was forced to react at the interval, bringing on Siem de Jong in place of the ineffective Cisse. The second half took a while to going as Watford defended their lead against a toothless Newcastle attack. Janmaat then took matters into his own hands, hauling his side to within one goal when he converted Sissoko's hooked pass in the area. The Dutchman worked tirelessly in pursuit of an equaliser, drawing Heurelho Gomes into a smart save before constantly trying to find team-mates in advanced positions. But Watford stood firm, surviving a late penalty claim after Sebastian Prodl's challenge on Perez, to win for the second week on the bounce.

Wijnaldum was nowhere to be seen in the first half. Thauvin is awful, he just runs with the ball all the time, there's never any end product. He looks very lightweight, and got pushed off by a lot of physical players for Watford. He runs down a lot of blind alleys. There's no sort of creativity from him at all. I am surprised he stayed on as long as he did. The biggest disappointment is Cisse. I questioned whether he would play, or should play and he was on from the start. He was off at half-time.

Stoke raced into a commanding half-time lead thanks to two goals in seven minutes from Bojan and Jon Walters. But a penalty from Riyad Mahrez six minutes after the restart allowed Leicester back into the game and Jamie Vardy completed the comeback with a 69th-minute equaliser. Bojan opened the scoring for Stoke against Leicester It was the second time in seven days that Leicester had gone 2-0 behind, but unlike in their 3-2 win over Aston Villa last Sunday, they were unable to snatch a winner in an entertaining contest. The result moves Leicester on to 12 points but prolongs Stoke's winless start to the campaign and leaves Mark Hughes' side on just three points. Leicester made the better start and could have taken the lead when Jeff Schlupp cut the ball back to in-form top-scorer Mahrez on the edge of the D, but the Algerian's tame left-foot shot was easily saved by Jack Butland. Stoke manager Mark Hughes was frustrated by both his players and the referee Stoke manager Mark Hughes was frustrated by both his players and the referee The scare woke Stoke up and they took the lead three minutes later, after Marko Arnautovic cut in from the left wing and slipped through Bojan, who marked his first league start since January by slotting low past Kasper Schmeichel in the 13th minute. Confidence suddenly surged through the hosts and they doubled their advantage in the 20th minute, albeit with a huge helping hand from Wes Morgan. The Leicester centre-back fluffed a back-pass to Schmeichel and Walters duly ran on to the loose ball and sidefooted home. Leicester manager Claudio Ranieri was proud of his team after they fought back from 2-0 down Leicester manager Claudio Ranieri was proud of his team after they fought back from 2-0 down Leicester made a slow start to the second half but were gifted a route back into the game when Arnautovic needlessly bundled over Danny Drinkwater just inside the box. Mahrez converted the resulting penalty with aplomb and, in doing so, injected fresh belief and energy into the visitors. Leicester striker Jamie Vardy felt his team needed to show spirit after being 2-0 down at half-time to Stoke Leicester striker Jamie Vardy felt his team needed to show spirit after being 2-0 down at half-time to Stoke Vardy squandered two chances to equalise, first slicing a volley over and then shooting straight at Butland, but out of nothing, he then finally brought his side level with a scuffed left-foot shot after Mahrez had flicked a goal-kick into his path. Both teams pushed hard for a winner, but the closest either came was a low right-footer from Vardy that rolled narrowly wide in the 94th minute. Soccer Saturday verdict - Paul Merson \"At half-time I am not sure if they swapped shirts, it was all Leicester in the second half. Sometimes it is easy to play when you are 2-0 down, you haven't got the pressure on you. If anyone was going to win it, you'd have said Leicester. Fair play, if it was a boxing match you would have stopped it at half-time. \"Stoke were absolutely brilliant, at half-time I said they were Harlem Globetrotters. The second half was completely brilliant. It's a nightmare for the manager because you go in at half-time 2-0 up so what do you say to the players?\" Player ratings Stoke: Butland (7); Johnson (6), Cameron (6), Wilson (6), Pieters (6); Whelan (6), Van Ginkel (7); Shaqiri (7), Bojan (8), Arnautovic (6); Walters (7).

The Belgian was given his marching orders for a studs up challenge on Mo Barrow in the last minute of added time, just two minutes after coming on as a substitute. That came after a second half that had been dominated by Roberto Martinez's side with Romelu Lukaku guilty of passing up two excellent opportunities to put his side ahead. The former Chelsea striker was put through on goal twice, firstly by a slide rule pass from Gareth Barry down the right channel. Lukaku took a touch before blazing the shoot high and wide with his weaker right foot. The second came from Ross Barkley's pass but Lukaku's first-time shot was kept out well by Lukasz Fabianski who had been quick off his line to narrow the angle. Before that Arouna Kone had failed to convert after being set up by Barkley. The midfielder got away down the left and cut the ball back across the six-yard box where Kone stood with the goal gaping. However, the Ivorian was unable to adjust his feet in time and the chance went begging. Gerard Deulofeu came off the bench and caused Swansea even more problems down the Everton right. He put in a wicked cross that just evaded Lukaku and Steven Naismith as both flung themselves at the cross. Jonjo Shelvey is tackled by James McCarthy in goalless draw Everton also had the better of the first half as they controlled possession and largely managed to stifle Swansea's attacking play. However, it was the hosts who twice could have taken the lead through top scorer Bafetimbi Gomis. The striker first tested Tim Howard with a well-struck half-volley after adjusting his body quickly to meet Kyle Naughton's cross. If he did well with the first, Gomis will have been disappointed not to finish the second. A poor header from Barry put him in the clear and having kept the chasing defenders at bay, Gomis scuffed the shot wide of Howard's right-hand post. Roberto Martinez praised his players’ ‘terrific’ performance as Everton drew 0-0 with Swansea at the Liberty Stadium Roberto Martinez praised his players’ ‘terrific’ performance as Everton drew 0-0 with Swansea at the Liberty Stadium Everton had chances of their own though as the half wore on and after a hat-trick last weekend, Naismith will feel he should have done better after a rapid Everton counter-attack. He took too long on the ball after being played in by Lukaku though and Neil Taylor got back to make the tackle. The same pair combined shortly afterwards, Naismith driving a shot at goal after a corner was only partially cleared with Lukaku sticking a leg out to try and divert it goalwards. The Belgian got too much on it though and Fabianski was able to save comfortably. Tyias Browning also impressed on his full league debut as he largely kept Jefferson Montero quiet down the Swansea left. The Blues were even more dominant in the second period and Kone should have put them in front within three minutes of the interval from Barkley's cut back. James McCarthy says he’s happy Everton left the Liberty Stadium with a point following their 0-0 draw with Swansea James McCarthy says he’s happy Everton left the Liberty Stadium with a point following their 0-0 draw with Swansea The chances continued to come at regular intervals but a mixture of excellent last ditch defending, in particular from Ashley Williams, and some wasteful finishing ensured Garry Monk's side survived the onslaught. Lukaku had another shot cleared off the line by Williams while Brendan Galloway's powerful shot was also headed over the top by the Wales skipper. Having ridden their luck for large periods of the game, Swansea almost snatched a late winner as Barrow, who looked bright when he came on, crossed towards fellow-substitute Eder only for the impressive John Stones to get there first to clear. Garry Monk says a draw was a fair result after Swansea’s 0-0 draw with Everton Garry Monk says a draw was a fair result after Swansea’s 0-0 draw with Everton It would have been extremely harsh on Everton and a frustrating afternoon was added to when Mirallas went in over the top of the ball with his studs showing in a challenge with Barrow. After consulting with his assistant, referee Stuart Attwell produced the red card and Mirallas could have few complaints. Soccer Saturday verdict - Matt Le Tissier \"I don't think Mirallas can have any complaints at all. When you go over the top of the ball like that and your studs go into the opponents ankle, it's dangerous play.

Slaven Bilic's side raced into a 2-0 lead thanks to strikes by Victor Moses and Diafra Sakho - the first goals City had conceded in the league this campaign - only for City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne to pull a goal back for the home side just before half-time, his first for his new club. However, West Ham held on for all three points thanks to a resolute second-half display, a result that moves the Hammers up to second in the table, while City remain top despite this setback. The home side suffered a huge blow just prior to kick-off when influential playmaker David Silva picked up an injury in the warm-up, with the Spain international joining captain Vincent Kompany on the sidelines. However, City were at least able to call upon striker Sergio Aguero once again after injury, while the visitors were also boosted by the return from suspension of goalkeeper Adrian. Diafra Sakho is mobbed after scoring his team's second goal And it was not long before the Spaniard was called into action as the goalkeeper was forced to keep out Fernandinho's powerful header after an early right-wing De Bruyne corner. However, if that close call was meant to result in an avalanche of chances for the Premier League leaders, they and their supporters were much mistaken,as it was West Ham who opened the scoring after just six minutes. In-form midfielder Dimitri Payet was once again involved in the strike, with the Frenchman finding on-loan Chelsea winger Moses in a central position some 25 yards out, before the Nigerian then beat Joe Hart at his near post with a low shot, the first league goal City had let in this season. West Ham captain Mark Noble believes his team-mates executed manager Slaven Bilic's game plan perfectly West Ham captain Mark Noble believes his team-mates executed manager Slaven Bilic's game plan perfectly Manuel Pellegrini's side responded to that setback by very nearly drawing level just minutes later, however, having taken advantage of a poor back header by Aaron Cresswell and then beaten the onrushing Adrian, Aguero somehow managed to guide his shot wide of the gaping goal. And Aguero and City were made to pay for that miss when West Ham doubled their lead just past the half-hour mark, meaning the home team had conceded as many goals in this game as they had in their previous nine contests at the Etihad. West Ham manager Slaven Bilic believes his players showed enough fighting spirit in the second half to beat Man City West Ham manager Slaven Bilic believes his players showed enough fighting spirit in the second half to beat Man City West Ham right-back Carl Jenkinson did well to break up field and win his team a corner, from which Winston Reid rose powerfully to flick on Payet's delivery, and after a scramble in the six-yard box, Sakho found himself in the right place at the right time to toe-poke home West Ham's second of the night. City had to respond in what little time they had before the interval, and that is exactly what they did in first-half stoppage time thanks to a well-taken goal by their £54m signing De Bruyne on his first Premier League start for the club. The Belgium international picked up possession of the ball deep in West Ham's half after a neat Aguero layoff and after making space for himself, the midfielder beat Adrian with a well-struck shot from distance to bring the home side right back into the contest. However, if that well-timed strike was meant to lead to a dramatic City comeback, Pellegrini's team were just unable to find a way past a brilliant Adrian in the second period as West Ham's 'keeper made a string of brilliant saves to deny the league leaders. City midfielder Yaya Toure was a little unlucky as two of his drives flashed just wide of Adrian's far post in the opening 15 minutes of the second period, while the Ivorian was also denied by a brilliant close-range block by that man Adrian.

The visitors, meanwhile, could have made the final half an hour a lot more comfortable had Sakho not missed a great opening when played through one on one with Hart just before the hour-mark. However, with Adrian virtually unbeatable on his return to the team - the shot stopper also made crucial blocks to keep out both Aguero and Jesus Navas in the final quarter of the game, before a brilliant reaction save late on denied Nicolas Otamendi - West Ham were able to record famous away wins at Arsenal, Liverpool and City.

"report": "Jamie Carragher and Gary Neville were full of praise for West Ham's Dimitri Payet after his two goals helped his side to a 2-0 win over Newcastle on Monday Jamie Carragher and Gary Neville were full of praise for West Ham's Dimitri Payet after his two goals helped his side to a 2-0 win over Newcastle on Monday Dimitri Payet scored twice to give West Ham a 2-0 victory that leaves Newcastle bottom of the Premier League table with manager Steve McClaren without a win in five matches. The France attacker steered home a superb opener on nine minutes before firing in his second from close-range after Victor Moses had hit the bar three minutes into the second half. The hosts looked in firm control for the majority of the game and Newcastle's chances were scant, with right-back Daryl Janmaat going closest when he forced Darren Randolph to save in the first half. And Slaven Bilic's side had enough control to hand Andy Carroll a late return to action after eight months out with a knee injury. But there was little comfort for Newcastle boss McClaren, whose side arrived at Upton Park less than 50 minutes before kick-off, and seemed to be affected by the delay. West Ham captain Mark Noble has praised the quality of his teammate Dimitri Payet after the 2-0 win over Newcastle West Ham captain Mark Noble has praised the quality of his teammate Dimitri Payet after the 2-0 win over Newcastle Newcastle's players and staff had to walk the final leg of their journey after traffic prevented their bus getting close to the ground, and they did not look ready when Payet fired the Hammers into the lead. Captain Mark Noble stole in-front of his marker before laying the ball off to Payet on the edge of the penalty area, and he curled home skilfully into the top corner. The summer signing from Marseille ran the show in the first half, and he poked wide from a pass from Moses, who was also excellent on his debut, on 18 minutes. West Ham manager Slaven Bilic claims the performance in the 2-0 win against Newcastle is proof the club is moving in the right direction West Ham manager Slaven Bilic claims the performance in the 2-0 win against Newcastle is proof the club is moving in the right direction At the other end, Janmaat was as surprised as anyone to find himself one-on-one with Randolph after a heavy touch from Vurnon Anita beat West Ham's back-line, but the Hammers keeper got down low to stop the shot. Manuel Lanzini and Moses both shot wide of the target and the Hammers remained unfazed by the loss of defender Angelo Ogbonna, who was replaced by Carl Jenkinson before half-time. After the break, Moses did brilliantly to shrug off defenders and latch onto a long clearance up-field before curling an effort against the woodwork, with Payet on hand to punt home on 48 minutes. Payet doubled West Ham's lead shortly after half-time McClaren reacted by sending on two strikers in Ayoze Perez and Siem de Jong, but both were ineffective as Randolph was tested only once by the latter when he tipped over a deflected shot late on. Carroll emerged with a gleeful smile and to a rapturous applause on 87 minutes, and he came through the remaining moments unscathed having not played since February 11.

Kane celebrates with Ryan Mason, as he lies injured after scoring the only goal in the match Ryan Mason struck late to hand Tottenham their first three points of the season with a 1-0 victory at Sunderland. It took Spurs until the 82nd minute to break the deadlock as Harry Kane combined with substitute Erik Lamela, whose defence-splitting pass found Mason and he chipped the ball past Costel Pantilimon to round off a 15-pass move. Ryan Mason started and finished an excellent team goal in Tottenham's 1-0 win at Sunderland Ryan Mason started and finished an excellent team goal in Tottenham's 1-0 win at Sunderland It was a bitter blow for Dick Advocaat's team, who were the better of the two sides in the first half, hitting the post through former Spurs striker Jermain Defoe shortly before half-time. After the break, Kane's woes in front of goal in the Premier League continued when he missed Mason's cross at the far post, with the game looked to be heading towards a draw. Ryan Mason beat goalkeeper Costel Pantilimon to score the winner But Mason, who was injured in the process of scoring, provided the goal to move his side up to 12th in the table and keep Sunderland, who hit the bar through Jack Rodwell in the closing stages, rooted to the bottom and still looking for a first win. Spurs, who had failed to find the back of the net in four of their last eight Premier League games, burst out of the traps and thought they should have had a penalty inside the first minute when Kyle Walker went down under the challenge of Patrick van Aanholt. Son Heung-Min made his Tottenham debut It gave referee Craig Pawson an early decision to make but he ignored the claims as Sunderland, lifted by a passionate Stadium of Light crowd, started to push forward with intent through the attacking trio of Defoe, debutant Fabio Borini and Jeremain Lens. And it was Borini and Lens who nearly combined in the 10th minute when the former Liverpool striker failed to latch onto the Dutchman's cross. Jermain Defoe hit the post against his former club However, it was Defoe who looked the most likely and he missed a glorious chance to put the hosts ahead in the 26th minute, hitting the post after running onto Lens' inch-perfect through ball. Defoe was giving the Spurs defence a torrid time and he pulled into space again just before the break, firing a shot straight into the arms of Hugo Lloris, despite Toby Alderweireld having a handful of the former England striker's shirt. Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino was pleased that his side's dominance resulted in all three points Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino was pleased that his side's dominance resulted in all three points After the break, Mason was lucky to escape punishment after a studs-up challenge on Borini, and the Sunderland supporters did not hide their frustrations. And minutes later, the England midfielder tried his luck from distance but could not trouble Pantilimon this time. Harry Kane failed to trouble the scorers in Tottenham's win Sunderland hit back and new signing Ola Toivonen should have done better when Billy Jones' deflected shot fell into his patch, but Lloris was quickly off his line to punch the ball clear. The home side continued to press as Lens burst into the Spurs half with just Jan Vertonghen to beat, the Dutchman trying to use his pace to break through on goal, but he was well thwarted by the Belgium international. Sunderland manager Dick Advocaat was surprisingly positive following his side's 1-0 defeat Sunderland manager Dick Advocaat was surprisingly positive following his side's 1-0 defeat Kane's big moment came in the 67th minute when Mason's cross picked out the England striker at the far post, but he kicked nothing but air with just Pantilimon to beat.

Wes Morgan then missed a good opportunity at the other end as he headed over the bar from six yards out. Tim Sherwood was extremely disappointed to see his side let a two-goal lead slip Tim Sherwood was extremely disappointed to see his side let a two-goal lead slip But it was Villa who settled into their stride better and started to dominate possession as the half wore on. Grealish spurned a decent chance when he shot at Kasper Schmeichel from Gil's pass before breaking the deadlock in the 39th minute with a brilliant curling effort from outside the box. Jack Grealish celebrates with manager Tim Sherwood The home side looked as though they could threaten a comeback in the second half as they started on the front foot and Vardy went close. But Villa doubled their advantage against the run of play as Gil scored with another fine first-time finish, curling in a shot from Agbonlahor's cut back. Claudio Ranieri was jubilant following his Leicester side's comeback Claudio Ranieri was jubilant following his Leicester side's comeback At that stage it looked as though Villa would be heading for victory, but they were unable to hold off a superb comeback from the Foxes.

The result condemns Chelsea to their worst league start since 1988 - they now have four points from their opening five games - and the 12 goals they have conceded is more than anyone else in the Premier League. Meanwhile Everton's second victory of the season sees them claim a long-awaited first home win since their defeat of Manchester United in April. Having been brought on in place of the injured Muhamed Besic after only nine minutes Naismith rounded off a great move to head the hosts in front on 17 minutes. After stand-in Chelsea 'keeper Asmir Begovic had denied Arouna Kone and James McCarthy with two brilliant saves, the Scotland international doubled the Toffees' tally with a low strike on 22 minutes. Chelsea clawed themselves back into the game when Nemanja Matic's thunderous drive halved the deficit ten minutes before the interval. But the Chelsea comeback failed to materialise as Naismith became the first player to score a hat-trick against Jose Mourinho in the Premier League with his third eight minutes from time. Jose Mourinho appeared unimpressed with Chelsea display The focus ahead of the game concerned Everton defender John Stones as he lined up against the side who saw had three bids rejected for him over the summer. Stones made a decent start to the game as he set out to prevent a repeat of the last season's 6-3 defeat to Chelsea, where the visitors raced in an early lead. Everton's cause was seemingly not helped when Besic, who was filling in for the injured Tom Cleverley, sustained a hamstring injury inside the opening 10 minutes, with Naismith entering the fray. But it was a game-changing substitution as the Scot struck within 10 minutes of coming on to put the hosts firmly in the driving seat. Roberto Martinez, manager of Everton celebrates the opening goal scored by Steven Naismith against Chelsea Having escaped the clutches of Matic and John Obi Mikel in midfield, he played Brendan Galloway in down the left before racing into the area to head the full-back's cross beyond Begovic from close range. Begovic momentarily kept Everton's lead at one goal as he expertly denied Kone with a fingertip save, before pawing McCarthy's long-range effort out for a corner. But the Bosnia international was helpless as Naismith gathered Ross Barkley's centre and rifled home his, and Everton's second, on 22 minutes. The champions rallied and reduced the arrears when Matic beat Howard with an exquisite strike on 36 minutes, and the Blues came close to levelling things up before half-time as Eden Hazard, John Terry and Pedro had chances. Nemanja Matic gave Chelsea hope with long-range effort But Everton found sanctuary at the break and, when the second half restarted, the game resumed more even in nature. Chelsea struggled to create a clear opening on goal in the second 45, with Howard not called into action at any point. And Naismith was left to cap off a perfect afternoon as he gathered Barkley's disguised pass before drilling the ball home for his third on 82 minutes.

Goals from Theo Walcott and Oliver Giroud sent Arsenal to their first home win of the season as Stoke were humbled 2-0. Arsene Wenger faced heavy criticism after failing to add a striker in the transfer window but both his forwards found the net in a very one-sided contest. Walcott, starting up front instead of Giroud, opened the scoring on 30 minutes after Alexis Sanchez had hit the post twice in the early stages, making it 11 goals in his last 11 Premier League starts. Stoke goalkeeper Jack Butland continued to deny the hosts with a string of wonderful saves but the second goal came with five minutes remaining when substitute Giroud flicked home a header from close range. Arsenal's Olivier Giroud celebrates scoring his team's second goal during the Barclays Premier League match against Stoke City The result means Stoke remain without a win this season and drop to the bottom of the table on goals scored. Walcott got the nod up front as Wenger sent his side out with a clear message to start fast as they chased their first goals of the season at home. They should have been 4-0 up in the first eight minutes but Butland was in no mood to be beaten. Jack Butland dives accross the Stoke City goal mouth during the English Premier League football match between Arsenal and Stoke The Stoke 'keeper tipped an Sanchez effort onto the post with five minutes gone before the same player smacked the same post from 15 yards three minutes later. Walcott then missed a presentable chance from seven yards after a Hector Bellerin cross before Butland again flew across his goal to claw away an Sanchez free-kick. It was one-way traffic towards the Stoke goal as Laurent Koscielny tested Butland with a 30 yard drive and Santi Cazorla was denied from close range by the brilliant shot stopper. However the resistance was finally broken on the half-hour mark. Theo Walcott was on the score sheet for Arsenal in their 2-0 win against Stoke. Theo Walcott was on the score sheet for Arsenal in their 2-0 win against Stoke. Francis Coquelin won back possession in his own half with a thumping tackle, fed the ball to Mesut Ozil, who sent Walcott through on goal with a brilliant clip over the top. The England forward steadied himself and tucked the ball under Butland and into the net. The pace of the game steadied in the second period as Arsenal started to feel the pressure of not taking advantage of their domination. However, Stoke rarely looked capable of testing Petr Cech on his 500th appearance in English football. Mark Hughes gestures during the Barclays Premier League match between Arsenal and Stoke City Ozil should have doubled the lead on 69 minutes but Butland was sharp at his near post to keep out the midfielder from close range. Giroud replaced Walcott with 17 minutes left and should have scored with his first touch but he skewed an effort wide from eight yards after some awful defending by Glenn Whelan. Some groans started to echo around the Emirates following that miss but Giroud came good with five minutes remaining, flicking home a Carzorla free-kick from the left flank past Butland, who was the only Stoke player that didn't deserve to be on the losing side. Walcott celebrates scoring the opening goal with Mesut Ozil Soccer Saturday Verdict - Matt Le Tissier They would have been kicking themselves they weren't three goals ahead in that first half. It really was men against boys. Before Theo Walcott scored, they had six good chances to score a goal. Jack Butland was outstanding in that first period, made three or four good saves. It really was one way traffic - Stoke were properly battered. Arsenal dominated the game, and while it was still 1-0 you were worried Arsenal missed that many chances. Until Olivier Giroud came on and scored the second goal it was still a bit edgy for Arsenal. Stoke are having to rely so heavily on their goalkeeper at the moment, and when your goalkeeper is your player of the season so far it is a big worry for everyone concerned.

But City certainly had the better of the second half and should have gone ahead much earlier when Jesus Navas missed an open goal. David Silva's injury and the late withdrawal of Raheem Sterling forced Pellegrini into changes and he switched to a 4-4-2 with Samir Nasri and Wilfried Bony coming into the side. Despite the impressive atmosphere at Selhurst Park, Palace's home form has struggled to match their counter-attacking efforts on their travels but they started well against the leaders. Yannick Bolasie troubled the City defence down the right channel and twice fired shots at Joe Hart's goal in the early stages. Aguero limps off the pitch after picking up an injury in the first half Pardew's men continued to push hard and Yohan Cabaye had the home fans excited soon after when he went down in the box under a challenge from Fernandinho. The City midfielder did catch his foot but Cabaye's collapse did not persuade referee Mike Jones and it was from the subsequent clearance that Aguero was chopped down. Dann had been turned near the halfway line and elected to foul his man. The challenge appeared to jar the Argentine's knee and he was soon signalling to be withdrawn. Any involvement against Juventus in midweek would seem unlikely. De Bruyne replaced him in a deeper role and had some encouraging early moments on his debut, threading a pass through to Wilfried Bony that might have brought the opener. James McArthur of Crystal Palace is challenged by Aguero of Manchester City Bony turned Brede Hangeland with ease but his left-footed shot was well saved by Alex McCarthy and the striker couldn't connect properly when the ball came back to him. It was an evenly-fought contest and it was soon a booking each when Yaya Toure committed one foul too many. There were even strong words on the sidelines as Pardew and Pellegrini clashed. But the breakthrough goal still wouldn't come, although Navas really should have been the man to find it early in the second half after impressive work by De Bruyne as City broke away. Navas took De Bruyne's pass and rounded McCarthy under pressure but on his weaker left foot, his shot was skewed wide of the near post. Kevin de Bruyne makes his debut for Manchester City against Crystal Palace That chance ushered in a period of City dominance with the likes of Toure, Aleksandar Kolarov, Fernandinho and Samir Nasri all firing off shots from distance. Nasri had a shout for a penalty too when Cabaye seemed to trip him inside the box. But while City controlled the ball there were still chances at the other end with Jason Puncheon's header from Papa Souare's cross midway through the second half forcing a fine save from Hart. Substitute Gayle went even closer in the final minutes but missed the target, seemingly from an offside position, from Wilfried Zaha's right-wing cross and moments later it proved costly. Samir Nasri fired in a hopeful shot from distance and McCarthy was unable to hold onto the ball. Iheanacho scores Manchester City's late winner against Crystal Palace Iheanacho, who had only come onto the pitch a matter of minutes before as a late substitute for Bony, burst beyond his markers and forced the ball home for his first Premier League goal. The Nigerian might even have scored a second in stoppage time but he will settle for the winner that, as well as extending City's lead at the top to five points, also moves them 11 points ahead of champions Chelsea.

Cameron Jerome opened the scoring for the Canaries in an even first half before Norwich put the game out of sight with two counter-attacking goals in the second, Wes Hoolahan with the first before Jarvis curled home to make it 3-0. Bournemouth pulled a goal back with just under 10 minutes to go, centre-back Steve Cook heading home from a corner. The first goal always looked like being important. Norwich got it and survived a good spell of Bournemouth pressure before half-time, culminating in Callum Wilson hitting the post. However, after the break they were always in control and picked the visitors off, time and again on the break. The first half saw both sides battling for dominance during the opening stages with neither side really able to gain a foothold in the first 15 minutes. It was Bournemouth who eventually managed to settle and assert themselves on the game, albeit without creating any chances of note. Cameron Jerome put Norwich in front from close range Norwich always posed a threat though and showed a glimpse of what was to come when they broke out quickly allowing Hoolahan to slip in Jerome with a clever reverse pass. The striker shot into the side netting but when the pair combined again shortly afterwards, the Canaries were in front. Nathan Redmond passed a ball down the right channel to Hoolahan who nicked it past Smith before driving into the box and cutting it back for Jerome to tap into an empty net. Bournemouth responded well and were largely camped in the Norwich half for the rest of the opening period. They could even have been level at the break as Wilson stabbed the ball against the post in stoppage time after Tommy Elphick nodded a deep free-kick into his path. Replays showed, Jerome actually got the slightest touch on Wilson's effort to prevent it from finding the net. The Cherries came out with the same positive approach in the second half but it soon become clear that such an approach would prove to be their downfall. Hoolahan had already been able to break into space and set Jerome up for a shot from 25 yards before he doubled Norwich's lead seven minutes into the second period. Norwich won the ball back in Bournemouth's half, quickly shifted it inside to Hoolahan and the Irishman was able to advance unchallenged to the edge of the area before firing left-footed into the far corner. Norwich City's new signing Matthew Jarvis scored in his sides 3-1 win over Bournemouth and says the victory should drive the team forward. Norwich City's new signing Matthew Jarvis scored in his sides 3-1 win over Bournemouth and says the victory should drive the team forward. With Eddie Howe's side now forced to come forward even more, Norwich were in their element and the final goal came after Jonny Howson stole the ball on the halfway line and ran through with two men in support, he opted to go right to Jarvis and the winger cut back onto his left foot and curled to ball expertly into the far corner beyond the reach of the helpless Artur Boruc. That rather killed the game with almost 25 minutes remaining. Bournemouth, who brought on Glenn Murray to make his debut for the club, continued to try and attack although their belief was visibly deteriorating with every minute that went by. They did manage to pull one back when Cook headed home unmarked after a short corner but there was little to suggest a late revival in the closing stages. Indeed, it was Norwich who almost added a fourth. Another debutant, Dieumerci Mbokani, and Robbie Brady both being denied by Boruc before the final whistle. Soccer Saturday Verdict - Paul Merson Norwich were very good. I was disappointed in Bournemouth, they didn't really get going through any part of the game. They could not stop Wes Hoolahan today. He played in the hole and when you play in that role you have to hurt people, and he did. I forgot about Matt Jarvis, he looked lively and I thought Simon Francis had him but he cut inside and bent a lovely ball into the far corner. Bournemouth will be pulling their hair out and will wonder how they can go and put four by West Ham then today look poor. If you give Bournemouth time on the ball they'll pass it around, they didn't let them do that. They got right in their faces and it's hard for them to pass the ball when they're under pressure. Callum Wilson was isolated and it was a disappointing day for him.

The Nigeria striker, who signed a new five-year deal last week, volleyed home Troy Deeney's header across the box from a long goal-kick forward on 59 minutes - his second of the campaign. But the hosts were made to sweat for 25 minutes after Valon Behrami was shown a straight red card for violent conduct - a stamp on Andre Ayew's left knee midway through a challenge. Bafetimbi Gomis, searching for his fifth goal in five Premier League games, had Swansea's best chance when he forced Heurelho Gomes into a diving save to his left in the first-half. Watford had not scored since Ighalo's last goal - an 83rd-minute strike in the opening day draw against Everton. But he was lively from the off alongside Troy Deeney, and the pair made life difficult for a Swansea side who came into the game unbeaten this season. Hornets centre-back Sebastian Prodl had their first chance, however, firing over the bar from a cleared corner on 10 minutes before Deeney had a shot blocked on the edge of the box. Almen Abdi went close to an opener on 18 minutes when he exchanged passes with Ighalo and saw a deflected shot bounce just past the far post. Swansea hit back and Gomis had two chances to give them the breakthrough; his first effort a swift turn and shot that forced Gomes down low before the keeper beat away a close-range effort as the striker lost his footing. But the score remained goalless at half-time despite Ighalo firing a wicked shot at Lukasz Fabianski from an acute angle from the left. The visitors started the second half brightly but Watford were rewarded for a strong response when Deeney nodded Gomes' long punt forward to an unmarked Ighalo, who slotted home on the hour. Behrami deserved to be dismissed just five minutes later - the midfielder completely missing the ball as Ayew took it away from him before stamping down on the Swansea winger's knee. But Swansea failed to threaten adequately for the remainder of the game, despite manager Garry Monk bringing on Jefferson Montero and Eder. Montero was lively but wasteful in-front of goal, seeing two speculative efforts fly over the bar as well as a third from Federico Fernandez. And Fernandez headed far wide from inside the box as the Swans pushed hard for a leveller in vein at the death. Soccer Saturday Verdict - Charlie Nicholas It was formation that changed Watford's fortunes. It took them ten minutes to settle, Troy Deeney was closer to Odion Ighalo and it made the others get up wide. They are physically strong, quick at the full-back positions. There are times when they didn't get enough bodies into the box but their goal was a long kick out, Deeney knocks it down and three Swansea players don't challenge him. Ighalo finds space right in the penalty box and Deeney just drops it in and Ighalo slides it by the goalkeeper. It was a really cheap goal for Swansea. Garry Monk will be having a go at Swansea tonight. No fluency, disappointing. Jonjo Shelvey didn't get high up the pitch. I don't get what's going on with Gylfi Sigurdsson, who should be feeding off Andre Ayew, and Bafetimbi Gomis. He never got a kick today. Didn't look that interested. Ever so disappointing for Swansea.

Tony Pulis thought his side should have had a penalty after Callum McManaman went down under the challenge of Matt Target in the 16th minute but nothing was given by referee Stuart Attwell. There was a real lack of creativity in attack from both sides but Southampton did manage to create one clear cut opening in the 37th minute as Jay Rodriguez headed Dusan Tadic's cross wide from close range. After the break, Pulis called on Berahino - who saw a proposed move to Tottenham break down on deadline day - in the 55th minute and his appearance received a mixture of boos and cheers from the home fans. However, he could not make the desired impact as both defences continued to dominate in what was a game to forget at the Hawthorns Southampton named Virgil van Dijk - a deadline day signing from Celtic - in their starting line-up for the trip to West Brom and the visitors looked the more lively side in the opening stages with Tadic producing a couple of testing crosses from the right. Callum McManaman comes together with Matt Targett West Brom were struggling to get going in attack but they thought they should have had a penalty when McManaman burst into the box before being felled by Targett inside the area. Despite the strong appeals Attwell remained unmoved and it was Southampton, who looked the more likely to break the deadlock. Tadic - a bright spark in a game lacking creativity - continued to probe as Craig Dawson and Salomon Rondon. Craig Dawson headed over for the hosts but Saints goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg remained untroubled as Van Dijk put in an assured debut alongside Jose Fonte. At the other end Rodriguez should have broken the deadlock in the 37th minute when he got ahead of Dawson but he could not capitalise, heading Tadic's inch-perfect cross wide from six yards. Jose Fonte wins a header above Salomon Rondon. After the break Southampton's dominance continued and Pulis was forced into action as he brought on Berahino, just after Rondon fired over. The England U21 striker received a mixed reception from the home fans but they were nearly celebrating a goal when Maartin Stekelenburg dropped a regulation catch, before gathering on his line at the second attempt. James Ward-Prowse's produced a wayward effort in the 65th minute, while substitue Sadio Mane hit the side netting after bursting into the penalty area 10 minutes later. Southampton's deadline day signing Virgil van Dijk was happy with his debut performance and a clean sheet at West Brom Southampton's deadline day signing Virgil van Dijk was happy with his debut performance and a clean sheet at West Brom Southampton finished on top but in truth they never looked like scoring against a well marshalled West Brom defence, led effectively by Jonny Evans. Soccer Saturday Verdict - Phil Thompson At some point in the first half, it was that quiet in the stadium you could hear Tony Pulis booming instructions because it was that poor. It was like a pre-season game. There were more frightened players, they both backed off defensively leaving a big void in the middle where teams passed away. The only moment in the game that there's any argument about is when Callum McManaman went into the box in an inside position, poked it past Matt Targett, and it looks like he went over it quite easily but there is no other option. To me it was a penalty kick no matter what. Southampton's deadline day signing Virgil van Dijk was happy with his debut performance and a clean sheet at West Brom Southampton's deadline day signing Virgil van Dijk was happy with his debut performance and a clean sheet at West Brom It is almost like a fear factor, West Brom started with Rickie Lambert and Salomon Rondon up front, but they did not want to play anyone in behind. There is no great belief they can go and win games at the moment. It just petered out this game. Everybody groaned at the end it was that poor.

off the bench to score on his debut as Man Utd went second Anthony Martial came off the bench to score on his debut as Man Utd went second Substitute Anthony Martial scored on his Manchester United debut as they beat Liverpool 3-1 to move up to second in the Premier League. Daley Blind gave the hosts the lead shortly after the break, before Ander Herrera converted from the penalty spot after he was brought down by Joe Gomez in the box. Anthony Martial came off the bench to score on his Manchester United debut Christian Benteke pulled one back with a stunning strike, but Martial restored United's two-goal lead with an excellent individual goal. David de Gea returned to the starting line-up, but it was Martial who stole the show with a dream start to his Old Trafford career, and United move up to second place, five points behind leaders Manchester City who maintained their perfect start to the season with victory over Crystal Palace earlier in the day. Daley Blind scored the opening goal in his man of the match performance Daley Blind scored the opening goal in his man of the match performance Louis van Gaal handed De Gea his first start of the season, but Wayne Rooney was absent through injury and the United boss named Marouane Fellaini up front, choosing to leave new signing Martial on the bench. Liverpool set up their stall early, keeping men behind the ball, happy to allow the hosts to keep plenty of possession. Fellaini got the nod up front with Rooney injured The visitors looked nervy on the ball themselves, especially playing it out from the back, and Simon Mignolet nearly caused himself real problems as he attempted to roll the ball out, only to throw it straight against Juan Mata's leg. Fellaini couldn't punish the goalkeeper, though, firing a first-time effort high over the bar with Mignolet still scrambling to find his position. Blind put United in front with a fine strike But it was an opening period devoid of any real chances as Liverpool held the hosts at arm's length, and Van Gaal's men struggled to attack with any real drive or purpose. The game sparked into life right after the break, though, as substitute Ashley Young charged in from the left and won a free kick on the left-hand edge of the box. Mata's low delivery in the 49th minute was met by Blind with a superb first-time strike which flew into the corner. Herrera made it 2-0 from the penalty spot Liverpool responded well to going behind, and Danny Ings almost levelled as he fired a volley into the ground, only to see De Gea turn it behind with a fine save. Soon afterwards, Blind kept his side in front with a vital stop off the line from Martin Skrtel's header before challenging Roberto Firmino at the far post to prevent the Brazilian turning it in. Liverpool's Christian Benteke scored a possible goal of the season with this incredible effort at Old Trafford Liverpool's Christian Benteke scored a possible goal of the season with this incredible effort at Old Trafford Old Trafford roared in unison with 25 minutes to go as Martial was brought on for Mata, with everyone holding high hopes for the world's most expensive teenager. Then, in the 70th minute, United's lead was doubled as Herrera charged into the box before being brought down by Gomez, and the midfielder drilled the resulting penalty into the top corner. Martial celebrates after scoring his first goal for Manchester United Benteke looked to have made things uncomfortable with six minutes of normal time remaining, as he met Blind's looping header with a wonderful acrobatic strike to pull one back. But two minutes later Martial made his mark, picking up Young's pass on the left and producing a mazy dribbling run to dart into the box before he coolly slotted a shot into the bottom corner to cap a dream debut.

Southampton midfielder Victor Wanyama was again left out of the squad, with Koeman insisting he was \"not mentally and physically good enough to play\", with Sky sources reporting last week that was he wanted to leave the south coast club.

Norwich looked to have held on until the break, but Pelle slotted home at the near post 10 yards out from Mane's slipped through ball, despite a hint of offside. Southampton came out in the second half firing, and forced two quick-fire saves from Ruddy. First, Mane stung the hands of the Norwich stopper from 12 yards, before half-time substitute Jay Rodriguez did the same from a volley from 20 yards. Steven Whittaker leaves the field past Alex Neil after being sent off Pelle went close to a second on the hour mark, hitting the side netting with a fierce effort from the edge of the box, but Saints got their second and third in the space of three minutes. Tadic, impressive on the left wing for the hosts, was found at the back post by man of the match Mane, firing past Ruddy from 12 yards for 2-0. Then, with 67 minutes on the clock, the Serbian made it 3-0, tapping in from close range after Pelle's header from a Cedric Soares cross was well saved by Ruddy.

as Swansea came from behind to earn a 2-1 win over Manchester United for the third time in a row. Juan Mata fired the visitors in front shortly after the break, after Gomis had earlier hit the post for Garry Monk's men. But Andre Ayew headed the home side level on the hour mark before Gomis completed the turnaround just a few minutes later. Swansea beat United by the same scoreline in both Premier League meetings last season, and this win moves them above Louis van Gaal's men into fourth place with eight points from their first four fixtures. United - beaten for the first time this season - started quickly and immediately pressed forward as Memphis Depay was fouled by Neil Taylor around 25 yards out, and the Dutchman's low free kick was palmed away by Lukasz Fabianksi. Man Utd boss Louis van Gaal says his side couldn't cope with Swansea changing shape Man Utd boss Louis van Gaal says his side couldn't cope with Swansea changing shape The visitors continued to enjoy more possession but were struggling to find a way through until Ander Herrera found Mata in space, only for the Spaniard to drill wide of the near post. Swansea were growing into the game, though, and had two good chances to take the lead themselves in a frantic couple of minutes. Gomis flicked on Jonjo Shelvey's low free kick, and Gylfi Sigurdsson was on to it quickly, but could only fire inches wide of the far post.

It was United who started the second half strongly, as they did the first, and they were ahead inside 49 minutes as Luke Shaw's chipped cross was left alone by Wayne Rooney and Ashley Williams was caught out by the delivery, with Mata there to fire into the roof of the net from close range. It nearly got worse for Williams shortly afterwards as he stuck out a leg to intercept a Memphis cross only to divert it towards his own net, but Fabianski was alert and managed to parry away. Swansea survived the danger, though, and drew level on the hour mark as Sigurdsson fired in an excellent cross, which was met by a downward header from Ayew before bouncing past Sergio Romero, who let in his first Premier League goal.

Rooney, still looking for his first Premier League goal of the season, had a glorious chance late on as he controlled the ball superbly before bearing down on goal, but the England man hesitated and Williams managed to get back and muscle him off the ball. The forward screamed for a penalty but the referee waved away his appeal, and the hosts held on to earn a third-straight 2-1 win over Van Gaal's men.

"report": "Newcastle 0-1 Arsenal: Aleksandar Mitrovic sent off before Fabricio Coloccini own goal Aleksandar Mitrovic of Newcastle United is shown a red card Arsenal took advantage of Aleksandar Mitrovic's early red card to beat Newcastle 1-0 at St James' Park on Saturday. The Magpies striker, who had been booked in both his previous Premier League matches, was dismissed after just 16 minutes following a high tackle on Francis Coquelin. The hosts managed to hold out until half-time but their resistance was broken in the 52nd minute by an own goal as Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's shot deflected in off Fabricio Coloccini. The goal proved to be decisive as Arsenal dominated possession and never looked in danger of conceding an equaliser. While Newcastle were applauded for their efforts at the final whistle by their fans, they have now not scored in the league since the opening day of the season and have not had a shot on target since August 15. Both sides made three changes to their starting line-ups, with Laurent Koscielny returning for Arsenal in defence, Theo Walcott preferred to Olivier Giroud up front and Oxlade-Chamberlain starting ahead of the injured Mesut Ozil. Florian Thauvin could not find a way past Petr Cech Opposite number Steve McClaren restored the bulk of the men rested for the midweek Capital One Cup cup tie against Northampton and brought in Daryl Janmaat, Florian Thauvin and Moussa Sissoko. But his game-plan was ripped apart within 16 minutes when referee Andre Marriner interpreted Mitrovic's challenge on Coquelin as a red-card offence and dismissed him, much to the Serbia international's astonishment. Moussa Sissoko (left) competes for the ball with Francis Coquelin (middle) The official's standing on Tyneside plummeted further when, having already booked Sissoko for a foul on Nacho Monreal, he swiftly added Chancel Mbemba and Thauvin to his collection. However, he might have angered the locals further had he spotted Thauvin's 13th-minute trip on Hector Bellerin inside the box. With a numerical advantage, Arsenal dominated possession, but only created two clear chances before half-time, both of which were spurned by Walcott. Theo Walcott missed two chances before half-time The England international was first denied by Tim Krul before firing wastefully wide of the target after the Newcastle keeper could only parry Alexis Sanchez's drive 13 minutes before the break. But the Netherlands international was finally beaten seven minutes after the restart when Oxlade-Chamberlain fired a shot across goal and it went in off the post, with the help of a deflection off Coloccini. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (middle) celebrates Arsenal's goal Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (middle) celebrates Arsenal's goal Krul enjoyed better fortune when he pushed away Sanchez's 58th-minute strike from close-range and then claimed Cazorla's snapshot at the second attempt. The Magpies repeatedly tried to hit the visitors on the break with midfielder Thauvin attempting to lead the line, but they found themselves largely camped deep inside their own half and Krul had to deny substitute Giroud, Cazorla and Monreal before his day was done.

The visitors had led through Yann M'Vila's fine early free-kick but though Scott Sinclair's double had put the hosts in the driving seat before the break, Lens' second-half strike ensured the spoils were shared. Jordan Amavi (left) and Idrissa Gueye (right) of Villa block the way of Jeremain Lens Neither side established superiority in midfield initially but Sunderland stole a march in the eighth minute when Jordan Amavi's clumsy foul allowed M'Vila to whip home a dreamy 25-yard set-piece at the near post - leaving Brad Guzan with no chance. The home side's response was impressive, though, and they were level three minutes later when Lee Cattermole bundled Sinclair over at a corner.

Tim Sherwood says his side should have been out of sight by half-time against Sunderland, and that they were robbed of a penalty Tim Sherwood says his side should have been out of sight by half-time against Sunderland, and that they were robbed of a penalty Villa began to assert themselves with some more assured passing and when Sinclair's second arrived four minutes before the interval, it was clinically taken. Amavi - impressive going forward down the left - found the space to race towards the by-line on the counter-attack and provide a pacy low cross for Sinclair, who easily tucked in to the roof of the net from five yards. Leandro Bacuna strides forward for Villa Sunderland manager Dick Advocaat introduced Steven Fletcher and debutant Nils Ola Toivonen at the interval, and the latter had an immediate impact as his size and movement won the visitors some midfield initiative. The on-loan Swede played a key role in the Black Cats' leveller, robbing Carlos Sanchez of possession and feeding the ball out to Lens, who ghosted inside Ciaran Clark's over-zealous challenge and found the middle of the net from 12 yards via a deflection off Micah Richards. It was Villa's turn to respond, and respond they did - spending much of the remainder of the game camped in Sunderland's half. Dick Advocaat admits Villa dominated large periods of their game but the Sunderland boss was pleased his changes earned his side a point Dick Advocaat admits Villa dominated large periods of their game but the Sunderland boss was pleased his changes earned his side a point Probably the hosts' best chance to win the game came just before the hour, when Richards set them in motion with a strong challenge and fed the ball wide before charging in to the box. He met Sinclair's centre when just two yards from goal but could only divert wide. Recent £6m arrival Rudy Gestede, who was largely anonymous in the first half, then spurned several further opportunities to take all three points as he sent a glancing header and a low 18-yard shot the wrong side of the post.

Sunderland came back into it in the second half with the double change a half time but for me it was about missed opportunities for Aston Villa. \"It was a decent game without star quality. I think Dick Advocaat will be chuffed with 2-2. But [Lee] Cattermole - the one they relied upon last season - has been substituted after 30 minutes or so and again at half time for the second.

minutes from time secured a 1-1 draw for Leicester at Bournemouth in a game of few chances. Vardy was fouled in the 85th minute and converted the spot-kick himself as Leicester finished strongly on the south coast. Charlie Daniels moves away from Riyad Mahrez It had appeared that Callum Wilson's superbly-taken goal after 24 minutes would be enough to give the division's newcomers their second successive Premier League win. Wilson fired home an excellent overhead kick after Charlie Daniels' low cross found its way into his path via a deflected Max Gradel header. Bournemouth lost Charlie Daniels, Tyrone Mings and Max Gradel to injury against Leicester and Eddie Howe says it could have cost them the win Bournemouth lost Charlie Daniels, Tyrone Mings and Max Gradel to injury against Leicester and Eddie Howe says it could have cost them the win But Vardy showed good pace to get away from Steve Cook, who tripped him for a penalty which the referee had no hesitation in awarding. The striker, who scored in the Foxes' opening-day win over Sunderland, made no mistake from the 12-yard mark to give his side a point which means they are now third in the table. Bournemouth are 11th. Callum Wilson (right) and Andy King (left) compete for the ball The goals were the only real chances in a game which did little to live up to its pre-match billing as a contest between two in-form teams. Leicester have made a big impact in their three Premier League games this season and good things are increasingly being expected of Bournemouth after their highly encouraging 4-3 win at West Ham last weekend. Both teams played with intensity and energy in the opening 20 minutes but were unable to translate either quality into goalscoring opportunities. Claudio Ranieri was unhappy with his side's reaction to going behind at Bournemouth, but the Leicester boss was pleased with their second-half display Claudio Ranieri was unhappy with his side's reaction to going behind at Bournemouth, but the Leicester boss was pleased with their second-half display Wilson's fine strike was the first of just two shots on target Bournemouth managed all game and it had the twin impact of both settling the match tempo down and rocking Leicester's confidence. It was low-key stuff from that point until around a quarter of an hour from full-time, when the visitors began to press higher up the pitch and with added urgency. Leicester's Jamie Vardy says a 1-1 draw was a fair result against Bournemouth and it keeps their unbeaten run going Leicester's Jamie Vardy says a 1-1 draw was a fair result against Bournemouth and it keeps their unbeaten run going Their midfield player N'Golo Kanté provided plenty of thrust from the centre and Jeffrey Schlupp's piercing runs and crosses from the left wing were the main source of danger to Bournemouth. It seemed the home team had done enough for all three points when Kanté set Vardy free to burst into the box with an acceleration which was his trademark last season. Cook went to ground with a clumsy challenge for a certain foul and Vardy fired home from the spot despite Artur Boruc getting both hands to it.

game as Bakary Sako and Joel Ward earned a shock 2-1 win. Sako, fresh from scoring the winner against Aston Villa last weekend, turned the ball home with 25 minutes remaining of Saturday's Premier League clash after Yannick Bolasie's cut back. Substitute Radamel Falcao headed in Chelsea's equaliser from Pedro's superb cross, but Palace went up the other end and scored through Ward, who headed home Sako's cut back with nine minutes remaining. Bakary Sako scores in front of the Palace fans in the second half The champions, who won their first four games last season, have now taken just four points out of a possible 12, while Palace earned an historic first win at Stamford Bridge since 1982. Chelsea's defeat, only their second at home in the league under Mourinho, means the reigning champions are already eight points behind leaders Manchester City. The hosts were forced into the one change as Gary Cahill replaced the suspended John Terry, and their defence stood tall as Palace threatened on the break in the first half. Radamel Falcao of Chelsea celebrates scoring his first goal for the club Sako forced Thibaut Courtois into a save with his feet as Palace broke, and the visitors should have been ahead just before the half-hour mark. Wilfried Zaha twisted and turned on the left before slipping the ball inside the on-running Yohan Cabaye, but the Frenchman's effort from 15 yards was straight at Courtois, who got down well to scramble clear. For Chelsea, Pedro went close on his home debut after turning inside and curling just wide with his left foot, before Alex McCarthy made a fine double save for Palace. First, the goalkeeper batted clear Diego Costa's low effort in the area, before getting up well to clear Cesc Fabregas' rebound with the help of defender Scott Dann. Diego Costa pushes Damien Delaney in the first half Courtois denied Sako a second time after the break, getting down low to his right to clear a long-range effort, but the summer signing from Wolves got his goal on 65 minutes. Receiving Bolasie's cross, Sako first saw his shot blocked by Cesar Azpilicueta, before reacting quickly to strike the ball high into the goal from 15 yards for 1-0. Mourinho reacted by bringing on Colombian Falcao, who reacted by heading Pedro's cross into the bottom right corner past McCarthy just minutes after Bolasie had missed a clear chance from six yards out at the other end. Bakary Sako opened the scoring in Crystal Palace’s 2-1 win against Chelsea and says he is proving he is capable of making the step up from the Championship Bakary Sako opened the scoring in Crystal Palace’s 2-1 win against Chelsea and says he is proving he is capable of making the step up from the Championship But two minutes after the equaliser Palace got their winner through Ward, who headed in Sako's cut-back on the stretch from six yards. Superb defending from Dann, who blocked Fabregas' effort inside the area in the final moments of the game, saw Palace over the line, and Alan Pardew's side now have nine points from a possible 12 in their opening four games. Gary Cahill is closed down by in Crystal Palace's half SSNHQ's Andy Burton's verdict from Stamford Bridge Remarkably, in Mourinho's 100th Premier League home match as Chelsea manager, he's suffered defeat. It's only the second time he's lost at home in the Premier League, the last time being against Sunderland in April 2014. Palace fans can't believe it, and a small smattering of boos fill the air from the home supporters. This wasn't in the script, but Crystal Palace will feel they deserve it. They were resolute and dogged in the first half, containing and frustrating their hosts, and took their chances in the second. Pardew will be a happy man tonight. Jose, not so much… One thing is for sure, Chelsea's movements in the transfer window between now and Tuesday night will be worth watching. Mourinho says the referee made a ‘huge mistake’ not to award Chelsea a penalty when the score was 0-0 Mourinho says the referee made a ‘huge mistake’ not to award Chelsea a penalty when the score was 0-0 Phil Thompson's Soccer Saturday verdict \"[Branislav] Ivanovic is frightened of anyone with pace, he backs off. [Cesar] Azpilicueta was certainly not at it, he [Jose Mourinho] substituted him. [Nemanja] Matic, one of his leaders on the pitch, was not doing it and he substituted him. Willian was another one that got bought off. So there's a whole host of players there. [Diego] Costa has to realise he can't keep losing his rag with people. \"They had the chances but there is something wrong. It's like a complacency about a lot of these players.

and end their hosts' unbeaten start to the season. Goals from Manuel Lanzini, Mark Noble and Diafra Sakho secured a famous victory, which also featured controversial red cards for Philippe Coutinho and Noble. Lanzini put West Ham ahead early on Slaven Bilic's side – who defeated Arsenal at the Emirates on the opening day – were ahead after just three minutes when Lanzini tucked in at the back post – the first goal Liverpool have conceded this season. Roberto Firmino almost hit an immediate response, smashing a drive against the woodwork, but West Ham doubled their advantage on 29 minutes when Noble coolly slotted in after Lanzini had robbed Dejan Lovren of the ball by the corner flag. Slaven Bilic highlighted West Ham’s organisation as the main factor behind his side's win Slaven Bilic highlighted West Ham’s organisation as the main factor behind his side's win Liverpool's afternoon got worse on 53 minutes when Coutinho was sent off after picking up an unfortunate second yellow card, and, although Noble was later shown a straight red in bizarre circumstances, Sakho added a third in injury-time as West Ham secured three points at Anfield for the first time since 1963. West Ham had lost to Leicester City and Bournemouth after shocking Arsenal and, with no victories in 19 Premier League visits to Anfield, seemed to be facing a tough task against Brendan Rodgers' men, who impressed on their own trip to the Emirates on Monday night. However, the visitors were celebrating with just three minutes on the clock after Lanzini pipped Joe Gomez to Aaron Cresswell's cross, after Martin Skrtel had only half-cleared Dimitri Payet's centre. Brendan Rodgers believes conceding an early goal was pivotal in Liverpool’s 3-0 loss to The Hammers Brendan Rodgers believes conceding an early goal was pivotal in Liverpool’s 3-0 loss to The Hammers Liverpool were almost back on level terms on seven minutes when Firmino unleashed a fierce, swerving effort from 35 yards, but the ball rebounded back into play off the post. That was as good as it got for Liverpool in the opening 45; the Reds struggled to unlock West Ham's resolute defence and Bilic's side repeatedly threatened on the break. First Lanzini fired wide after a quick break up field, before Cresswell shot tamely over the bar from the edge of the box on 24 minutes. Mark Noble doubled the visitors' lead West Ham's second came courtesy of an error from Lovren. Harried by Lanzini, the defender had ample opportunity to clear for a throw-in, but was eventually robbed of the ball, allowing the Argentine to tee-up Noble for a smart finish. Coutinho, who had picked up a yellow card just before half-time for stopping a West Ham counter-attack, was then dismissed less than 10 minutes into the second period for a foul on Payet. The Brazilian slid in to tackle the West Ham midfielder but a smart pirouette from Payet meant Coutinho took down his man – and collected a somewhat harsh second yellow card. Martin Skrtel tackles Cheikhou Kouyate Christian Benteke saw an effort blocked and James Milner dragged a shot wide as 10-man Liverpool searched for a way back into the match. Liverpool's cause was helped when Noble was sent off on 78 minutes – however, the West Ham midfielder appeared to be extremely hard done by. Referee Kevin Friend blew for a foul on Noble as he tried to clear the ball from the edge of his box, however, Noble continued to slide in and beat Danny Ings to the loose ball and was given his marching orders as a result. Mark Noble says the referee was wrong to send him off for a challenge on Danny Ings during West Ham’s 3-0 win over Liverpool at Anfield Mark Noble says the referee was wrong to send him off for a challenge on Danny Ings during West Ham’s 3-0 win over Liverpool at Anfield Liverpool failed to capitalise on the decision, though – Lovren was unable to divert Benteke's header goalwards and Pedro Obiang twice blocked Ings efforts – and it was West Ham who put the game beyond doubt in injury time. Sakho was allowed to advance on Liverpool's goal and slide a low shot past Mignolet to wrap up another massive away win for West Ham. Matt Le Tissier's Soccer Saturday verdict Matt Le Tissier believes Liverpool paid a dear price for a poor performance from their defence Matt Le Tissier believes Liverpool paid a dear price for a poor performance from their defence \"Liverpool forgot how to defend.They were so poor when the ball was put into the box. There were a lot of times when they had time to just clear it and their headers never had any distance, never had any height. \"They have invested in Benteke but they are not playing football that suits Christian Benteke's game. The service is not what he probably had at Aston Villa. He had so much more service into the right areas of the box than what he has at Liverpool. \"He had one glancing header with about a couple of minutes of stoppage time remaining and that was it.

Sterling fired the hosts in front early in the second half on Saturday after they struggled to find a way through in the opening period, despite dominating proceedings. Fernandinho's fine strike then gave Manuel Pellegrini's men a comfortable cushion as they strolled to their fourth victory in succession to maintain their perfect start. Sterling finally broke the deadlock inside two minutes of the restart City have yet to concede in 360 minutes of Premier League football this season and they keep their place at the top of the table after another strong performance, while opening up an eight-point gap over reigning champions Chelsea. The opening stages were played almost exclusively in the Watford half, but the defence was standing firm as the hosts dominated possession. After being held for a long time by Watford, City boss Pellegrini was happy with his side after they scored two goals in the second half After being held for a long time by Watford, City boss Pellegrini was happy with his side after they scored two goals in the second half The first half-chance of the match came at the other end, though, as Sebastian Prodl had two bites at a Watford corner, but his first attempt was blocked before his second deflected wide. City eventually managed to convert their domination into an opening, but Sterling's shot was diverted off target after an excellent last-ditch challenge by Craig Cathcart.

Sergio Aguero was kept fairly quiet in the opening period, but though he went close after good work by Fernandinho to win the ball, he could only fire his 20-yard strike wide of the target. Quique Sanchez Flores was happy with how his Watford played against City, despite losing 2-0 Quique Sanchez Flores was happy with how his Watford played against City, despite losing 2-0 Pellegrini threw on Samir Nasri for Jesus Navas at the break but it was Bacary Sagna who had the impact down the right as he set up City's opener within two minutes of the restart. The defender fired in a superb cross and Sterling beat the offside trap, meeting the ball completely unmarked and placing a low volley past Gomes to open his account for his new club. Fernandinho put the hosts out of reach in the 56th minutes Watford immediately looked to change their tactics with Troy Deeney – deployed wide on the right from the start – was moved to a more conventional central position. But on 56 minutes the hosts doubled their lead after Yaya Toure's free kick hit the wall, Watford failed to clear properly and Fernandinho played a neat one-two with David Silva before firing a powerful shot into the corner. City captain Vincent Kompany is delighted with the club's start to the season, with four wins out of four City captain Vincent Kompany is delighted with the club's start to the season, with four wins out of four With the result seemingly wrapped up, City eased off but still looked threatening whenever they came forward. Sterling played a square ball to Aguero, but the striker could only scuff a shot from 12 yards out. Toure also went close, meeting Aleksandar Kolarov's low ball before firing a first-time effort just wide of the upright, while Nasri saw a long-range strike saved by Gomes.

Ibrahim Afellay and Charlie Adam were given straight red cards as West Brom took advantage to win 1-0 and earn their first Premier League victory of the season. Salomon Rondon handed his manager Tony Pulis a successful return to his former club by scoring the only goal in first-half stoppage time, when Stoke had already been reduced to nine men for a pair of separate violent conduct offences. The game hinged on the two red-card decisions by referee Michael Oliver within seven minutes of each other for the home side. Firstly, after 25 minutes, an innocuous-looking foul from Craig Gardner on Afellay around the half-way mark turned ugly. The ex-Barcelona midfielder, frustrated at having his progress halted, flicked his hand towards Gardner's face when he returned to his feet. West Brom's Darren Fletcher and Rickie Lambert were both happy after their side's 1-0 win over Stoke West Brom's Darren Fletcher and Rickie Lambert were both happy after their side's 1-0 win over Stoke After taking a few moments to book Gardner, Oliver gave Afellay his marching orders and he would be joined in the changing room by a team-mate shortly after. Adam and Craig Dawson clashed near the touchline, immediately prompting the assistant referee's frantic flag-waving. Oliver consulted with him and concluded that Adam stamped on his grounded opponent, and he was also red carded much to Stoke's chagrin. Charlie Adam walks off the pitch after being shown a red card, leaving Stoke down to nine men Baggies boss Pulis reacted by immediately whipping off his holding midfielder, Claudio Yacob, and sending Rickie Lambert on to further harm depleted Stoke. Pulis was unable to call upon Saido Berahino, who missed a third straight match having handed in a transfer request after Tottenham's two failed bids. Stoke's Jack Butland was left frustrated after two red cards hampered their chances of their first victory this season Stoke's Jack Butland was left frustrated after two red cards hampered their chances of their first victory this season The veteran Lambert made a quick impact by twice shooting from distance and forcing Jack Butland into saves before setting up the opening goal. The Potters, forced further and further towards their own goal, were desperate to head into the break goalless but were thwarted in the final moments when Lambert picked up possession outside the box. Salomon Rondon of West Brom celebrates scoring at Stoke Rondon, the Baggies' £12m summer recruit, peeled away to the far post and guided Lambert's cross past the despairing Butland. The whistle sounded soon after, to leave Mark Hughes looking furious on the touchline. West Brom tried to turn the screw in the second half but, with Stoke forced to sit deep, rarely threatened to have the quality required to hurt the hosts. West Brom manager Tony Pulis returned to his old side Stoke for the first time on Saturday and secured a 1-0 victory West Brom manager Tony Pulis returned to his old side Stoke for the first time on Saturday and secured a 1-0 victory Their best chance may have been within moments of the restart when Rondon found the roof of the net with a looping header. After 51 minutes, the Venezuelan nodded a corner feebly wide before Darren Fletcher's 20-yard drive almost ricocheted into the bottom corner. Stoke, reduced to a puncher's chance, gamely counter-attacked through Xherdan Shaqiri, their gifted home debutant who displayed flashes of his skill but frequently had too large a task. Stoke manager Mark Hughes thinks that Charlie Adam stepped on Craig Dawson in their clash, rather than stamped on him Stoke manager Mark Hughes thinks that Charlie Adam stepped on Craig Dawson in their clash, rather than stamped on him The hosts' best opportunity was a stoppage-time free-kick from 25 yards which Marko Arnautovic weakly struck into the grateful wall of defenders.

"Arsenal 0-0 Liverpool: Gunners wait for first home league win goes on Alexis Sanchez is closed down by Liverpool's Martin Skrtel Arsenal and Liverpool played out a thrilling goalless draw on Monday night as the home side's wait for a first Premier League win at the Emirates this season continues. It was a game of two halves, with the visitors dominating the opening period, only to be denied on several occasions by the brilliance of Arsenal goalkeeper Petr Cech. However, Arsene Wenger's team took control of proceedings after half-time, with only the woodwork and some near misses denying them a first league goal at home this season. Arsenal were forced to make two changes from the side that beat Crystal Palace last time out, with centre-backs Per Mertesacker and Laurent Koscielny both missing through illness and a back injury respectively. And to cover that huge hole in the back, Wenger opted to give Calum Chambers his first start of the campaign alongside Gabriel in an unfamiliar-looking partnership. Liverpool, though, were also missing two key players, with captain Jordan Henderson and fellow midfielder Adam Lallana out injured, with Lucas Leiva and Emre Can replacing them, while Roberto Firmino was also handed his Reds debut following his big-money move from Hoffenheim in the summer. Olivier Giroud and James Milner battle for the ball However, it was the Reds who could have taken an early lead after a lovely passing move involving captain James Milner and Christian Benteke, with the Belgium international picking out the onrushing Philippe Coutinho, only for the playmaker's shot to crash against the underside of the bar and bounce to safety. That warning shot appeared to stir Arsenal into life, with the hosts responding by very nearly opening the scoring just minutes later through Aaron Ramsey, who had the ball in the back of the net. Arsene Wenger was left disappointed by Aaron Ramsey's disallowed goal, but praised his side's performance Arsene Wenger was left disappointed by Aaron Ramsey's disallowed goal, but praised his side's performance However, the Welshman's effort was ruled out for offside, although on closer inspection it should have stood, with the player level as he was played through on goal down the right-hand side of Liverpool's penalty area. Thereafter, though, it was all Liverpool as a combination of nervousness in the home defence, and some slick passing and interplay from the visitors' forward players, cut Arsenal to ribbons, with only Cech keeping them in the contest at the break. Brendan Rodgers felt his Liverpool side deserved more than a point following the goalless draw with Arsenal Brendan Rodgers felt his Liverpool side deserved more than a point following the goalless draw with Arsenal Several times the experienced shot stopper prevented Liverpool from scoring, most impressively when the 'keeper denied Benteke from opening the scoring with a brilliant point-blank save just before the interval. Petr Cech saves from a close-range Christian Benteke shot Liverpool will have felt hard done by not to have gone in leading at the break, especially after Coutinho produced a moment of brilliance a minute before half-time, only for the Brazilian's curling effort from the left-hand edge of the area to be tipped on to the post by the impressive Cech. However, after half-time it was Arsenal who stepped up the pace, no doubt with their manager's words still ringing in their ears, and Wenger will no doubt feel his team should have taken all three points given their second-half exertions. Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet gives his thoughts on the goalless draw with Arsenal Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet gives his thoughts on the goalless draw with Arsenal Alexis Sanchez was unlucky on the hour-mark when his near-post shot from a tight angle struck the outside of Mignolet's post, after the Chile international had been slipped through by Olivier Giroud. Meanwhile, Giroud himself was also unfortunate on two occasions not to get a touch to balls fizzed across the Liverpool six-yard box, although it was the Frenchman who wasted the best opening of the second period 20 minutes from time. Jamie Carragher compares the performances of Simon Mignolet and Petr Cech during Arsenal and Liverpool's goalless draw Jamie Carragher compares the performances of Simon Mignolet and Petr Cech during Arsenal and Liverpool's goalless draw Faced with only Mignolet to beat from close range, the striker appeared to slip while taking his shot, but the Liverpool 'keeper still needed to be at his best to turn his effort behind for a corner. And while both sides had half chances late on to steal a win, a draw was perhaps the right result given their respective halves.

Chelsea's new signing Pedro had an instant impact when he scored one and made another in the 3-2 victory over West Brom Chelsea's new signing Pedro had an instant impact when he scored one and made another in the 3-2 victory over West Brom Costa doubled Chelsea's lead 10 minutes later before Morrison made amends for his earlier miss, making it 2-1 on 35 - only for Cesar Azpilicueta to restore the Blues' two-goal lead three minutes before the break. Chelsea looked to be in command until Terry was sent off for bringing down Salomon Rondon on the edge of the box on 54 minutes, before Morrison scored again five minutes later to cause Jose Mourinho - who spent the final minutes crouched pensively on the touchline - some late nerves. Referee Mark Clattenburg shows the red card to John Terry However, Chelsea managed to hold on to record their first win of the season, but this encounter provided further evidence that retaining their title, even with Pedro firing on all cylinders, will be anything but easy. Pedro started for the Blues just days after joining from Barcelona, with Saido Berahino left out of the matchday squad for West Brom amid speculation he could be about to sign for Tottenham. New signing Pedro scored on his debut as Chelsea won 3-2 at West Brom, their first victory of the season New signing Pedro scored on his debut as Chelsea won 3-2 at West Brom, their first victory of the season Costa, who looked back to his menacing self, could have opened the scoring after just six minutes, but he dragged wide from a good position. Just five minutes later however, Morrison had a fantastic opportunity to break the deadlock from the penalty spot, after Nemanja Matic had brought down Callum McManaman in the box. Thibaut Courtois dives to save a James Morrison penalty Not normally the penalty taker, Morrison took the ball from Chris Brunt and hit it hard down the middle of the goal, but saw his attempt saved by the legs of Thibaut Courtois, back in the Chelsea side after suspension. The Baggies were made to pay minutes later with new-boy Pedro making an immediate impact on his debut. Speaking after the 3-2 home defeat to Chelsea, West Brom manager Tony Pulis claimed he is in the market for players Speaking after the 3-2 home defeat to Chelsea, West Brom manager Tony Pulis claimed he is in the market for players The Spain forward carried the ball towards the edge of the box, cut inside, before firing past Boaz Myhill, via a slight deflection, to give the visitors the lead. Pedro then turned provider for Costa, firing across goal for the striker to divert home to put the Blues in command. Tony Pulis' side eventually got a reward for their endeavours on 35 minutes, with Morrison drilling the ball home after debutant Rondon had brilliantly kept a deep cross alive. James Morrison gives West Brom hope by making it 2-1 However, Chelsea quickly restored their two-goal lead, with Azpilicueta latching onto a loose ball after Costa had chested a lofted centre down, to score his first goal for the club. After the interval, Chelsea seemed comfortable until Terry was adjudged to be the last man and was given his marching orders. The Blues skipper was struggling to keep pace with the energetic Rondon, and tugged the Baggies' record signing back before he could reach the box, and was handed a straight red. Jose Mourinho refused to comment on the decision to send John Terry off, instead focusing on Chelsea's good performance in the 3-2 win at West Brom Jose Mourinho refused to comment on the decision to send John Terry off, instead focusing on Chelsea's good performance in the 3-2 win at West Brom The hosts grew in confidence as a result, and closed the gap just before the hour mark, with Morrison again getting on the scoresheet, this time with his head, converting a pinpoint McManaman cross. Costa almost made the result safe following more brilliant work from Pedro, but he fired just wide with Myhill beaten. McManaman curled just past the post before a frantic final 15 minutes saw both sides have chances to score, but the Blues held on for a vital three points, and showed some much-needed resilience to silence some of the doubters.

David Silva fired against the post early in the second half Seamus Coleman fired wide from 20 yards while Sterling saw a low effort saved from a similar position at the other end as both sides continued to press for an opener. And Everton were so close to going into the break with a lead after Tom Cleverley was felled on the edge of the box by Fernandinho, before Lukaku's free kick hit the bar and flicked over. Manchester City manager Maunel Pellegrini praised his side's performance against Everton Manchester City manager Maunel Pellegrini praised his side's performance against Everton City came out of the blocks quicker in the second half, and almost broke the deadlock after good work by Sterling, who found Silva in the box, and the Spaniard drilled against Howard's near post. Just as Everton were growing back into the match, City struck a key blow on the hour as Sterling again picked the ball up on the left and drifted inside before finding Kolarov on the overlap, and the defender drilled a low shot from a tight angle which flew past Howard and into the far corner. Samir Nasri made it 2-0 to the visitors late on The visitors should have been out of sight just a few minutes later, when Navas profited from a clash between John Stones and Tyias Browning to run into the box unchallenged, but the winger hesitated and ended up firing a shot straight at Howard. Martinez's men had a strong penalty appeal turned down as they looked for a way back into the game, but Yaya Toure's clumsy challenge on Jagielka went unpunished. Hart had a lucky escape as well when he flapped at an Everton corner, but it didn't quite fall for an attacking player, while Vincent Kompany cleared Gareth Barry's header off the line. Everton's Seamus Coleman conceded Man City were more clinical in front of goal, and hopes John Stones stays at Goodison Everton's Seamus Coleman conceded Man City were more clinical in front of goal, and hopes John Stones stays at Goodison But the hosts couldn't make their pressure tell and City sealed the result in the 88th minute, when substitute Nasri played the ball to Toure on the edge of the box, and the Ivorian returned it to him with a stunning chip over the top before Nasri lifted the ball beyond Howard to score City's second. It moves City back to the Premier League summit and maintains their 100 per cent record in an impressive start to the season.

The Hornets had the two best openings of the match, however, with forward Odion Ighalo and midfielder Etienne Capoue both failing to hit the target from close range. And that means a second consecutive 0-0 draw at home for Watford, while the visitors will have been pleased to have recorded their first clean sheet of the campaign. Troy Deeney says Watford are dominating games but need to find the goals to match their play Troy Deeney says Watford are dominating games but need to find the goals to match their play Hornets boss Quique Sanchez Flores resisted the temptation to hand debuts to new signings Miguel Britos, Giedrius Arlauskis and Nathan Ake, although the first two were on the bench. Meanwhile, his opposite number Ronald Koeman opted to start with both Victor Wanyama and Saido Mane in midfield, despite recent transfer speculation surrounding the pair. Victor Wanyama and Alessandro Diamanti tussle for the ball However, the latter's involvement in the game lasted just 25 minutes before the winger was forced to leave the action with concussion, a blow for the visitors given Mane, with his pace and direct running, had been their most dangerous player in the opening quarter of the match. The Saints had opted to switch to a back three for this contest as Koeman went in search of the club's first Premier League win of the season, while Watford also tried to play a more direct game as their back four looked to find striker Graziano Pelle at any opportunity with the long ball. Southampton's Jose Fonte was pleased to keep a clean sheet but was disappointed with the result at Watford Southampton's Jose Fonte was pleased to keep a clean sheet but was disappointed with the result at Watford But while Southampton looked more comfortable in possession of the ball than their newly promoted opponents, Watford goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes was barely called upon to make a save in the opening 45 minutes. In fact, it was the home team who had the best opening of the half when five minutes before half-time, Ighalo failed to hit the target from just a few yards out after a swift counterattack involving Troy Deeney and Ikechi Anya, although Southampton defender Steven Caulker deserved credit for putting his opponent off at the back post. Steven Davis runs towards Watford defender Allan Nyom The first 45 minutes was perhaps best summed up by Watford committing two foul throws, so it was no surprise that Flores decided to bring on Italy forward Alessandro Diamanti at the break for his first Premier League appearance for five years. However, it was Southampton that came closest to opening the scoring after half-time, first when Pelle's fierce drive was pushed over by Gomes, before substitute Shane Long was only just off target with a near-post header from the resulting corner. Watford manager Quique Sanchez Flores admitted his side found it tough to break down Southampton Watford manager Quique Sanchez Flores admitted his side found it tough to break down Southampton But as the game wore on and became more and more stretched, it was actually the Hornets who looked the more likely winners as Anya's influence on the right flank grew. And Watford really should have broken the deadlock midway through the second half when Deeney got a near-post flick on to a right-wing corner, only for Capoue to somehow place his header at the far post over the bar from virtually on the goal-line for one of the misses of the season. Southampton's Senegalese midfielder Sadio Mane shoots past Watford's Craig Cathcart Thereafter, both teams appeared happy to settle for a point, with Saints centre-back Jose Fonte a rock at the back throughout for the visitors, meaning Watford having now marked their return to the Premier League with three successive draws.

"report": "Wayne Rooney has an early goal disallowed for offside. Wayne Rooney had a goal controversially disallowed for offside as Newcastle held Manchester United to a 0-0 at Old Trafford. The linesman's flag cut short Rooney's celebrations on three minutes after he had got behind the Newcastle defence and finished past Tim Krul. Aleksandar Mitrovic, on his first start for Newcastle, hit the crossbar before Javier Hernandez was denied by Krul and Chris Smalling hit the post in stoppage time. The result means the hosts remain unbeaten and have yet to concede a league goal this season. Louis van Gaal handed a first full start to Bastian Schweinsteiger, who replaced Michael Carrick while Newcastle made three changes to the side that were beaten at Swansea. Luke Shaw of Manchester United and Gabriel Obertan of Newcastle compete for the ball. It was Van Gaal's side that started much the brighter and they had the ball in the net within four minutes. Rooney wheeled away in celebration as he thought he'd ended his nine-game goal drought after slotting past Krul from Adnan Januzaj's pass, but he was flagged offside despite appearing to be level with the Newcastle defence. The early pressure from the hosts was relentless but Newcastle weathered the storm with Krul making a smart low save from Juan Mata on 17 minutes. Memphis Depay is tackled by Fabricio Coloccini Mitrovic, a summer signing from Anderlecht, almost marked his first start for the Magpies with a goal but his header from a Chancel Mbemba cross rocketed back off the crossbar on 23 minutes. Van Gaal's side struggled to inject any pace into their passing in the early stages of the second period as the home fans started to become slightly frustrated with their side. The arrival of Hernandez from the bench sparked the hosts into life and he should have scored on 79 minutes but Krul was quick out of his goal to make a crucial block. Wayne Rooney has a shot at goal Newcastle sank deeper and deeper as the match wore on but the Red Devils just couldn't find a way through as Steven Taylor and Fabricio Coloccini made some superb blocks. Smalling did breach the Newcastle back-line in stoppage time, meeting a Memphis Depay corner with a firm header but with Krul beaten the ball cannoned back off the post. Newcastle nearly took all three points from the resulting counter attack as Newcastle's new signing Florian Thauvin, who came off the bench in the latter stages, was inches away from turning in a Papiss Cisse cross.

Sako scores Crystal Palace's winning goal against Aston Villa Bakary Sako's last-gasp goal gave Crystal Palace a 2-1 victory over Aston Villa at Selhurst Park on Saturday. The Mali international hit a winner three minutes from time on his Palace debut after the match had appeared to be heading for a draw. Palace defender Scott Dann had headed his side in front after 71 minutes, only for the visitors to draw level when Pape Souare turned in debutant Adama Traore's cross six minutes later. Eagles boss Alan Pardew made two changes from the side that lost to Arsenal last weekend, with the injured Conor Wickham being replaced in attack by Glenn Murray, while Sako came in for Yannick Bolasie. Villa, meanwhile, made three alterations from the team that went down 1-0 at home to Manchester United last Friday night, with boss Tim Sherwood opting to bench Scott Sinclair, Jordan Veretout and Jordan Ayew, with Jack Grealish, Rudy Gestede and Carlos Sanchez taking their places in the starting lineup. Scott Dann of Crystal Palace heads to score his team's first goal against Aston Villa And it was Grealish who stamped his authority on proceedings in the first half, with the 19-year-old not looking like a player taking part in his first game of the season after a recent ankle injury. In fact, the visitors really should have been ahead on the quarter-hour mark after an inch-perfect through-ball from Ashley Westwood found Gabriel Agbonlahor breaking clear of a flat-looking Palace back line. However, with just Alex McCarthy to beat, the Villa forward shot wastefully straight at the stand-in Eagles goalkeeper when it seemed easier to score, a miss that seemed to breathe new life into the home side. Bakary Sako’s last-gasp strike gave Crystal Palace a 2-1 win over Aston Villa at Selhurst Park on Saturday Bakary Sako’s last-gasp strike gave Crystal Palace a 2-1 win over Aston Villa at Selhurst Park on Saturday Thereafter in the opening period it was Palace who dominated possession and territory, without ever truly testing Brad Guzan in the visitors' goal, with the closest they came to breaking the deadlock being a speculative long-range effort from Sako that the United States international gathered with ease. Villa were content to play on the counter-attack, and in Grealish they had just the man for that type of game. The 19-year-old was a constant threat with his accurate passing and constant probings, and was only denied a goal on his comeback by McCarthy's excellent near-post block. However, Pardew reacted to his side's lacklustre opening period by making a double change at the break, introducing both Dwight Gayle and Gordon Mutch in place of Wilfried Zaha and Murray, with the changes appearing to have an immediate effect on the hosts' attacking endeavours. Crystal Palace boss Alan Pardew praised his players after a hard fought win against Aston Villa Crystal Palace boss Alan Pardew praised his players after a hard fought win against Aston Villa And but for an excellent point-blank save at his near post by Guzan, Sako would have put Palace in front just a minute into the second half, after good work by Mutch down the Eagles' right flank. Palace thought they had taken the lead on the hour-mark, only for James McArthur's effort to be correctly ruled out for offside after the midfielder had diverted Gayle's shot past Guzan from six yards out. Referee Keith Stroud had initially given the goal, only to then disallow it following consultation with his fourth official after thinking that McArthur had not got a touch to Gayle's effort. The home team's disappointment was short lived, though, as Dann rose powerfully at the back post to power Jason Puncheon's left-wing corner into the back of the net to hand Palace a deserved lead. Aston Villa boss Tim Sherwood was disappointed with his sides 2-1 defeat against Crystal Palace Aston Villa boss Tim Sherwood was disappointed with his sides 2-1 defeat against Crystal Palace Villa boss Sherwood reacted to falling behind by introducing winger Traore, recently signed from Barcelona, for the final 20 minutes and the youngster made an immediate impact by helping to create his side's equaliser. Showing great pace and skill, Traore broke clear down Villa's right flank, before seeing his centre diverted past McCarthy at his near post by Palace left-back Souare. However, if Villa thought they had secured themselves a draw, they were mistaken as Palace took full advantage of Jordan Amavi losing possession of the ball to Dann in the left-back position, and the centre back then fed Sako on the edge of the area, before Palace's new boy made no mistake with a thumping effort that screamed past Guzan.

Mahrez continued his fine scoring run for Leicester Riyad Mahrez continued his fine scoring run as his equaliser earned Leicester a 1-1 draw against Tottenham. The 24-year-old netted his fourth goal of the season just 90 seconds after Dele Alli had put Tottenham in front. Mahrez was denied a strong penalty shout in the first half and hit the post after the break before netting his side's equaliser. The result means the Foxes couldn't register wins in their opening three top-flight fixtures for the first time in their history, but they maintain their unbeaten start to the season. Claudio Ranieri named the same XI that beat West Ham last time out, and his side shaded the opening stages before Marc Albrighton had the first meaningful chance of the match, cutting in from the left and firing an effort just off target. Dele Alli put Spurs in front with nine minutes remaining Tottenham had more of the possession as the half wore on, but they were struggling to create any clear openings as Leicester kept men behind the ball. Moussa Dembele looked lively for the visitors, and he tested Kasper Schmeichel with a dangerous low shot from 25 yards which the goalkeeper managed to parry away. Shortly before the break Mahrez - looking to make an impact for the third game in a row - had a strong penalty appeal turned down as he went down under pressure from Jan Vertonghen. The Spurs defender appeared to have hold of his opponent's shirt, but referee Martin Atkinson didn't deem the contact worthy of awarding a spot kick. The game picked up after the break, and Tottenham nearly took the lead as Kyle Walker played Nacer Chadli in behind, but the midfielder could only blast over from close range. Leicester went close themselves around 10 minutes into the second half, when Mahrez found Danny Drinkwater with a pass from the flank, but the Foxes midfielder could only drill into the side netting. Harry Kane endured a frustrating afternoon up front It was starting to look like it wasn't going to be Mahrez's afternoon, especially when he again darted into the box but could only fire a low shot against the near post. And with nine minutes remaining it looked to have got worse for Leicester, as Harry Kane found Chadli on the left and he chipped a ball across the box before Alli met it with a simple headed finish at the far post to put Spurs in front. But the lead was eradicated almost instantly as Mahrez registered his fourth goal in three games less than 90 seconds later. Ryan Mason was disappointed after Tottenham failed to hold onto their lead against Leicester Ryan Mason was disappointed after Tottenham failed to hold onto their lead against Leicester Jamie Vardy flicked a header down the flank, and Mahrez once again managed to cut inside before firing a superb left-footed shot into the far corner. Mahrez was involved again as the hosts had a glorious chance to win it late on. He fired in a superb cross from the left which was met with a powerful header by Wes Morgan, but it was straight at Hugo Lloris, who managed to parry it away as the game finished level. Matt Le Tissier says Riyad Mahrez was at the heart of everything good about Leicester’s play in their 1-1 draw with Spurs. Matt Le Tissier says Riyad Mahrez was at the heart of everything good about Leicester’s play in their 1-1 draw with Spurs. Soccer Saturday verdict - Matt Le Tissier From what I saw, Leicester should have had a penalty. Vertonghen was fortunate to get away with it,. He got sucked into the challenge and caught him and I thought it was penalty. To be fair to Spurs they had a lot more possession. In the first half they were very predictable, Harry Kane hardly got a touch in the first half, he hardly got a sniff on goal and had one half-chance in the second half. They did have a great deal of possession but didn't hurt Leicester. Most things that were good about Leicester came through Mahrez. He is so lively at the minute, coming in from the right onto his left foot and that is exactly how the goal came about.

Attacking midfielder Xherdan Shaqiri made his debut for Stoke and impressed after his big-money move from Inter but Butland was the key man for the visitors, producing some fabulous saves in the second half. Mame Biram Diouf gave Stoke a first-half lead from a Shaqiri free-kick but Russell Martin levelled for Norwich just before the half-hour. The hosts then produced a fantastic second-half display but a series of chances went begging as they narrowly failed to make it back-to-back Premier League wins. Xherdan Shaqiri made a promising start to his Stoke career Stoke made a composed start in the baking Norfolk heat and took the lead in the 11th minute. Shaqiri whipped over a lovely free-kick from the right and, having eluded marker Alexander Tettey, Diouf was all alone at the back post to skilfully find the net with a stooping header. Norwich responded well to the setback and Butland raced out of his goal to smother a Steven Whittaker effort after a great pass from Graham Dorrans, while Nathan Redmond and Tettey were wide with shots from distance. Russell Martin says he’s frustrated that Norwich didn’t take maximum points against Stoke in their 1-1 draw Russell Martin says he’s frustrated that Norwich didn’t take maximum points against Stoke in their 1-1 draw The heat was so intense that the players took a well-deserved drinks break after 25 minutes and Norwich grabbed an equaliser three minutes later. It looked like they had been denied when Butland somehow kept out Martin's stretching volley from a Robbie Brady free-kick but Redmond hooked the ball back into the box and this time Martin put a low shot through the Stoke goalkeeper's legs. Diouf then had a goal correctly disallowed for offside after a poor clearance from Norwich goalkeeper John Ruddy, but the hosts began to take charge after that and they squandered a string of opportunities at the start of the second half. Mark Hughes praised Jack Butland’s performance following Stoke’s 1-1 draw away to Norwich Mark Hughes praised Jack Butland’s performance following Stoke’s 1-1 draw away to Norwich Cameron Jerome was put clean through on goal by an excellent Jonny Howson pass but shot wide of the target and an unmarked Wes Hoolahan was off-target with a glancing header from a Brady cross. Dorrans did better with a well-struck shot from the edge of the box but Butland got a fingertip to it and that was just enough to divert the ball onto the outside of the post. And another fantastic save soon followed, as the ball fell very kindly for Redmond and he sent a shot arrowing towards the bottom corner, only for Butland to tip it past the post. Alex Neil praised his players' work-ethic during Norwich’s 1-1 draw with Stoke, and says he believes his side deserved all three points Alex Neil praised his players' work-ethic during Norwich’s 1-1 draw with Stoke, and says he believes his side deserved all three points Stoke were still actively seeking a winner themselves but Glenn Johnson and Diouf both dallied when they could have let fly. And Butland was back in Superman mode for the final 10 minutes, keeping out another Dorrans piledriver and then managing to get in the way when Jerome connected well with a close range overhead kick. Russell Martin celebrates after scoring his equaliser for Norwich at Carrow Road A dramatic tussle then finished with both sides squandering wonderful chances to win it, Joselu shooting over the bar from close range after a Stoke free-kick before his fellow sub Bradley Johnson arrived at the back post to meet a set-piece at the other end, only to volley over the top. Although they will be disappointed not to have won, Norwich have made a solid start to life back in the top flight and are eighth in the standings with four points, while Stoke still await their first victory of the season, having drawn two and lost one of their first three fixtures. However, before fading a little in the second half, Shaqiri caught the eye with his quick feet and clever passing, and Stoke fans will feel they have a lot to look forward to from him. Paul Merson believes Norwich must start to make their chances count if they’re to remain in the Premier League Paul Merson believes Norwich must start to make their chances count if they’re to remain in the Premier League Soccer Saturday verdict - Paul Merson Shaqiri did alright. Some of his stuff was very good but Norwich were on top for long periods in the end. For the goal Diouf lost Tettey and it was good header. Brady did well against Shaqiri, but he's not a left back. He did alright for his first Premier League game away from home. Norwich are the same as last time they were in the league. They missed too many chances. Butland made some good saves but sometimes it is bad finishing and you have got to score. The manager will be thinking that in the three games they should have scored two or three. They could rue those dropped points at the end of the season.

Sunderland celebrates scoring his team's goal against Swansea with Lee Cattermole Sunderland picked up their first point of the Premier League season with a hard-fought 1-1 draw at home to Swansea. Garry Monk's side were the more dominant throughout the match and created the better chances, but Jermain Defoe's goal after an hour cancelled out Bafetimbi Gomis' first-half strike. Sunderland fans demanded a reaction from their players after two desperate performances had seen them ship seven goals in their opening two games and they certainly got that at the Stadium of Light. Jack Rodwell and Lee Cattermole led the charge in midfield, pressing Swansea high up the pitch and showing the kind of hunger the supporters had been looking for. Bafetimbi Gomis fires Swansea into a 1-0 lead The return of John O'Shea, who started his first match of the new campaign, also seemed to steady the ship as the Black Cats looked more compact and solid all over the pitch. Despite that, it was Swansea who had the better chances in the first half as Sunderland failed to carve out any clear-cut opportunities. Jermain Defoe grabbed an equalising goal to earn Sunderland their first point of the season the 1-1 draw with Swansea. Jermain Defoe grabbed an equalising goal to earn Sunderland their first point of the season the 1-1 draw with Swansea. Andre Ayew has enjoyed a fine start to his Premier League career, with two goals in two games coming into this match, and he had the first chance, firing wide after 13 minutes. Bafetimbi Gomis his goal for Swansea City against Sunderland Sunderland's Jeremain Lens was then booked after committing a couple of fouls, while Cattermole soon followed him into the book after clattering into Ayew from behind. On the half-hour mark Kyle Naughton's knock down set up Gomis, but the striker's effort was saved easily by Costel Pantilimon. Dick Advocaat manager of Sunderland reacts during the game against Swansea City A couple of minutes later Sunderland had a half chance as Yann M'Vila's free-kick into the box was headed into the path of Danny Graham who tried a spectacular overhead, kick but it deflected off of Jack Cork and fell nicely for Fabianski. Graham was then in action at the other end as he was on hand to block Gylfi Sigurdsson's goal-bound effort. Sunderland boss Dick Advocaat said his players showed a lot of character in their 1-1 draw with Swansea. Sunderland boss Dick Advocaat said his players showed a lot of character in their 1-1 draw with Swansea. Despite a much improved first-half full of endeavour, Sunderland went into the break 1-0 down. Ayew did brilliantly to release Naughton, whose through ball found Gomis down the right-hand side of the penalty box, and the striker fired his effort across Sebastian Coates and Pantilimon into the far corner. Montero started the second half with real intent; drawing the foul from Coates just on the edge of the box but from the resulting free-kick Jonjo Shelvey could only fire straight at Pantilimon. Jermain Defoe shoots low past Lukasz Fabianski to make it 1-1 Swansea went close shortly afterwards when Sunderland fell asleep at a quick corner and Shelvey's cross was met by the unmarked Ayew but his header came back off the post. Pantilimon was then on hand to deny Montero whose low effort was at an awkward height for the big goalkeeper. Ayew had another golden opportunity as he got on the end of Shelvey's cross but the forward could not connect with his header properly from eight yards. Swansea were made to pay for that a moment later as Lens picked out Defoe with a delightful slide-rule pass and the former Tottenham striker fired the ball brilliantly into the bottom corner to level the match. Andre Ayew of Swansea City and Patrick van Aanholt of Sunderland compete for the ball The home side had appeals for a penalty waved away a couple of minutes later as Rodwell's effort from distance appeared to strike the hand of Ashley Williams in the Swansea box. Swansea boss Garry Monk felt his side had chances to kill the game off in their 1-1 draw away to Sunderland. Swansea boss Garry Monk felt his side had chances to kill the game off in their 1-1 draw away to Sunderland. Pantilimon was then called into action again to deny first Shelvey and then Sigurdsson, whose low effort looked to be creeping in the bottom corner before the former Manchester City 'keeper got a hand to it to turn it round the post. The Sunderland goalkeeper then kept his side level after 73 minutes when he somehow got a hand to Gomis' point-blank header when it looked as though the Swansea striker had his second of the match. Sunderland pressed forward in the final stages as they looked for a winner but wasted two good chances from free-kicks, both of which were around 20 yards out, as Lens hit the wall before Sebastian Larsson, who had come on as a substitute in time added on specifically for the set piece, suffered a similar result with his effort. Phil Thompson praised Sunderland’s commitment against Swansea as they drew a game he thought they should have lost. Phil Thompson praised Sunderland’s commitment against Swansea as they drew a game he thought they should have lost. Soccer Saturday verdict - Phil Thompson Swansea probably deserved it. Pantilimon made two saves, one of them a wonder save off Gomis when he clawed it out with his left hand. I think Swansea read everything that had been said about Sunderland. They came knowing what a good side they were and I think they have been a little complacent but they grew into it. They lost the goal when they were on top and Pantilimon has made a few saves, they created better chances. The crowd were loving the effort and commitment from this Sunderland side. I think Jermain Defoe should play down the middle because this boy knows how to play the position. You get those balls and he starts his movement from left to right and it's just what he wants.

hat-trick as Bournemouth earned their first Premier League points in a thrilling 4-3 win against West Ham at Upton Park. The striker scored twice to put his side 2-0 ahead at half-time and netted Bournemouth's fourth from the spot after Carl Jenkinson was sent off. West Ham had battled back to 2-2 through a Mark Noble penalty and a Cheikhou Kouyate goal, but Mark Pugh restored Bournemouth's lead in the 66th minute. Then came the late drama as Jenkinson saw red for a foul on Max Gradel with Wilson stroking home the penalty, before Modibo Maiga struck eight minutes from time to ensure a nervy finish. For the neutrals watching, this pulsating game had everything - goals, a sending off, two penalties and end-to-end action, but for the two managers - Slaven Bilic and Eddie Howe - it must have been a horrible watch. Both teams defended generously with the Hammers leading the way from kick-off. Aaron Cresswell lost possession out wide, giving Simon Francis the chance to pick out Wilson in the box. Wilson fires home his second goal The right-back's cross was met with a fierce side-foot finish from the Bournemouth striker leaving goalkeeper Darren Randolph no chance on his West Ham debut. Cresswell was at fault again for the second goal. The left-back played a careless back pass into the path of Wilson who ruthlessly fired past Randolph. Dismayed by his team's shocking defensive display, Bilic hauled Angelo Ogbonna off after 34 minutes and sent on James Tomkins to sure up the soft centre in the home defence. The Croatian made another switch at the interval bringing Matt Jarvis on for Kevin Nolan and it appeared to have the desired effect as the home side found themselves level eight minutes into the second half. Slaven Bilic instructs his players The comeback started with a clumsy challenge from Josh King on Noble that gifted West Ham a penalty a minute after the restart. The midfielder dusted himself off to stroke the spot kick past Artur Boruc. Sloppy defending cost Bournemouth again when they switched off at a throw-in, allowing Diafra Sakho time to turn and shoot in the box. Boruc did well to get down low to his right and beat it out, but there was nothing he could do about the rebound as Kouyate smashed the ball into the roof of the net. Mark Noble gave credit to Bournemouth who game out on top in a seven-goal thriller at the Boleyn Ground Mark Noble gave credit to Bournemouth who game out on top in a seven-goal thriller at the Boleyn Ground With the crowd behind them West Ham pushed for a third, but back came Bournemouth. Gradel shrugged off Winston Reid before finding an unmarked Pugh inside the box. The midfielder kept his cool to sidestep a lunging Jenkinson and steer the Cherries back in front. Things went from bad to worse for Jenkinson when he was sent off for pulling Gradel down in the box. From the resulting penalty Wilson completed his treble and put Bournemouth 4-2 ahead. The scoring wasn't over as the Bournemouth defence opened their gates and waved Maiga through to score past Boruc. The Hammers frantically chased an equaliser, but the Cherries' rear guard stood firm to claim the points and consign West Ham to their second home defeat on the bounce. Charlie Nicholas was full of praise for Bournemouth following their first win in the Premier League Charlie Nicholas was full of praise for Bournemouth following their first win in the Premier League Soccer Saturday verdict - Charlie Nicholas Bournemouth proved to me and themselves that there is more to footballing philosophy and I hope that the majority of people that have seen this will be more inclined to focus on how attacking Bournemouth were, rather than criticise West Ham who were awful defensively. We can pull plenty of holes in West Ham but it is impressive to go away from home and score four goals in the Premier League. They pushed Gradel up the left side and King was closer to Wilson and they got the full-backs quite high up the pitch. Wilson had pace and movement and the service supplied by Surman in midfield was wonderful. I don't know what these West Ham fans expect. Bilic couldn't do a thing about this. It's dreadful defending, their passing was abysmal and it was awful. Yes, you'll hear frustration but if you boo them, they will shrink and don't want the ball.

Christian Benteke scored his first goal for Liverpool on his home debut as Bournemouth were beaten 1-0 in controversial circumstances on Monday night.

Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers was pleased with his side's performance in their win over Bournemouth Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers was pleased with his side's performance in their win over Bournemouth Reds captain Jordan Henderson whipped the ball in from the left and Coutinho, who was coming back from an offside position, made a motion towards it, which, under the new rules for this season, meant he was affecting play.

Giroud (grounded, right) hooks Arsenal in front at Crystal Palace Arsenal got off the mark for the season as Damien Delaney's second-half own goal gave them a 2-1 win at Crystal Palace. The Irishman shinned an Alexis Sanchez header into his own net (55) after Olivier Giroud (16) and Joel Ward (28) had exchanged excellent first-half goals, ensuring an immediate Arsenal response to their opening-day shocker against West Ham. Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud says he is happy his side bounced back after last week's defeat to West Ham by beating Crystal Palace 2-1 Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud says he is happy his side bounced back after last week's defeat to West Ham by beating Crystal Palace 2-1 Palace are entitled to think it might have been different but for Lee Mason's lenient treatment of Francis Coquelin's persistent misdemeanours, but there was enough early swagger and defensive character about the visitors to encourage belief last week's performance was a false start and no more. And Arsene Wenger will have noted that the improvement was in no small part down to his decision to restore Santi Cazorla to the central role in which he excelled in the second half of last season. Palace manager Alan Pardew believed Arsenal's sharpness and counter attacking was the difference between the two sides Palace manager Alan Pardew believed Arsenal's sharpness and counter attacking was the difference between the two sides The Spaniard's place on the left was taken by Sanchez, whose extended spell on the sidelines lasted all of 67 minutes last week before the SOS went out and who was deemed fit to start at Selhurst Park. The Chilean was his usual one-man wrecking ball, but there was a rustiness about his touch early on as he took an age over a one-on-one chance and allowed Palace's defensive cover to get back and block. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger says his side's 2-1 victory at Crystal Palace was 'significant' Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger says his side's 2-1 victory at Crystal Palace was 'significant' Arsenal's sense of purpose was clear and they were rewarded when Giroud, who spoke confidently in the week about his ability to lead the line, made good on his words with a lovely hooked volley from Mesut Ozil's drilled centre. The goal, and a subsequent Sanchez chance which Alex McCarthy saved one-handed, came about from Palace's sloppiness in possession, and Ward was the chief culprit. The Super Sunday panel discuss whether Arsenal's Francis Coquelin should have been sent off for a second bookable offence The Super Sunday panel discuss whether Arsenal's Francis Coquelin should have been sent off for a second bookable offence But the full-back atoned with the kind of equaliser that belied his previous tally of a single Palace goal, fizzing a 20-yard shot past Petr Cech from James McArthur's lay-off. Palace were emboldened and enjoyed their best spell either side of half-time: Coquelin went in the book for bringing an unceremonious end to a Yannick Bolasie burst, and Alan Pardew plainly felt the Frenchman was skating on thin ice when Wilfried Zaha found himself on the wrong end of a buffeting just before the break. Joel Ward of Crystal Palace celebrates his equaliser Coquelin survived, at least until he was hooked for the good of himself and the team following another thud through the back of McArthur, and by the time he was replaced Arsenal were back in front. Connor Wickham had missed the chance to mark his home debut with a goal, prodding against the post, and Palace paid for it when Sanchez met a stood-up Hector Bellerin cross with a firm header that Delaney could not keep out. Alexis Sanchez of Arsenal celebrates the own goal scored by Damien Delaney of Crystal Palace The home side tested Arsenal's mettle with countless crosses, but a fourth goal was always likelier at the Palace end as Aaron Ramsey, the outstanding Cazorla and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain all missed chances to settle the argument.

Manchester City against Chelsea, with analysis from the Super Sunday panel including Thierry Henry ​Manchester City earned first blood in the title race after beating Chelsea 3-0 in a heavyweight Super Sunday clash. With just two games on the board, City are already five points clear of the current champions. Vincent Kompany believes his side are sending the right signals to the rest of the Premier League Vincent Kompany believes his side are sending the right signals to the rest of the Premier League Sergio Aguero opened the scoring on 31 minutes - finally converting one of five presentable chances in a one-sided opening to the match. John Terry was substituted at half-time by Jose Mourinho in attempt to tighten things up but City kept the pressure on and Vincent Kompany doubled the lead on 79 minutes. Aguero scores City's opening goal Fernandinho, who could have been sent off for an elbow on Diego Costa in the first half, struck a late third. City started fast at the Etihad Stadium and could have been ahead within 30 seconds but stand-in Chelsea goalkeeper Asmir Begovic, who replaced the suspended Thibaut Courtois, denied the striker from close range. Manchester City's Vincent Kompany celebrates The battle between the striker and the ‘keeper continued with Begovic denying Aguero three more times in the opening 30 minutes, the pick of which was a one-handed save from a fierce drive from City’s top goalscorer from last season. Chelsea were being outplayed in every department and City finally got their noses in front just after the half-hour mark. Manuel Pellegrini believes Manchester City 'always dominate Chelsea' when the two sides clash under his stewardship Manuel Pellegrini believes Manchester City 'always dominate Chelsea' when the two sides clash under his stewardship Aguero and Yaya Toure linked up to bamboozle a flat-footed John Terry and Gary Cahill on the edge of the area before the striker steadied himself to skilfully roll the ball into the corner of the net. Chelsea’s service towards Eden Hazard and Diego Costa was non-existent in the first half and the striker cut a frustrated figure. His mood was angered further on 42 minutes when he was cracked in the head by a Fernandinho elbow that drew blood on Costa’s brow and just a yellow card from referee Martin Atkinson. Manchester City's Fernandinho scores City's third Terry was the fall guy for Chelsea’s dismal opening 45 minutes, being replaced by Kurt Zouma at the break - the first time Mourinho has substituted Terry in the Premier League. The visitors did improve after the break with Hazard seeing more of the ball and City being forced deeper into their own half. However, when Chelsea’s chance came on 70 minutes, they didn’t take it. Manchester City's Sergio Aguero celebrates scoring Hazard was found inside the box by Costa and although he beat Kompany with a clever shimmy, his shot from 12 yards was too close to Joe Hart, who pushed the ball to safety. Kompany showed Hazard how it should be done with 11 minutes remaining. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has defended his decision to substitute captain John Terry at half-time Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has defended his decision to substitute captain John Terry at half-time He showed a greater desire than Branislav Ivanovic to meet a David Silva corner at the near post and flicked a well-judged header into the far corner.

Manchester City's Sergio Aguero celebrates Ivanovic's sloppy clearance was seized upon by the rampaging City attack and the ball was worked to the midfielder, who spanked a first-time effort into the far corner. Costa hit the post for Chelsea in stoppage time but this was to be City’s day. The champions have work to do.

Lukaku, who hit 10 goals in the Premier League last season, scored halfway through the first half with a superb header from six yards, before finishing a sweeping move with Barkley on the stroke of half time for 2-0. Barkley’s fine finish rounded off the win with six minutes remaining, giving Everton their first three points at St Mary’s since 2002, and leaving Ronald Koeman's Southampton without a victory so far this season. Lukaku headed past Maarten Stekelenburg to open the scoring Everton fans made their feelings known to owner Bill Kenwright before the match after a banner was seen flying over St Mary’s reading: “Kenwright and Co, time to go”, but the occasion belonged to the Toffees. Saints striker Graziano Pelle went close with a header six yards out from Dusan Tadic’s cross, before Saido Mane forced a fine save out of Tim Howard from a tight angle on the left. But just 43 seconds passed from the Everton goalkeepers’ stop to the visitors taking the lead in the 22nd minute, Lukaku heading home from Arouna Kone’s pin-point right-wing cross following a speedy break. Everton fans flew a plane with a banner calling for chairman Bill Kenwright to leave Barkley spurned a fine opportunity to double Everton’s lead, hitting the ball straight at Maarten Stekelenburg after being found in acres of space central to goal, before Tom Cleverley fluffed the rebound wide. But Barkley had a big hand to play in Everton’s second, collecting Lukaku’s pass on the halfway line and slipping it back to the Belgian 16 yards out, Lukaku duly applying the finish low into the bottom left corner. Southampton came out fighting in the second half, but Pelle missed two decent opportunities to halve the deficit. First, his fierce first-time volley fell straight into the hands of Howard, before he miscued a free header from a corner with 20 minutes remaining. Ross Barkley rounded off the win with a fine finish in the 84th minute But Everton rounded off a fine counter-attacking performance late on, Barkley collecting a Seamus Coleman pass on the edge of the area and curling past Stekelenburg into the far right corner for a much-needed kick-start to the season.

for Sunderland ​Sunderland's miserable start to the Premier League season continued as Norwich won 3-1 at a mutinous Stadium of Light to record their first points of the campaign. Beaten inside half an hour at Leicester last week, it took only slightly longer for Sunderland to find themselves 2-0 down at home as goals from Russell Martin (26) and Steven Whittaker (37) effectively ended the contest before half-time. Nathan Redmond's third just before the hour mark did nothing for the mood of the home supporters, many of whom could be seen streaming out with more than a third of the game still to play. Those that stayed witnessed a first Sunderland goal for Duncan Watmore in the final minutes, but it was never a threat to a result that had some fans serenading the club's owner with cries of 'are you watching, Ellis Short?' Dick Advocaat made no secret of his unease at the manner of the Leicester defeat, and there was little here to suggest he faces anything less than a fraught finale to a career he chose to prolong for one last season. Yann M'Vila - Sunderland's 1000th debutant - avoided the kind of indiscretion that saw him sent off for the club's U21s last week, but a bit of aggression would scarcely have gone amiss in a bypassed home midfield whose carelessness often encouraged City's attacks. It was Lee Cattermole's profligacy in possession that started the chain of events leading to the opening goal, Cameron Jerome picking his pocket and starting a move that ended with Costel Pantilimon tipping Jonny Howson's shot round the post. If that was a wake-up call Sunderland slept right through it: Norwich's quickly-taken corner caught them cold, Robbie Brady's shot rebounding off Pantilimon and in off Martin, who had the decency to look slightly sheepish in celebration. Norwich had enjoyed marginally the better of a chanceless skirmish to that moment, but the goal energised them to such a degree it was no surprise when they added another 11 minutes later. Whittaker started and finished it, sliding a pass in to the feet of Wes Hoolahan on the edge of the box, and firing the Irishman's tidy return clean and true across Pantilimon. Sunderland briefly hinted at a spirited response either side of the break, Steven Fletcher and Younes Kaboul missing presentable headed chances, but the game was up when Hoolahan's second subtle flick of the day allowed Redmond to slide a finish inside the near post (57). More might have followed, Jerome shanking one opportunity past the far post, and the sole cause for Sunderland cheer was a vigorous cameo from young striker Watmore, who justified a rousing ovation with a volleyed consolation late on. Soccer Saturday verdict - Paul Merson It’s the exact same situation as last season when they got beat at home by Villa. They just leave two at the back, they need to go from a base. They’re all over the place. I’ve been in team where you’re getting well beat at home when the crowd are on your back and it isn’t nice. You’ve got to show a bit about you and today if any of those players said \"could I go off?\" they would’ve all gone off. They don’t look like they’re running around for the manager like they were last year, that’s my opinion.

Swansea took full advantage of Daryl Janmaat’s needless sending-off to beat Newcastle United 2-0 at the Liberty Stadium. Newcastle were already facing a tricky afternoon after Bafétimbi Gomis had given the hosts an eighth-minute lead but life was made harder when Janmaat was dismissed just before the break for two bookings for fouls on Jefferson Montero. Andre Ayew notched his second goal in his second game for Swansea to wrap up the points on 52 minutes in a game which also saw Garry Monk's men twice hit the woodwork. Both sides came into the contest fresh from positive performances in respective 2-2 draws on the opening weekend but it was Swansea, rather than the Newcastle, that kept up that momentum in the early stages. Andre Ayew of Swansea City celebrates Jonjo Shelvey was at the heart of most good early work by the hosts and it was his vision in midfield that provided the opening goal. On eight minutes the former Liverpool man split the two Newcastle centre-backs with a wonderful pass that sent Gomis through on goal and after rounding Tim Krul with ease, the striker tapped the ball into the empty net. Newcastle had an obvious plan to get tight to the lively Montero in the early stages but Jaanmat took that a little too far by crunching into him from behind on 17 minutes deep inside the Swansea half. It was a needless foul and booking that would cost the visitors dear later in the half. Although they didn’t create any meaningful chances, Newcastle, through Moussa Sissoko, were slowly starting to pen the hosts in and Gabriel Obertan tested Lucas Fabianski with a low shot that required a good save down to his right. Daryl Janmaat of Newcastle United walks off the pitch after receiving a red card against Swansea With half-time approaching they were well in the game but their task of staging a comeback was made much more difficult on 40 minutes when Jaanmat picked up his second yellow card. Montero had already drew another foul from the Toon full-back to put him on a tightrope before the Dutch defender pulled Montero back as he drove forward to leave the referee little choice but to brandish a second yellow. The dismissal gave Montero more space to work and he smacked the post just before half-time with a fierce 20-yard drive. Steven Taylor replaced Sissoko at the break as Steve McClaren tried to nullify the space that Montero was exploiting but his plan failed. Bafetimbi Gomis celebrates after scoring against Newcastle The winger danced his way down the left-flank on 52 minutes and delivered a pin-point cross for Ayew to powerfully head home and seal the points. That goal killed the game as a contest and Gylfi Sigurdsson came very close to adding a third on 59 minutes but his 25-yard drive cannoned back off the crossbar. Soccer Saturday verdict - Matt Le Tissier It is never easy when you go down to the ten men. Especially the forwards when you know you’re going to get very little service from there on in. [Cisse] was not really in the game at all before Newcastle went down to 10 men but it was just poor all round. We didn’t see much of Wijnaldum today, but not too many Newcastle players will have come out of that with too much credit. Newcastle have got some good players in the side and I’m sure when Steve McClaren gets it to click it will be a lot better.

First-half strikes from Eric Dier and Nacer Chadli appeared to have earned the hosts all three points but Marko Arnautovic’s 78th-minute penalty, followed by Mame Biram Diouf's header five minutes later, rounded off a dramatic turnaround for the Potters after Spurs had lost Harry Kane to injury. Spurs, who looked intent at bouncing back from last week’s defeat at Manchester United, started the game the brighter of the two sides. Mark Hughes was delighted with Stoke City's second-half performance after coming back from two goals down to Tottenham Mark Hughes was delighted with Stoke City's second-half performance after coming back from two goals down to Tottenham Only Stoke ‘keeper Jack Butland prevented them from opening the scoring inside the opening ten minutes, twice denying the influential Christian Eriksen low to his left and then palming the midfielder's free-kick away from goal. At the other end, Hugo Lloris almost handed the visitors the opening goal as Diouf failed to capitalise on his casual clearance, and Ryan Mason raced back to block Marco van Ginkel’s effort. But Spurs were soon rewarded for their bright start when Dier rose highest at the near-post to head home Eriksen’s corner on 19 minutes. Stoke, who also kicked off their campaign with a 1-0 defeat, at home to Liverpool, looked disjointed and rarely threatened the hosts.

Kane played a delightful lofted ball over the Stoke defence for Mason, who was denied by Butland. But the Potters were made to pay for Diouf’s miss moments earlier as Spurs doubled their lead. Ben Davies raced to the byline in first-half stoppage time and pitched a ball to far post where Chadli sent a volley into the far corner, courtesy of a deflection off Erik Pieters. Butland’s point-blank save to deny Kane early in the second half gave Stoke the platform to haul themselves back into contention. Eric Dier was disappointed not to take all three points for Tottenham as Stoke fought back for a draw Eric Dier was disappointed not to take all three points for Tottenham as Stoke fought back for a draw Mark Hughes used his substitutes to great effect after the interval, with the inclusion of Stephen Ireland and debutant Joselu, coupled with Kane leaving the field with a suspected calf injury, turning the game in favour of the visitors. Joselu's smart turn in the area saw him hurled to the ground by Spurs centre-back Toby Alderweireld on his home debut, handing Stoke a route back into the game as Arnautovic rifled home from 12 yards.

Soccer Saturday verdict - Phil Thompson Phil Thompson felt that Tottenham took their foot of the gas and let Stoke in for the draw. Phil Thompson felt that Tottenham took their foot of the gas and let Stoke in for the draw. At 2-0, you're probably thinking 'well, we're cruising here' - but the Premier League is not like that. You take your foot off the gas and it happens. But Spurs do need help up front, the nearest they had on the bench was Dele Alli as being anywhere near someone who might get a goal. Chadli went up front and Lamela came on, but the impetus had been lost and Stoke were getting stronger. This was a Spurs side that should have been cruising. They should have had this well buried. They had that change with Harry Kane and perhaps they lost a little bit of confidence.

Quique Sanchez Flores’ team created numerous chances against Tony Pulis’ men, particularly in the first half of an entertaining game. But Troy Deeney and Odion Ighalo were both among the culprits as they wasted those opportunities and had to settle for a point instead. The hosts – who last hosted a top-flight fixture against Newcastle in May 2007 – were looking to build on their spirited 2-2 draw at Everton last week. They began brightly and overran their opponents in the opening 20 minutes but Boaz Myhill held Ighalo’s 25-yard drive and wasn’t really tested otherwise. Deeney put one header wide, had another blocked and looked on as Jose Jurado’s attempt at a scissor kick on the turn went wrong and spun well over the crossbar. Watford boss Quique Sanchez Flores said he was proud of his players performance in their 0-0 draw with West Brom. Watford boss Quique Sanchez Flores said he was proud of his players performance in their 0-0 draw with West Brom. West Brom were hemmed in and the pressure continued as Myhill and Gareth McAuley had to combine to deny Ighalo on the volley and Allan Nyom shot straight at the keeper. Jurado then curled a terrific free kick inches wide from 25 yards and Ighalo spurned his best opening as he shot just too high on the brink of half-time. Pulis will have wanted a better performance after the restart but it took time for him to get it as Watford kept pouring upfield. Jurado wasted a good chance after great footwork, Deeney had a downward header scrambled away and Ighalo was charged down as he took aim from outside the area. Odion Ighalo keeps the ball away from Jonas Olsson The visitors didn’t do much coming forward themselves and on one of the rare occasions they did get into the home half, Saido Berahino dived in the box trying, and failing, to win a penalty. Pulis needed to find a way to lift his team and his introduction of record signing Salomon Rondon did that to an extent. The forward had a chance within a minute of his introduction but put it over the bar and while he failed to test Huerelho Gomes, his arrival did coincide with overdue improvement from the visitors. West Brom boss Tony Pulis said he plans on doing some more business in the transfer market before the window shuts West Brom boss Tony Pulis said he plans on doing some more business in the transfer market before the window shuts Berahino had their best opening 10 minutes from the end as he put a header wide from three yards out at the back post and he’ll wonder how he missed. Watford ran out of ideas in the closing stages and it was the Hawthorns team who could have snatched all three points as Chris Brunt bent a free kick a yard too high from 25 yards out. Instead, they had to settle for a draw as they got off the mark after Monday’s 3-0 loss to Manchester City. Watford will feel they should have come out on top and they should have but it was an encouraging performance from them which they will believe they can build on. Soccer Saturday verdict - Charlie Nicholas Watford controlled most of the game. There were slight periods when West Brom had a little bit more about them when they went forward, predominantly it was all Watford. Jurado is the one that stood out for me today. The strikers work hard but he’s got a little bit of craft in the wider left position, likes to come in on his right – his stronger side. The best chance of the match fell to Berahino, an absolute sitter from three yards out. West Brom were poor going forward. Rickie Lambert never got a kick but it wasn’t his fault. Rondon came on, got one little attempt so it was about Tony Pulis getting something from the game so job done in that way.

Shinji Okazaki opened the scoring for the Foxes midway through the first-half before Riyad Mahrez doubled their advantage with a superbly-taken strike. Dimitri Payet reduced the Hammers' arrears just after the interval, but was unable to spark a comeback as the visitors hung on for their first victory at Upton Park in 15 years. The hosts were reduced to 10 men in stoppage time, with referee Anthony Taylor brandishing a red card to goalkeeper Adrian for a high challenge on Jamie Vardy. Riyad Mahrez scored what turned out to be the decisive goal in Leicester's 2-1 win away to West Ham Riyad Mahrez scored what turned out to be the decisive goal in Leicester's 2-1 win away to West Ham Leicester, victorious on the opening day against Sunderland, move above Manchester United and to the top of the early Premier League table on goal difference. West Ham were quickest to settle and were unlucky not to go in front inside the opening three minutes. A superb delivery from the left from summer signing Payet caused confusion in the Leicester defence, with Foxes captain Wes Morgan fortunate to see his inadvertent header cannon back off the crossbar and away to safety. Riyad Mahrez celebrates scoring Leicester's second goal at Upton Park West Ham, fresh from their opening-day win at Arsenal, continued to look the most threatening of the sides, with Carl Jenkinson and Diafra Sakho both firing over as they went in search of the opening goal. But against the run of play, it was the visitors who took the lead in the 27th minute. A great pass from the left from Vardy enabled Okazaki to breach the Hammers' backline and, after his initial shot was saved by Adrian, he made no mistake heading home the rebound. West Ham boss Slaven Bilic was disappointed with his side's 2-1 defeat to Leicester but accepts this can happen in the Premier League West Ham boss Slaven Bilic was disappointed with his side's 2-1 defeat to Leicester but accepts this can happen in the Premier League Claudio Ranieri's side, quiet until then, grew in confidence and were soon two goals to the good thanks to excellent work from goalscorer Okazaki and Marc Albrighton. The Japan striker, a summer signing from German club Mainz, held off the challenge of Winston Reid before feeding the ball to Albrighton. The winger's inch-perfect delivery was met by the incoming Mahrez and the Algeria international swept his effort past Adrian into the top corner of the net. West Ham failed to get a single shot on target during the opening 45 minutes, but will consider themselves unlucky not to have received a penalty after Kasper Schmeichel hauled down Sakho in first-half stoppage time. Dimitri Payet gave West Ham hope of an unlikely comeback Slaven Bilic attempted to inject more purpose into his West Ham side at half-time and replaced 16-year-old Reece Oxford, a week after his sensational performance at the Emirates Stadium, with debutant Pedro Obiang. It had the desired effect as Payet, West Ham's most impressive performer, dragged one goal back 10 minutes into the second half. After seeing his initial shot blocked, the France midfielder curled his second effort into the top corner of the net to give his side hope of a comeback. West Ham continued to press forward in the hope of an equaliser, with their best chance falling to Sakho, but Schmeichel was equal to his close-range effort. In his desperation to avoid defeat, Bilic sent forward Adrian for a corner in stoppage time. However, in his attempts to keep the ball in the penalty area, the Hammers goalkeeper caught Vardy with a high boot and was given his marching orders.

Louis van Gaal’s surprise inclusion of Adnan Januzaj, who made his first start since February, was vindicated on 29 minutes when the young Belgian opened the scoring with a deflected low finish. Villa had stood toe-to-toe with United in an uneventful opening half hour at Villa Park as both sides struggled to retain possession or mount a sustained assault on the opposing team’s goal.

Villa entered the first top-flight game held on a Friday night since 2004, unchanged following their opening day victory at newly-promoted Bournemouth while Januzaj’s inclusion saw Ashley Young start the game on the bench against his former club. United had the first opening on 16 minutes when Morgan Schneiderlin ghosted into the back post to connect with Memphis Depay’s centre, but he could not steer his effort on target. Brad Guzan crashed into Memphis to stop him from latching onto Juan Mata’s through ball on 20 minutes, as United began to take hold of the game. And the Reds were soon in front as Januzaj collected the influential Mata’s incisive pass, cut inside Richards' sliding tackle before sending a low drive in off the post, via a deflection off Villa defender Ciaran Clark.

The hosts then mounted a sustained push to get back into the game, with Gabriel Agbonlahor testing Romero with a header. Bastian Schweinsteiger and Ander Herrera were then brought on, swinging the game back in favour of the visitors despite Gestede entering the fray. United had lost their first-half fluency, although hardly looked in danger of losing their lead. And they had the chance to wrap up the game on 73 minutes when Mata produced yet another defence-splitting pass to put Memphis through on goal, but the Dutchman’s curling effort went agonisingly wide of Guzan’s goal.

Expensive new signing Raheem Sterling was fairly quiet on his Premier League debut for City and Sergio Aguero started on the bench, but it hardly mattered as Yaya Toure bagged a first-half brace before Vincent Kompany headed home a third after the break. However, the star of the show was City stalwart David Silva, who was a constant danger to the home defence as he showed off his delightful passing repertoire and wonderful close control. West Brom worked hard but struggled for possession and chances in the game was well beyond them, although they will not have to face such accomplished opponents every week. West Brom boss Tony Pulis admitted the defeat to Manchester City was down to the way he set up his side. West Brom boss Tony Pulis admitted the defeat to Manchester City was down to the way he set up his side. Visitors City enjoyed the bulk of the possession in the early stages and grabbed the lead in the ninth minute in somewhat fortuitous fashion. Jesus Navas cut the ball back to Toure, who produced a weak shot which trickled past a wrong-footed Boaz Myhill via Silva and Craig Dawson; the ball eventually rolling into the net almost in slow motion as the Baggies keeper looked on in horror. Sterling then caused West Brom problems with a low cross from the left which pinballed around in the area before Chris Brunt blocked Wilfried Bony’s shot. Jamie Carragher analysed Yaya Toure's brilliant goal against West Brom and believes that if City can get the best out of their midfielder then they have se Jamie Carragher analysed Yaya Toure's brilliant goal against West Brom and believes that if City can get the best out of their midfielder then they have se And City then doubled their lead with a fantastic 24th minute goal from Toure, who exchanged passes with Bony and this time found the roof of the net with a beautifully-struck shot from the edge of the box. The visitors continued to press forward and Bony had an effort deflect just wide of the post before Sterling wasted a great chance to grab a debut goal, not getting enough power behind his shot after being put through on goal, although Myhill did well to stick out a hand and make the save. Earlier in the day, West Brom made forward Salomon Rondon their new record signing and he watched on from the stands as Rickie Lambert and Saido Berahino struggled to make an impact in attack for the hosts. Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini heaped praise on David Silva - saying he's an enjoyable player to watch. Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini heaped praise on David Silva - saying he's an enjoyable player to watch. But Berahino was a touch unlucky just before the interval when his neat finish after latching onto a through ball was ruled out, replays suggesting it was very close but that he may have just strayed a fraction offside. Sterling was denied again by Myhill after the interval but West Brom then enjoyed a decent spell, Lambert putting a free-kick just over and Hart coming out to deny Berahino. But the wind was taken out of their sails just before the hour when Silva produced a wonderful piece of skill to win a left-wing corner which he floated to the near post, Kompany then using a combination of head and shoulder to send the ball looping over Myhill and into the far corner. With three points surely assured, City took their feet off the gas somewhat, despite the arrival of Aguero from the bench, and Sterling was taken off with 15 minutes remaining. But Manuel Pellegrini's man remained resolute at the back and Hart punched a couple of dangerous crosses clear before gratefully catching a header which James Morrison nodded straight at him. And the game then ended as it began, with City firmly in the ascendancy, and Myhill did well in the closing stages to keep out a low Aguero shot and an Aleksandar Kolarov free-kick.

Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger shakes hands with West Ham boss Slaven Bilic before kick-off The Croatian could hardly have wished for a better performance on the opening day after seeing his side knocked out of the Europa League in Romania on Thursday evening.

The Gunners laboured through the opening stages of the second half before Giroud fired into the side netting after being played down the left of the penalty area by Mesut Ozil. But it was West Ham who struck next after 57 minutes as Oxlade-Chamberlain failed to clear his lines properly and Zarate picked up the loose ball, turned and fired a shot into the bottom corner past a wrong-footed Cech. Aaron Ramsey turns and runs at the Hammers defence Wenger responded by bringing on Walcott and then Sanchez but the Gunners continued to struggle to create chances. Oxlade-Chamberlain smashed the ball into the side netting and Sanchez forced a save from Adrian in injury-time.

Papiss Demba Cisse scores the equaliser for Newcastle Wijnaldum almost got his debut off to a dream start after being picked out on the edge of the box by Moussa Sissoko, but the Dutch forward saw his goalbound effort well blocked by Steven Davis. Krul was forced into two smart stops as Southampton pressed, and on 24 minutes, they broke the deadlock with ease. Debutant Cedric Soares whipped a delightful ball in, but under little challenge from the Magpies backline, Pelle headed his third goal of the season past Krul, despite the Dutch ‘keeper’s best efforts.

However, the home team levelled on 42 minutes, after Massadio Haidara’s cross looped off Mane, deceived Maarten Stekelenburg, and Cisse was on hand to chest in almost on the goal line. After the interval, Maya Yoshida should have scored from close range with a header, which Krul somehow kept out with his trailing leg, and the Saints defender was immediately made to pay. Cisse celebrates his goal against Southampton On the counter, Gabriel Obertan raced clear before whipping a pinpoint cross right onto the head of the onrushing Wijnaldum who guided the ball expertly past a stranded Stekelenburg to put Newcastle ahead. The hosts looked good value for their lead, and were comfortable soaking up Saints possession, but eventually Newcastle were made to pay for standing off too much. Dusan Tadic was allowed far too much time to pick his cross, and the Serbian centred for substitute Long, who scored the game's third perfectly-placed header to bring the scores level again.

The match appeared to be drifting towards a goalless draw before Coutinho unleashed a dipping, curling effort from 25 yards out to hand the visitors an unlikely three points. And the win for Liverpool will have eased the pressure on Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers after the Reds lost 6-1 at Stoke on the final day of last season. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers was happy with both the performance of his players and the result against Stoke Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers was happy with both the performance of his players and the result against Stoke The visitors began the game with five players who had featured in that drubbing back in May, while Rodgers also handed debuts to the likes of Christian Benteke, Nathaniel Clyne, Joe Gomez and James Milner. Stoke boss Mark Hughes, on the other hand, gave first starts to former Barcelona attacker Ibrahim Afellay and defender Glen Johnson, against his old team, although Bojan Krkic was not fit enough to feature as he continues his recovery from a serious knee injury. Watch Philippe Coutinho's superb late winner. Watch Philippe Coutinho's superb late winner. However, in stark contrast to last season’s goal fest at the Britannia, the opening period was stale and lacklustre as both teams made a cagey start to the contest, although Stoke will still have been disappointed not to have gone in ahead at the break. The Potters' first good opening came after just eight minutes when the ball broke kindly to former Liverpool midfielder Charlie Adam, however, the Scot scuffed his shot when really he should have at least hit the target. Stoke City manager Mark Hughes (left) and Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers watch the action from the sidelines And 10 minutes before half-time Stoke – in front of the watching Xherdan Shaqiri in the Britannia stands – had an even better chance to break the deadlock through right-back Johnson on his first start for his new team. The lively Jonathan Walters fed Marco Van Ginkel down Stoke's right flank and after the Dutchman’s deflected cut-back had been cleared off the line by Martin Skrtel, the ball was fed back to Johnson, only for the former Liverpool full-back to blaze over from six yards out. That glaring miss – Johnson’s last goal for the Reds actually came against Stoke at Anfield back in December – meant the two teams went in all square at the break, unlike in their last meeting when Stoke were 5-0 ahead at the interval. Goalkeeper Jack Butland and Geoff Cameron foil new Reds striker Christian Benteke The visitors knew they had to improve in the second period after not having a shot on goal in the opening 45 minutes, despite some nice touches from their £32.5m signing Benteke, and they did. However, Rodgers’ side were still grateful to goalkeeper Simon Mignolet for keeping the scores level after the Belgium international produced a fine reflex save to keep out Mame Biram Diouf’s close-range effort after 64 minutes. Thereafter, Liverpool appeared to grow in confidence, with the Reds finally having an effort on target through centre-back Dejan Lovren midway through the second half, before Coutinho gave notice of his intent by going on a mazy dribble through a posse of Stoke players, only for his goalbound effort to be blocked by the home defence. Stoke manager Mark Hughes believes his side didn't deserve to lose to Liverpool Stoke manager Mark Hughes believes his side didn't deserve to lose to Liverpool Both sides opted to make full use of their benches, with Rodgers handing new boy Roberto Firmino his Liverpool debut in place of the impressive Jordan Ibe for the final 12 minutes of the evenly-contested encounter. But it was Firmino’s compatriot who settled matters as, like he did on so many occasions, the little midfielder produced a moment of brilliance to light up the Britannia and break Stoke hearts. Picking up possession of the ball midway in Stoke’s half, Coutinho turned past Steve Sidwell before beating Stoke ‘keeper Jack Butland with a sensational long-range strike worthy of winning any game.

Louis van Gaal’s side needed a Kyle Walker own goal, however, midway through the first half to claim all three points in a game with few chances. And United were grateful to a late double save by new goalkeeper Sergio Romero for the win. Both teams started the match without their first-choice 'keepers, with United opting to hand Romero his debut, alongside fellow new signings Matteo Darmian, Memphis Depay and Morgan Schneiderlin. Meanwhile the visitors, who saw Toby Alderweireld make his bow, had Michel Vorm deputising for injured skipper Hugo Lloris. However, it was the Argentine who was the first to be called upon as Spurs, after a difficult opening five minutes, slowly began to settle into their afternoon’s work, and the visitors really should have opened the scoring after just five minutes. Louis van Gaal claims his side were lucky to take all three points against a good Tottenham side Louis van Gaal claims his side were lucky to take all three points against a good Tottenham side Striker Harry Kane was involved, with the England international chipping a glorious ball over United’s static defence for Christian Eriksen to run on to, only for the diminutive playmaker’s lob to just miss the target. Romero – who made a nervous start with a few wayward kicks – was then called upon to make a smart block at his near post to deny Walker, who had been slipped through on goal by Erkisen, while Moussa Dembele was then denied a clear run on goal by an errant assistant referee's flag. Tottenham's Kyle Walker (left) scores the decisive own goal Seconds later United were ahead, although Spurs coach Mauricio Pochettino will have been furious with the manner in which United broke the deadlock, coming as it did via a stray pass in midfield. United were quick to take advantage, however, with the ever-alert Juan Mata finding Depay, before the Dutchman picked out Ashley Young’s penetrating run down the right. The England winger’s cross found an unmarked Wayne Rooney waiting on the penalty spot and although the backtracking Walker got back in time to challenge United’s captain, the right back only succeeded in diverting the striker's goalbound shot into the back of the net past a helpless Vorm. Manchester United's Wayne Rooney (right) and Memphis Depay (middle) celebrate taking the lead That goal appeared to settle United’s – and the home crowd’s – nerves as Van Gaal’s side dominated the remainder of the first half as they looked for that killer second goal, although the closest they actually came to it was a scuffed Mata shot from the edge of the box that went just past Vorm’s far post. The second period was a cagey affair as both teams struggled with the oppressive heat, resulting in a raft of substitutions, including a first sighting at Old Trafford new United midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger. The experienced German’s introduction on the hour-mark, in place of the tiring Michael Carrick, appeared to calm United as the midfielder began to dictate the tempo of the game. Bastian Schweinsteiger replaced Michael Carrick to make his Premier League debut However, the hosts did not have their first shot on goal until the 65th minute when a flowing move down United’s right flank ended with the ball falling at the feet of Young at the back post, only for the winger’s low shot to be well saved at his near post by Vorm. Rooney then tried his best to kill the game off by attempting a spectacular overhead kick in front of the Stretford End, similar to his memorable effort against Manchester City five years ago. The chance came after an excellent driving run down the right by United’s impressive new right-back Darmian, but Rooney caught fresh air rather than the ball. Matteo Darmian (left) impressed on his Manchester United debut And those near misses left United open to the dangers of a Spurs smash and grab in the closing stages, something which very nearly happened late on, only for Romero to twice come to the home team’s rescue. Tottenham substitute Ryan Mason pumped a free kick deep into the box with just two minutes remaining, where a combination of man-of-the-match Chris Smalling and Kane both challenged for the ball, with Romero needing to be alert to keep the resulting ricochet out of his goal. Sergio Romero made an important save in the closing stages However, the threat was not over as the visitors kept the pressure on, before Eriksen tried his luck with a low shot from the edge of the box which Romero was alert enough to keep out at full stretch. A draw, though, would have been more than Spurs deserved for their afternoon’s work, while United made up for losing at home to Swansea on the opening day of last season with this narrow victory.

started their debut Premier League season with a 1-0 defeat at the Vitality Stadium. Having survived a flurry of Bournemouth chances in the final stages of the first half, the visitors, rejuvenated by the interval, broke the deadlock when substitute Gestede rose highest to connect with Ashley Westwood’s corner on 72 minutes. Playing in the top-flight for the first time in the club's 116-year history, Bournemouth's failure to turn their first half dominance into goals led to a painful lesson in the harsh realities of the Premier League, with Dan Gosling, Callum Wilson and Marc Pugh spurning great opportunities to break the deadlock. Villa debutant Rudy Gestede says he’s happy to have opened his Premier League account in Villa’s 1-0 win over Bournemouth Villa debutant Rudy Gestede says he’s happy to have opened his Premier League account in Villa’s 1-0 win over Bournemouth The introduction of new signing Max Gradel briefly reignited the Cherries late on, though, as they pushed for an equaliser, but Villa held on for a third consecutive opening day victory, and manager Tim Sherwood's first, in the Premier League. Several summer signings were on show, with Bournemouth's Joshua King, newly-appointed Villa captain Micah Richards, Jordan Amavi, Jordan Veretout, Idrissa Gueye and Jordan Ayew all making their debuts for their respective clubs. Gestede (centre) celebrates his goal with Gabby Agbonlahor Despite being the smallest ground in the Premier League, the Vitality was rocking ahead of Bournemouth’s first top-flight game in English football. And the atmosphere inspired Eddie Howe’s side to a bright first-half display, as last season’s Championship winners created had the better of the first-half chances against a team looking to recover from the loss of their star players from last season – Christian Benteke and Fabian Delph. Marc Pugh had the hosts' first sight of goal when he headed over before Gosling missed a gilt-edged chance to the scoring 10 minutes before the interval. Tim Sherwood praised new signing Rudy Gestede after opening his Villa account Tim Sherwood praised new signing Rudy Gestede after opening his Villa account After some confusion in the Villa area, Micah Richards failed to take the opportunity to clear his lines. The ball then dropped in front of Gosling who, leaning back, steered his effort a yard wide of the Villa goal from 12 yards. And soon the Cherries wasted another chance as Wilson raced clear of Ciaran Clark and shot straight at Villa goalkeeper Brad Guzan. Guzan was called into action on the stroke of half-time as again as Pugh’s volley was desperately parried away from goal by the Villa stopper. Cherries' Andrew Surman and Villa's Jordan Veretout compete for the ball But Sherwood's half-time team-talk had the desired effect as Villa produced a far more dynamic second half display. Gueye was close to scoring on his debut when he met Gabriel Agbonlahor's pull-back with a shot that drew a good save from Artur Boruc. With Villa showing more intent, Sherwood sent on Gestede in place of the Ayew – who struggled to make an impact - and the 26-year-old was quick to threaten the Bournemouth goal as he sent a volley just wide. Eddie Howe believed his Bournemouth side were the better team for large parts of the game against Villa Eddie Howe believed his Bournemouth side were the better team for large parts of the game against Villa And Sherwood's switch paid dividends in the 72nd minute when Gestede rose highest to power his header past Boruc. Gradel’s introduction by Howe almost paid off for Bournemouth as the Ivory Coast winger – who signed from Saint-Etienne last week – teed up Wilson, who saw a header towards goal cleared by Clark. But they couldn’t find a way through as Villa crashed Bournemouth's party to claim a valuable opening-day victory. Villa's Jordan Amavi (centre) lunges for the ball Soccer Saturday verdict - Phil Thompson Bournemouth tried to pass it from the back and build it from the middle, but they didn’t deliver enough from the flanks. They were getting there but there wasn’t enough quality coming into the box. They did well enough but I think Eddie Howe would be disappointed they didn’t create more. There wasn’t enough cutting edge but what it will have told them is when you get those chances at this level, you have to take that chance and they had the chances in the first half and Villa got very comfortable in the game. Sherwood was seeing they got on top in the game and they took Ayew off. He sensed the game was there for them. He got it absolutely spot on and it was a typical Gestede goal with his head. Jordan Amavi on the left hand side is a great player. Blistering pace, knocking it into space and he could do his job defensively. Gueye in midfield played very well. A lot of players were tiring but he didn’t.

After Ross Barkley cancelled out Miguel Layun’s opener, Odion Ighalo thought he had won it for Watford before Kone popped up to earn a point for Everton at the death. With six debutants in the Watford starting line-up, including three of the back four, there was an air of mystery about the Hornets heading into this game and they proved they belonged early on in an excellent first-half display. Everton manager Roberto Martinez was pleased with the character his team displayed to come back twice against newly promoted Watford Everton manager Roberto Martinez was pleased with the character his team displayed to come back twice against newly promoted Watford Everton had the better of the battle for possession in the early going but struggled to break through a very well-organised Watford defence and found themselves behind in the 14th minute. The Everton back four failed to deal with a cross flighted in from the left flank, allowing the ball to fall to Mexican midfielder Layun and he rifled into the bottom right-hand corner from 10 yards to stun the Goodison Park crowd. The home side tried to answer but became increasingly frustrated as the half wore on and Gareth Barry’s header from a corner, which Huerelho Gomes was forced to tip over, was as close they came to scoring. Miguel Layun celebrates scoring Watford's first goal with team-mate Etienne Capoue At the other end, Watford forward Troy Deeney was lucky to escape with only a yellow minutes before the break when he caught Brendan Galloway with a wild two-footed lunge after the young Everton defender cleared the ball. Layun almost doubled Watford’s lead on the stroke of half-time when he fired inches wide of the far post from the edge of the box with Tim Howard beaten. Roberto Martinez cannot have been impressed with his team’s first-half display and must have let his team know because they emerged for the second with far greater purpose. Watford manager Quique Flores was happy to take an opening day point at Goodison Park Watford manager Quique Flores was happy to take an opening day point at Goodison Park They were almost level soon after the interval when the ball worked its way to Barkley from a corner and he sent in a brilliant cross to the far post which Romelu Lukaku headed just wide. The home side threatened again soon after when Barkley found James McCarthy in the box with a clever reverse pass. The Irishman squared from the by-line but Watford just managed to scramble clear. Everton continued to dominate as the half wore on and fashioned another good chance on 68 minutes when Tom Cleverley found Kone unmarked with a brilliant cross from deep on the right flank but the substitute headed over. Odion Ighalo puts Watford back in front against Everton in the 83rd minute The Toffees’ pressure paid off on 76 minutes, however, as Kone laid the ball off to Barkley on the edge of the box and the young England midfielder smashed the ball into the top corner with the aid of a slight deflection. Everton might have been expected to push for the winner from there but Watford substitute Odion Ighalo had other ideas and had the visitors back in front on 83 minutes. Ighalo wrong-footed John Stones on the edge of the box with a skilful dip of his shoulder before evading another challenge from Phil Jagielka and firing low past Tim Howard. There was more drama to come and Kone earned a point for Everton when he combined well with Lukaku in the box before firing low into the bottom corner. Ross Barkley says he is looking to score more goals for Everton this season after his effort against Watford Ross Barkley says he is looking to score more goals for Everton this season after his effort against Watford Soccer Saturday reaction - Charlie Nicholas The way Watford played, the way they controlled the game in terms of pace and balance… a lot of these players are names we’ve heard but don’t really know much about. To fit them into a system quite quickly will be a surprise. The shape was good. They were a physical, powerful, athletic side. Good pace on the flanks. Today it was about shape, organisation, and simple passes. To be in front twice and come back and give away a draw to a fairly timid Everton team today will disappoint Quique Flores in particular but there was certainly a lot of positives. It was a stunning strike from Barkley to get them level but this Everton crowd are not happy with this team. They’re too slow, too cumbersome. When they hit it long they do not get the midfield support quick enough and didn’t see Barkley really until the goal. Lukaku disappointed me again.

Ranieri enjoyed a dream return to the Premier League as Leicester beat Sunderland 4-2 on the opening day of the season. In a fantastic first half for the Foxes, Jamie Vardy opened the scoring after 11 minutes before Riyad Mahrez netted twice, including a penalty, to make it 3-0. Jermain Defoe replied for the visitors on the hour mark at the King Power but Marc Albrighton soon restored Leicester's three-goal advantage. Claudio Ranieri says Leicester's performance was outstanding after they beat Sunderland 4-2 at the King Power Stadium Claudio Ranieri says Leicester's performance was outstanding after they beat Sunderland 4-2 at the King Power Stadium Even though Steven Fletcher gave Sunderland hope with a second goal in the 71st minute, the Foxes held out to secure a well-deserved victory. Leicester were the form side in the top-flight at the end of last season and despite changing manager in the summer they managed to continue their momentum into the 2015/16 campaign with an impressive display. Both sides handed debuts to new players, with Shinji Okazaki starting for the Foxes and Younes Kaboul and Jeremain Lens getting the nod for the visitors, who started quite brightly. Jamie Vardy: Opened the scoring at the King Power Stadium Defoe forced an early save from Kasper Schmeichel and Kaboul and Jack Rodwell both saw headers kept out by the Leicester keeper. But the hosts responded in superb style, taking the lead in the 11th minute when Vardy headed Albrighton’s free-kick across goal and into the far corner. Mahrez then saw a shot deflected wide before doubling Leicester's lead on 18 minutes when he flicked in a header from Albrighton's cross. Jermain Defoe reduces the deficit on the hour The Algerian international soon make it 3-0 as he was brought down in the box by Lee Cattermole and dispatched the subsequent penalty. Dick Advocaat responded by replacing Cattermole with Fletcher but it failed to give the visitors any foothold in the game before half-time. Danny Drinkwater almost added a fourth from distance when his effort was palmed away by Pantilimon. There was little Leicester let-up after the break and Mahrez continued to torment Sunderland as he turned a couple of defenders inside out before hitting the post 10 minutes after the restart. Pantilimon then saved from Vardy and Mahrez as Leicester threatened to embarrass the visitors. Sunderland manager Dick Advocaat believes his side were not sharp enough as his side suffered an opening day defeat to Leicester Sunderland manager Dick Advocaat believes his side were not sharp enough as his side suffered an opening day defeat to Leicester But they pulled a goal back against the run of play on 60 minutes when Adam Johnson slipped Defoe in to fire into the corner from 10 yards. Suddenly Defoe was alive and Schmeichel was forced into a smart low save two minutes later. However, Albrighton restored Leicester’s three-goal lead not long afterwards, firing home when when the visitors failed to clear Mahrez's cross properly. The goal rush continued five minutes later when Fletcher made it 4-2, heading into an empty net after Lens lobbed Schmeichel. It kept the Foxes on their toes but they held on for the win and Okazaki was denied a debut goal by Kaboul's block with four minutes left. Marc Albrighton restored the Foxes' three-goal advantage Soccer Saturday verdict - Paul Merson Okazaki was very good. He hasn’t got the pace of Vardy, Schlupp or Mahrez but he always holds the ball up. Great touches, great vision. Very impressive and I thought he was different class. Not big, he’s actually quite little but very good. Kaboul had an absolute shocker at the highest level. He didn’t know what day it was. I don’t know what Tottenham got for him but whatever they got for him... bank it quickly. Sunderland have got players who are going to cause problems to teams at the back. The problem is they’re just going to let in too many goals. They cannot defend and Pantiilimon can hold his head up and walk off because he was very good.

Goals from Wilfried Zaha, Damien Delaney and a Yohan Cabaye strike in stoppage time were enough to see off a Norwich side playing their first game back in the top flight after winning promotion via the play-offs last year. Substitute Nathan Redmond pulled one back for the Canaries after 68 minutes, ensuring a nervy end to the game for Alan Pardew’s side, but Cabaye’s goal was enough to wrap up all three points for the visitors. Norwich will feel aggrieved, however, after seeing a Cameron Jerome goal controversially disallowed and strong claims for a penalty waved away in stoppage time after Connor Wickham appeared to push Sebastien Bassong in the box. Alan Pardew was pleased with the manner in which Crystal Palace negotiated a tricky opening-day fixture away to Norwich Alan Pardew was pleased with the manner in which Crystal Palace negotiated a tricky opening-day fixture away to Norwich The hosts started the better of the two sides and had early chances to take the lead with Wes Hoolahan, Jonny Howson and Graham Dorrans all seeing a lot of the ball. Lewis Grabban gave Palace an early warning as he got on the end of Howson’s cross into the box, firing wide from close range, but the flag had gone up for offside. Dorrans and Steven Whittaker then combined beautifully as the full-back burst into the box to deliver a low cross but Grabban was stretching to reach it and could only poke the ball wide when he should have scored. Palace came into the game more as the first half became a little scrappy. Norwich players had already voiced their displeasure over a Glenn Murray tackle on Dorrans, with the striker lucky to escape any form of punishment, and there was another minor flashpoint when Jason Puncheon seemed to knock Whittaker off-balance as the pair chased the ball, with the Scotsman crashing painfully into Cabaye. Russel Martin (right) and Graham Dorrans of Norwich City appeal to referee Simon Hooper after a disallowed goal. Alex Tettey then picked up the first yellow card of the game for a mistimed tackle on Pape Souaré but, again, the Norwich players were quick to let the Palace left-back know they thought he had made a meal of the incident. Norwich were given a real wake-up call on the half-hour mark when Joel Ward kept a seemingly innocuous cross alive at the back post and his header down found Murray who prodded the ball towards goal from five yards but John Ruddy was equal to the effort. The hosts did not heed that warning, however, falling behind with seven minutes remaining in the first half and it was all thanks to Palace’s two wide men. Puncheon showed a bit of trickery and pace to get the better of Bassong down the right-hand side before picking out Zaha whose volley at the back post beat a scrambling Ruddy. Yohan Cabaye scored on his return to the Premier League for Crystal Palace. Norwich looked stunned after going behind and nearly lost another goal a moment later when Jordan Mutch forced a good stop from Ruddy with a powerful drive. Palace did not have to wait long into the second half to double their lead with a perfectly executed set piece straight off the training ground. Puncheon's long corner picked out Souaré who made a late run into the box completely unmarked and his header found Damien Delaney at the back post who knocked the ball into the net. That seemed to spark Norwich into life to some extent with Johnson’s header and then Whittaker’s long-range effort forcing McCarthy into decent stops. Nathan Redmond pulls a goal back for Norwich to make it 2-1 in the 69th minute They got a goal back out of nowhere with a little over 20 minutes remaining, however, when Redmond was allowed time and space on the edge of the Palace box and his long-range effort beat McCarthy down at his right-hand post. Substitute Jerome thought he had scored an equaliser for the hosts but referee Simon Hooper blew his whistle after ruling that the striker had used a high boot to turn the ball into the net as he challenged for the ball with Ward. Whittaker had an effort cleared off the line after his bouncing shot beat McCarthy before substitute Yannick Bolasie forced Ruddy into a good stop. Bassong was left furious in stoppage time after he appeared to be pushed in the back by Wickham as he looked to attack the ball in the air but Hooper again waved away the Norwich claims and protests. Cabaye then inflicted more pain on the already-infuriated Norwich players when he slipped the ball past Ruddy after being put through by James McArthur to wrap up the scoring and the three points for Palace. Norwich manager Alex Neil was left frustrated after the referee chose not to allow a Cameron Jerome goal during the defeat to Palace Norwich manager Alex Neil was left frustrated after the referee chose not to allow a Cameron Jerome goal during the defeat to Palace Soccer Saturday verdict - Matt Le Tissier Alex Neil can feel a bit aggrieved. Norwich started the game well and should have gone ahead. Norwich’s disallowed second goal was harsh. Early on in the game, certainly in the first 25-30 minutes, they were the more threatening side and then at 2-0 down they showed character to give it a go as well. Bolasie came on, Zaha went off who had a good chance. Conor Wickham came on when legs were tiring a little bit and I’m sure Alan Pardew will be very happy with how his squad is shaping up.

"Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho refused to comment on the sending off of goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho refused to comment on the sending off of goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois Thibaut Courtois was sent off as Chelsea started the defence of their Premier League title with a 2-2 draw against Swansea. Chelsea took an early lead through Oscar before Swansea debutant Andre Ayew equalised on 28 minutes. The visitors were level for just 90 seconds though as Federico Fernandez put through his own net. Courtois was dismissed on 52 minutes for denying Bafetimbi Gomis a clear goalscoring opportunity. Gomis then equalised past substitute 'keeper Asmir Begovic from the resulting penalty to complete the scoring. Jose Mourinho issued a surprise with his team selection by naming Diego Costa in his line-up after earlier claiming the striker was still struggling with the hamstring injury that ruled him out of the Community Shield. Costa scored a hat-trick against Swansea in the reverse fixture last season and he was closely guarded by Ashley Williams in the opening stages. However, that focus on Costa couldn’t stop Chelsea taking the lead on 22 minutes. Chelsea's Oscar celebrates his opening goal Oscar was the man to get the goal, fizzing in a cross-shot free-kick from the left flank which evaded everyone in the box and left Lukasz Fabianski a little flat-footed as the ball sailed past him into the far corner. Swansea were more than matching the champions in the early stages and it wasn’t a big surprise when new signing Ayew equalised. The lively Jefferson Montero made the hard yards down the left flank and floated a brilliant ball into the box that was headed at goal by Gomis. Jamie Redknapp does not think Thibaut Courtois denied a goalscoring opportunity in Chelsea’s 2-2 draw with Swansea. Jamie Redknapp does not think Thibaut Courtois denied a goalscoring opportunity in Chelsea’s 2-2 draw with Swansea. Courtois made a fine save but Ayew was on hand to force home the rebound at the second attempt. The teams were level for just 90 seconds though as Fernandez scored a very unfortunate own-goal. Willian attacked the Swansea centre-back down the left flank and looked to send over a cross into the middle. The ball deflected off the defender and looped over Fabianski into the same corner where Oscar had scored. The goal failed to deflate the Swans though, who came out all guns blazing after the break. Swansea manager Garry Monk says his side were excellent during their 2-2 draw with Chelsea and created great chances Swansea manager Garry Monk says his side were excellent during their 2-2 draw with Chelsea and created great chances Jonjo Shelvey hit a post straight from a corner and Montero was denied from close range by Courtois before the goalkeeper was involved in the game-changing moment. Gomis raced through on goal after being played onside by Willian and showed great pace to get to the ball before Courtois, who came flying out of his goal. There was clear contact on the striker and referee Michael Oliver was quick to point to the spot before brandishing a red card in the direction of the goalkeeper. Begovic had the chance to be an instant hero in front of new fans but Gomis confidently stroked the ball into the net from 12 yards. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho refused to comment on the sending off of goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho refused to comment on the sending off of goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois Swansea continued to press forward but Begovic stood strong to deny substitute Wayne Routledge from 15 yards. Radamel Falcao was introduced for his Premier League debut for Chelsea but the best he could muster was a weak shot from the edge of the box that Fabianski saved with ease. Saturday Night Football reaction - Jamie Redknapp Swansea got in so many times behind the defence. The Chelsea defending was lax, it wasn’t sharp, it wasn’t aggressive. It’s the first day of the season so we don’t want to get too carried away but, in terms of the champions, that was as poor a performance as you could see. Chelsea scored nine goals against Swansea last season but today the body language didn’t seem right. It seemed very flat. No doubt it (Courtois' foul) was a penalty, but I don’t think he was denying a goalscoring opportunity, I don’t think it’s a red card and I think Chelsea are really unlucky. The ball was going away from goal and I believe Gary Cahill could get back on the line. There’s a chance he can score but I think the ball has to be going directly at goal. Maybe the referee thought it was dangerous play, I don’t think it was. Penalty absolutely, but I think a red card is extremely harsh.
