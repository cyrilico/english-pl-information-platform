This time the target was not Arsène Wenger, the beleaguered manager, but Stan Kroenke, the majority shareholder. “Stan Kroenke, get out of our club” was the cry on the hour and it would get a series of airings, each one louder than the previous.\n\nThis was a seismic moment in Arsenal’s modern history. Nobody really expected Liverpool or Manchester City to slip up and allow Wenger and his team the chance to nip in and secure qualification to the Champions League, and they did not. And so, for the first time since 1997-98, Wenger and his club must move into a season without the spur of participation in Europe’s elite competition.\n\nArsenal fans turn on Stan Kroenke after ‘Spursdays’ finally arrive | Amy Lawrence Read more\n\nArsenal did what they had to do on the field – even after Laurent Koscielny was sent off in the 14th minute for a reckless challenge on Enner Valencia. The captain will be suspended for the FA Cup final against Chelsea on Saturday while Gabriel Paulista will surely be missing, too. The centre-half was taken off on a stretcher after jarring his left knee. “It doesn’t look too good,” Wenger said.\n\nArsenal led through Héctor Bellerin and Alexis Sánchez and although Everton pulled one back through Romelu Lukaku’s penalty and infuriated their manager, Ronald Koeman, with moments of profligacy – a theme of their season – Arsenal deserved the victory. Aaron Ramsey sealed it with a beautiful curler into the far, top corner in stoppage-time.\n\nThe Kroenke Out sentiment was the takeaway from another emotional day and it followed the publicising of his decision to reject a takeover bid worth £1bn from Alisher Usmanov, who holds a 30% stake in the club. If the timing of that story on Friday night was designed to push Kroenke under an uncomfortable spotlight, it achieved its ends.\n\nArsenal still have the Cup final and they have won eight of their past nine games, including the semi-final against Manchester City. Yet there could be no mistaking the flatness of the mood as the players ambled around their post-match lap of appreciation. Wenger watched from the mouth of the tunnel and this has to go down as his worst and most trying league campaign.\n\nWenger had promised that his team would fight until the end and they did so with 10 men, after Koscielny had gone through Valencia with a side-on slide tackle. It did not matter that there looked to be no malice. The challenge was late and there is no leeway when a defender gets it wrong like this.\n\nArsenal had scored early through Bellerin’s first goal of the season and it served to spare the blushes of his team‑mate Danny Welbeck, who had contrived to miss his kick from two yards out, following Mesut Özil’s cross from the left, and with an open goal gaping. Bellerin managed to shoot, on the rebound, into the still empty net.\n\nKoeman made a change on 26 minutes, sending on Ross Barkley and switching to a 4-4-2 formation. He knew his decision to start Barkley on the bench would set the tongues wagging, in the context of the midfielder’s contractual stand-off, and he said afterwards that he did not know if he would re-sign. Barkley is about to enter the final year on his deal. “I will speak to the board tomorrow and we will make a statement about that,” Koeman said.\n\nMoments after Barkley’s introduction, Arsenal extended their lead and it was a bizarrely simple goal, after Sánchez’s shot had hit Phil Jagielka and broken to Welbeck. Jagielka stayed down, Sánchez moved towards the six-yard box, nobody tracked him, Welbeck squared and Sánchez side-footed home. Sánchez would work Joel Robles with a free-kick and, while the Liverpool game remained goalless Arsenal could hope.\n\nThe closing stages of the first half were defined by Everton pressure and there was one moment of pinball inside the Arsenal area that finished with Petr Cech clutching gratefully in front of Lukaku. The Arsenal goalkeeper was further extended by Idrissa Gueye and Lukaku while the latter dragged a shot wide. The hammer blow for Arsenal, though, was the news at the end of the half that Liverpool had gone in front.\n\nLiverpool seal Champions League place with victory over Middlesbrough Read more\n\nRobles made a double save early in the second half from Welbeck and Özil while Gabriel suffered his misfortune when he stretched into a tackle on Valencia only to get his left leg stuck under his own body.\n\nTo add the insult, Michael Oliver would book him for the lunge and there were moments when the referee struggled to keep control. Oliver was correct, though, to award Everton their penalty, after Nacho Monreal had leaned towards Leighton Baines’s cross with his arm. Lukaku guided his kick past Cech.\n\nBy then, Liverpool were 3-0 up and the mood inside the Emirates Stadium had darkened, with the anti-Kroenke chants underscoring the occasion. Lukaku had a goal ruled out for climbing on the substitute Per Mertesacker, while Özil and another substitute, Alex Iwobi – on two occasions – could not finish. Ramsey showed them how but, by then, the focus had turned to off-the-field issues."}, {"date": "21/05/2017", "arena": "Turf Moor", "attendance": 21634, "home_team": {"name": "Burnley", "lineup": [{"name": "Tom Heaton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matthew Lowton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin Long", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Tarkowski", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stephen Ward", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Scott Arfield", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jeff Hendrick", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Westwood", "yellows": [26], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [78]}, {"name": "Robbie Brady", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [67]}, {"name": "Sam Vokes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [23], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andre Gray", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [78]}], "subs": [{"name": "Jon Flanagan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Barnes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [78], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Defour", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [78], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Johann Berg Gudmundsson", "yellows": [86], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [67], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tendayi Darikwa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nick Pope", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daniel Agyei", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "West Ham United", "lineup": [{"name": "Adrián", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "José Fonte", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Collins", "yellows": [17], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Angelo Ogbonna", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sam Byram", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Manuel Lanzini", "yellows": [42], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Edimilson Fernandes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Aaron Cresswell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robert Snodgrass", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [84]}, {"name": "Sofiane Feghouli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [27], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "André Ayew", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [72], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Darren Randolph", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Fletcher", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [84], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Domingos Quina", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Declan Rice", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Moses Makasi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daniel Kemp", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Sean Dyche claimed that the disappointment of losing on the final day would soon fade as he reflected on a fine season.\n\nBurnley were beaten 2-1 by West Ham United at Turf Moor as their first season back in the Premier League drew to a close, but their survival had already been guaranteed. That ensured the club would finish in their highest league position since 1975, whatever the outcome of this game.\n\nBurnley might even have started their season-ending party with a win had they built on Sam Vokes’s opening goal, but Sofiane Feghouli and André Ayew responded for the visitors.\n\nDyche said: “Your instinct as a manager is to search for that winning feeling every week, so that is the only disappointment today. That will fade quickly into what has been a very good and strong season.\n\n“It should have been out of sight at half-time. We had three unbelievably good chances and at this level you have to take them.\n\n“We scored a good goal and with the chances beyond that, if we score again, I think the game is in our control. Whilst it is in the balance you are never quite sure.\n\n“But the bigger picture is – we didn’t just achieve the goal, we’d got that done early on, against all the odds with a group of players who are still adapting, still trying to improve, still learning.\n\n“The disappointment I feel as a manager today will go away quickly because, overall, we were given no chance.”\n\nSuch was the good feeling around Turf Moor that one of the local pubs, the Princess Royal, was advertising free drinks for Dyche. “I don’t mind a little half a shandy – so that may cost them a few quid!” Dyche joked.\n\nBurnley were without the highly rated defender Michael Keane because of injury, and Dyche could not guarantee that the 24-year-old would still be at the club next term.\n\nThe manager said: “The one thing we know is we are in a strong position. He has got a year to run on his contract.\n\n“If nothing happens that is suitable for us, then he will carry on playing. We will wait and see what the summer brings.”\n\nWest Ham’s victory brought a pleasing end to what has been a disappointing campaign after the seventh-placed finish last year. The Hammers took time to settle after their move to the London Stadium last summer and injuries then undermined their progress. The result took them to a final position of 11th.\n\nSlaven Bilic, the West Ham manager, said: “It is always nice to finish a season with a win or a good performance and we got both today. We deserved to win. We knew, like any other club here, we were going to have problems but we coped well with them.\n\n“We played really nice football. We created a lot of clear-cut chances and even more than that. I am really pleased with the way we played.

Passages of this occasion were heavily choreographed, from John Terry’s substitution as the clocks on the big screens at either end of the arena displayed 26 minutes to the post-match hoisting of the Premier League trophy. Others, like Sunderland’s utter capitulation, might as well have been. Throw in a golden glove for Thibaut Courtois and this was as close to the perfect afternoon as the locals could ever have envisaged.\n\nIt has been an exemplary season. Each of Chelsea’s champions was cheered as he stepped forward on to the plinth, erected on the centre-spot here, to be rewarded for a year when everyone at this club has bought into the manager’s mantra of “work, work, work”. Antonio Conte was hidden at the back of the throng, stage right, when Gary Cahill and Terry finally hoisted the trophy and the pyrotechnics, streamers and ticker tape exploded all around. It is not his style to hog the limelight, even if the players soon sought him out. The champagne sprayed thereafter probably ruined the Italian’s second suit of the day given he had already been drenched, albeit largely in energy drinks and water, at the final whistle.\n\nLiverpool seal Champions League place with victory over Middlesbrough Read more\n\nPerhaps the most remarkable aspect of the afternoon was that Terry, a player who has always worn his heart on his sleeve, kept it together until well over half an hour after the final whistle and they had finished playing the montage of his greatest moments. He finally cracked when he had the microphone in hand and, with the home support hanging on his every word, was addressing “one of the most difficult days of my life”. He offered thanks to those he has worked under and with and to Roman Abramovich, up in his box, who “really cares about this football club from the under-8s to the first team”.\n\nThe sight of his wife and children in tears finally pushed him over the edge, the speech rather stumbling as he faced those up in the Matthew Harding stand. “Lastly, you guys the fans, the best supporters in the world without a shadow of a doubt,” he said. “You’ve given me everything from the age of 17 when I first started out. You picked me up when I was down, sung my name when I’ve had bad days and disappointed you as well. [Saying] thank you will never ever be enough but I tell you: I’ll be back here one day. I’m going to be supporting the players and the club from the bottom of my heart. I love you all.” Thank you and goodnight.\n\nThe farewell ceremony had in effect begun far earlier in the afternoon when, at about 3.26pm, Conte delivered a nod and a wink from the sidelines, Diego Costa passed on the message to a pre-warned Jordan Pickford, and the goalkeeper obligingly sliced the ball out of play. The fourth official duly lifted the substitutes’ board and Terry’s time, as well as his number, was up. There were hand claps and hugs with all his team-mates, with the Chelsea players meandering over to the touchline to form a guard of honour for the departing captain. By the time Terry actually made it off the pitch, via a ceremonial transfer of the armband to Cahill, the game was closer to 29 minutes old.\n\nDavid Moyes later admitted Sunderland had been aware of the plan and did not seem offended that a Premier League contest had descended into stage-managed sentimentality. It was not as if Chelsea were setting a precedent. This was Terry’s 717th appearance for this club, 580th as captain, and 345th and last at Stamford Bridge, with 15 major trophies claimed over 22 years on the books. The club may never see his like again. If anything had rested on the game, then it might have been less appropriate. Yet Chelsea are champions and Sunderland had long since been condemned. The locals would not have had it any other way.\n\nIn truth the whole occasion was always more celebration than contest. The visitors had joined in themselves for a while, thankful a miserable season was finally drawing to a conclusion. Javier Manquillo had volleyed them into an early lead while Terry was still on the pitch, though they were never likely to end life in the top flight on a rare high. Willian, belting a shot through Pickford after Marcos Alonso had struck the angle of post and bar with a free-kick, swiftly drew Chelsea level before Sunderland wilted completely in the final half-hour.\n\nEden Hazard scythed the champions ahead, then, with the visitors broken, Cesc Fàbregas’ pass was nodded over the on-rushing goalkeeper by Joleon Lescott with Pedro sprinting on to the loose ball to head into the unguarded net. The concession was farcical and the substitute Michy Batshuayi was then permitted to add his own brace in the dying moments.\n\nManchester City secure third place as Sergio Agüero torments Watford Read more\n\nMoyes is due to meet the Sunderland owner, Ellis Short, at his Chelsea home on Monday with his own future as manager up for discussion. His tenure has been traumatic to date.\n\n“I’m gutted we’ve been relegated and really disappointed with the way the season has gone,” he said. “But what do you do? Football has winners and there are people who lose.”\n\nChelsea, with the FA Cup final still to come, fall into the former bracket. There were other departures to note here, with Steve Holland serenaded by the crowd and thanked publicly by Terry as he leaves to join Gareth Southgate’s England staff on a full-time basis. Costa, too, had made a point of waving to all sides of the arena, fuelling suggestions his three-year stint at the club could also be over. The Brazilian spent the last half-hour mucking about on the bench, squirting the coaching staff with bottles of water and frantically signalling to Courtois that Hugo Lloris had conceded at Hull to ensure the Belgian’s 16 clean sheets could not be caught.

"report": "Harry Kane scored a hat-trick, Hull City fans implored Marco Silva to stay on as their manager and the fluency of Tottenham Hotspur’s play offered tantalising hints of what might have been.\n\nWith Kane securing the Golden Boot by taking his Premier League goal tally to 29 this season and Dele Alli shining brightly in the hazy East Yorkshire sunshine, already relegated Hull were thoroughly outclassed by visitors who, until fairly recently, had entertained hopes of securing the title here.\n\nIt was not to be and they, eventually, had to settle for second place but next season Mauricio Pochettino’s side will surely be parking their tanks on Chelsea’s lawn.\n\nOn this evidence the real mystery is how on earth Spurs are currently bereft of silverware. “We’ve finished the way we want to finish – fantastically,” Pochettino said. “I’m very happy for Harry, it’s an amazing achievement and we’ve shown we’ve learnt from last season.\n\nManchester City secure third place as Sergio Agüero torments Watford Read more\n\n“We’ve improved, mentally we’re tougher. Our level is now higher and it’s a good platform. Now we must move on, try to improve the squad and challenge to win trophies next season.”\n\nThis time last year his team surrendered 5-1 to already relegated Newcastle United at St James’ Park, where the action was played out against a repetitive soundtrack of “Rafa Benítez, we want you to stay”.\n\nTwelve months on and 100 miles to the south, there was a distinct sense of deja vu in the humid air. “Marco Silva, we want you to stay,” chorused the KCom Stadium as the Portuguese coach who had so nearly rescued Hull from relegation paced his technical area.\n\nAs the scoreline rather cruelly emphasises, that was where the similarities ended. Unlike Benítez, Silva seems unlikely to listen to those pleas, with the much admired young manager courted by many clubs including Watford and, possibly, Southampton. He is widely expected to announce his departure by Wednesday.\n\n“It’s not the moment to talk now,” he said, before hinting that his heart and head are sending him conflicting messages. “Of course, I feel the supporters’ love,” he said. “It was an amazing moment for me but I need to analyse what’s best for me and the club. I have to analyse not only with my heart. I need to think. I have to decide what’s best. Now is not the moment to talk.”\n\nLiverpool seal Champions League place with victory over Middlesbrough Read more\n\nHe was a little less reticent about the performance. “I’m disappointed,” Silva said. “We didn’t play well. The only positive thing was our supporters, they deserved something really different. I feel they’re deserving something more. They’ve been amazing for the last few months. It was a difficult moment for me.”\n\nAnxious to confirm his status as the top tier’s leading scorer for a second successive season, Kane swiftly scored his 27th goal of the campaign. When Eric Dier seized possession and Christian Eriksen’s pass confounded the new-look home back five, Kane found himself in space on the edge and drove a low, left-foot shot beyond David Marshall.\n\nGoal No28 was not far behind. This time, Kane tapped in from close rangeafter connecting with Kieran Trippier’s volleyed cross at the conclusion of a move instigated by Dier’s high-calibre diagonally chipped pass.\n\nWith half-time approaching Kane turned creator, playing in Son Heung-min whose cut-back found Dele Alli. All that remained was for Alli to take a steadying touch before directing a shot past Marshallwho might have been beginning to regret Silva’s decision to offer him a rare start.\n\nRecognising that his players could not cope with the sharpness, rapidity and sheer imagination of Ali’s movement, Hull’s manager had some thinking to do at the interval. His team re-emerged in a reconfigured, back four, guise with Kamil Grosicki having replaced Curtis Davies. It prompted a slight improvement, manifested by the conjuring of a handful of half chances.\n\nThey even scored a goal when Oumar Niasse’s shot was blocked and Sam Clucas’s deflected left-foot shot beat Hugo Lloris but any Humberside joy was quickly cancelled out when Victor Wanyama responded by heading home Eriksen’s free-kick. It was the Dane’s 14th assist of a stellar season.\n\nAlli then cued Kane up for a treble, completed courtesy of another left-foot shot which squirmed under Marshall. “It will be a challenge for Harry to try to score 30 goals next season,” said Pochettino, who watched approvingly.\n\nBen Davies extended his own left boot by lashing the afternoon’s most eye-catching goal past Hull’s goalkeeper from just outside the area. “We want seven,” demanded the visiting fans and Toby Alderweireld duly obliged, turning in Trippier’s cross. “Are you watching, Arsenal,” roared those approving Spurs supporters as Silva headed straight down the tunnel."}, {"date": "21/05/2017", "arena": "The King Power Stadium", "attendance": 32000, "home_team": {"name": "Leicester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Kasper

That was not enough to lift last season’s champions into the top half of the table, nor even to finish above Bournemouth, whose season has been a triumph.\n\nGiven that Leicester were in the relegation zone when Craig Shakespeare presided over his first match after Claudio Ranieri’s dismissal in February, the club’s caretaker manager has made a strong case for being appointed on a full-time basis. Shakespeare hopes to find out soon about his employers’ intentions. “It’s out of my hands,” the 53-year-old said. “When I’ll get the phone call I don’t know but I’m sure there’ll be a meeting soon. There is no set date. They are very good business people and I’m sure they appreciate that you, me and everybody is waiting and I’m sure we’ll get a decision soon.”\n\nShakespeare believes he has “grown into the role” but said he would not necessarily leave the club if asked to revert to being an assistant in the event of the top job being assigned to somebody else. “I have a contract as an assistant manager after this one, it would be foolish of me to say ‘I’m not going to do this, I’m not going to do that’ because I’m not in that position,” he said. “It’s up for discussion.”\n\nAlthough Leicester ended the campaign with 37 points fewer than last season and were thrashed 6-1 by Tottenham Hotspur on Thursday, there was a festive mood around the King Power Stadium before and after kickoff – and not only because the club’s chairman, Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, arranged free drinks for fans. There is a sense that the good times have not gone from Leicester despite the feeble title defence and the painful separation from Ranieri. This campaign also brought, after all, a historic march to the quarter-finals of the Champions League and generally encouraging performances under Shakespeare.\n\nBut the home fans’ faith was tested here when Junior Stanislas scored after 57 seconds. Lys Mousset took advantage of clumsy defending before his shot was deflected into the path of Stanislas, who tapped in from close range. Kasper Schmeichel then made an excellent one-handed save from a shot by Dan Gosling to prevent Bournemouth from stretching their lead.\n\nLeicester got their act together towards the end of the first half and broke Bournemouth’s resistance six minutes into the second. Ben Chilwell floated the ball in from the left to the back post, Islam Slimani nodded it back across goal and Jamie Vardy finished from close range. Vardy and Slimani had chances to complete the comeback but could not to do so.\n\nManchester City secure third place as Sergio Agüero torments Watford Read more"}, {"date": "21/05/2017", "arena": "Anfield", "attendance": 53191, "home_team": {"name": "Liverpool", "lineup": [{"name": "Simon Mignolet", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathaniel Clyne", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joel Matip", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dejan Lovren", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Milner", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [86]}, {"name": "Emre Can", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Georginio Wijnaldum", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [45], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Philippe Coutinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [51], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Lallana", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [56], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daniel Sturridge", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [82]}, {"name": "Roberto Firmino", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [79]}], "subs": [{"name": "Loris Karius", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marko Grujic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ragnar Klavan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alberto Moreno", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [86], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lucas Leiva", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [79], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Divock Origi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [82], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Trent Alexander-Arnold", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Middlesbrough", "lineup": [{"name": "Brad Guzan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fabio Da Silva", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [73]}, {"name": "Calum Chambers", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Gibson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "George Friend", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Grant Leadbitter", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Clayton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Forshaw", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Patrick Bamford", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rudy Gestede", "yellows": [56], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [73]}, {"name": "Stewart Downing", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Dimitrios Konstantopoulos", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daniel Ayala", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [73], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bernardo Espinosa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Álvaro Negredo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [73], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Viktor Fischer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marten de Roon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Stuani", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Jürgen Klopp described the end of the season as though it were a beginning for Liverpool. A place in the Champions League play-offs was secured with nerves, guile and ultimately some comfort against Middlesbrough as Klopp’s first full season at Anfield finished with a merited place in the top four. It bodes well for the club that the manager immediately wanted more.\n\n“Liverpool needs to be there consistently,” Klopp said of the Champions League proper. “In the last 10 years Liverpool was not a part of it too often. We should do everything to change this.”\n\nLiverpool heed Jürgen Klopp and sprint into Champions League | Paul Wilson Read more\n\nAugust, when the five-times European Cup winners will be seeded for the play-off draw, will provide the first opportunity. Having exhilarated at times this season, dug in when required and rediscovered their clinical touch on home soil on the final day, a ticket to the Champions League represents deserved reward for Liverpool’s varying qualities and a campaign of genuine progress under the former Borussia Dortmund coach.\n\nThree goals in 11 minutes either side of half-time gave Klopp’s team the victory needed to guarantee a top four finish. Georginio Wijnaldum ignited Anfield with the crucial breakthrough before Philippe Coutinho and Adam Lallana put the game beyond Steve Agnew’s relegated side, who caused frequent problems to Dejan Lovren and the Liverpool defence before half-time before being swatted aside.\n\nThe Liverpool manager had claimed beforehand that he would not have settled for a Champions League decider on the final day at the start of the season as he dreams of “the biggest things”. But it provides firm evidence of Liverpool’s progress under his management that the European elite beckons for only the second time in eight years. Klopp will fly with the Liverpool squad to Sydney on Monday for a lucrative post-season friendly. Australia welcomes a club who are now a far more attractive proposition to potential signings.\n\nLucas Leiva gave what sounded suspiciously like a farewell address after the final whistle while Daniel Sturridge, another player who may depart this summer, posed for photographs with family members in front of the Kop during the squad’s lap of honour. Otherwise, Liverpool are likely to be strengthened significantly by the time they next appear at Anfield.\n\nWijnaldum’s sixth league goal of the season released a tension that had been rising throughout the first half in the stands and had begun to effect Liverpool’s performance on the pitch. Klopp’s team dominated possession from the start, forcing Middlesbrough’s formation to morph into a 6-3-1 and a test of Liverpool’s patience against another deep defence, in which Ben Gibson again impressed. But a lack of composure on the ball and penetration generated audible and increasing groans around Anfield until one strike in first-half stoppage time changed the atmosphere and the context of Liverpool’s campaign completely.\n\nLiverpool, with Coutinho dictating proceedings back in central midfield, should have started an ultimately comfortable passage into the Champions League with their first meaningful attack. James Milner’s cross fell to Nathaniel Clyne of all people and, although the two full-backs’ adventure underlined Klopp’s intent, the defender dragged an inviting chance horribly wide. Emre Can, Coutinho and Sturridge all went close before, with the home performance deteriorating, one moment of quality changed everything.\n\nManchester City secure third place as Sergio Agüero torments Watford Read more\n\nA perfectly weighted flick from Roberto Firmino sent Wijnaldum sprinting between Gibson and George Friend into the penalty area. The Dutch international, who had instigated the move, opted for power and beat Brad Guzan at his near post with a blistering finish into the Kop goal. Liverpool regained fourth place from Arsenal with the midfielder’s fine finish and Champions League qualification was never in doubt thereafter.\n\nIt could, arguably should, have been a more complicated equation for Klopp’s team, however. Lovren endured a nerve-stricken afternoon and appeared to have conceded a penalty and invited a red card when he tangled with Patrick Bamford in the 22nd minute. Bamford was clean through on goal after exchanging passes with Adam Forshaw when he went to ground under pressure from Lovren. The Liverpool defender’s arm did make contact but referee Martin Atkinson, perhaps swayed by the ease with which Bamford collapsed, waved play on. The Middlesbrough bench were incandescent at Liverpool’s reprieve.\n\n“I thought it was a definite penalty,” Agnew said. “Patrick was the wrong side of the defender and I thought it was a definite penalty.” Even Klopp, while repeating his argument that many decisions have gone against Liverpool this season, admitted: “Maybe it was a penalty but I haven’t seen it again.”\n\nAfter the high anxiety of the first half, the second was a procession into the Champions League for Liverpool. Coutinho swept a trademark free-kick over the Boro wall and beyond an unconvincing Guzan dive into the bottom corner within six minutes of the restart. Shortly afterwards, on a counter-attack from a Middlesbrough corner, Lallana made it three with a comfortable finish.

"José Mourinho fielded a side featuring a number of youngsters and appeared to come through Manchester United’s final domestic game with no injuries before the Europa League final against Ajax in Stockholm on Wednesday night.\n\nThe one question is whether Paul Pogba was taken off just before half-time to rest him or because of a problem. The midfielder’s body language suggested it was the former and he appeared on the pitch after the final whistle.\n\nThe one odd note was Mourinho skipping his media duties. He gave the club’s in-house broadcaster, MUTV, a 17-second interview. “Don’t ask me too many things because now I am in a final,” he said. “Let me go home, I am in a final now.” Asked if he knows the side to face Ajax, he said: “I know, but let me go. I am in a final now.”\n\nAs Mourinho also entered the press room while most journalists were still watching the players’ lap of honour, nothing could be confirmed about the condition of Pogba, who scored United’s second goal and the Portuguese declined a chance to praise some fine performances from his starlets, with Josh Harrop scoring on his debut.\n\nPlay Video 0:25 José Mourinho press conference lasts just 10 seconds after Manchester United win – video\n\nThis may have been Wayne Rooney’s last United match and the sign of the changing times for the club’s record scorer was illustrated in another anonymous performance. On being substituted two minutes from the end, making way for the 16-year-old Angel Gomes to make his debut, Rooney was given a standing ovation but the harsh truth is that he is a shadow of the player who signed for the club in 2004.\n\nBefore the match Graeme Souness had claimed that the United manager’s serial complaining about fixture congestion gave United players excuses for poor displays. Mourinho’s response was curt: “A pundit is not honest if they cannot forget their colours. It’s not my fault if their managerial career was poor.”\n\nWhile Sam Allardyce brought James McArthur and Patrick van Aanholt into his lineup in place of Yohan Cabaye and Andros Townsend, Mourinho gave four full debuts. Joel Pereira, Demetri Mitchell, Scott McTominay and Harrop were all named in a starting XI with an average age of 22, United’s youngest of the Premier League era.\n\nThe new boys started well: from left-back Mitchell curved a sweet 40-yard pass to Rooney, but the striker’s attempted dink over the Palace keeper, Wayne Hennessey, was too high.\n\nMitchell said: “Beforehand, Paul Pogba, [Michael] Carrick, Phil Jones, were helping a lot. They give you confidence and helped me a lot in the game. After the game, I was thinking, ‘This is what it’s all about, it’s what dreams are made of.’ I hope to play many more games at Old Trafford.”\n\nHarrop, who is 21, had given notice of his skill by winning a corner with some neat footwork and he followed that up soon afterwards with a memorable debut goal. Receiving a deft outside-of-the foot pass from Pogba, the Stockport-born midfielder moved forward, cut inside, fashioned a snake-hips swivel to evade Martin Kelly and then produced an excellent right-foot finish to beat Hennessey. Cue a delirious celebration that had Harrop making an imaginary phone call and rushing to the left corner flag as his team-mates engulfed him.\n\nMitchell said: “He scored a hat-trick last Monday, he had two similar goals in that, and you could see his confidence from that game.”\n\nManchester United’s Daley Blind puts old ties behind him for Europa League final Read more\n\nAt the end of the first half, Michael Carrick came on for Pogba and moments later Anthony Martial entered for Jesse Lingard. Allardyce may have given his men a rocket at the interval because they started the second half seeming to mean business. The ball was passed quickly to Wilfried Zaha, who had Carrick flailing at his cross.\n\nEric Bailly had been momentarily injured near the end of the opening period and when the centre-back took another knock it looked as though the 20-year-old Matthew Willock was about to make his debut, but Mourinho waved him back to his seat when Bailly insisted on playing on.\n\nAfter Christian Benteke fired a shot past the post, United continued to stroll through the contest by playing keep-ball. If this was indeed Rooney’s swan song he will be relieved that his attempted stabbed clearance from a free-kick went over rather than under Joel Pereira’s crossbar.\n\nThe latter stages featured a Pereira save from Luka Milivojevic’s free-kick earning a thumbs-up from Mourinho. It was that type of day.

Despite guiding the club to an eighth-place finish, Saints will discuss Puel’s position at an end-of-season review planned to take place next week, and the club’s hierarchy were present to witness Peter Crouch’s winner earning Stoke a first away win since January.\n\nLiverpool seal Champions League place with victory over Middlesbrough Read more\n\nIn his programme notes, Puel said he hoped his team would “really kick on next season” although he may be deprived of the chance to do so with them. His substitutions were heavily jeered and some sections of home fans booed Puel, who was accompanied by a security guard, and his assistant, Eric Black, during a post-match lap of appreciation that was always destined to be painful for all parties. The Frenchman, appointed last summer, refused to criticise Southampton supporters but made an impassioned defence of the job he has undertaken.\n\n“The fans wanted to win, they wanted goals, they wanted all these things to finish the season and it is normal,” Puel said of the reaction at full-time. “The fans sometimes are not satisfied but for us it is the same. I think it is difficult with all these games, all these competitions, all these injuries. I want to stay with all the positives and to finish eighth in the table, my players made fantastic work all the season. I repeat: eighth in the table is good.”\n\nThe watching Saints chairman, Ralph Krueger, chief executive Les Reed and owner Katharina Liebherr were probably not best pleased either following another fruitless performance.\n\nAfter 53 games over a long season the overwhelming issue has been on home turf, where Saints have won only six league matches and struggled for goals, setting a record here after failing to score in five successive home matches. It is now more than seven hours since Saints last celebrated a goal in front of their own supporters.\n\n“When I make a debrief, it’s not a debrief about one game, it’s a debrief about the season,” Puel said when asked if he needed a result ahead of next week’s meeting. “The good things, the difficult things. It’s a balance of the season to see what we can improve. It was a good challenge, for all the team, all the squad, all my staff. Now we want to come back to try to find European games for the season after.”\n\nSouthampton dominated the first half, with Stoke often second-best and sloppy in possession, but the visitors did see Mame Biram Diouf’s goal-bound header cleared off the line by Cédric Soares on the brink of half-time. Moments later Saints went tantalisingly close, with Nathan Redmond’s attempted lob on Jack Butland rattling the crossbar after the Stoke goalkeeper was caught in possession.\n\nAt times Southampton supporters did not know whether to laugh or cry as the ball repeatedly fizzed in from either flank but with no end product to show for it. Charlie Austin, making his first start since December following a shoulder injury, cut a frustrated figure. The lack of bite in front of goal was painful, verging on comical.\n\nAfter passing up countless half-chances, then came the inevitable. When Geoff Cameron marauded forward down the right his deep cross was met by Crouch, the 36-year-old and one-time Southampton forward, who towered above Soares to nod home his 10th goal of the season.\n\nPremier League clockwatch: Watford v Manchester City and more - as it happened Read more\n\n“We all know if you give Crouchy the service then he is the best in the business at what he does,” Mark Hughes, the Stoke manager, said. “He has not played a lot of games in terms of starts but if you look at his goals-to-games ratio, it is brilliant.”\n\nPuel had to act and act fast, summoning Sofiane Boufal and Manolo Gabbiadini in place of Dusan Tadic and Charlie Austin, a decision that led Saints supporters to further vent their anger towards the Southampton manager.\n\nSaints rallied but Butland matched their every move with a series of stupendous stops. He made a superb double-save before denying Gabbiadini one-on-one, and finally Boufal, by which point the damage – increasingly lasting for Puel – was already done."}, {"date": "21/05/2017", "arena": "The Liberty Stadium", "attendance": 20889, "home_team": {"name": "Swansea City", "lineup": [{"name": "Kristoffer Nordfeldt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Naughton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Federico Fernandez", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alfie Mawson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Olsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leroy Fer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [81]}, {"name": "Leon Britton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [66]}, {"name": "Tom Carroll", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordan Ayew", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [72], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Fernando Llorente", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [86], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gylfi Sigurdsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Jordi Amat", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sung-Yueng Ki", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [81], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Cork", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gerhard Tremmel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Luciano Narsingh", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [66], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stephen Kingsley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Oliver McBurnie", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "West Bromwich Albion", "lineup": [{"name": "Ben Foster", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Craig Dawson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonny Evans", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [33], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marc Wilson", "yellows": [51], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Allan Nyom", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Darren Fletcher", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Claudio Yacob", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jake Livermore", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [79]}, {"name": "Chris Brunt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Morrison", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [84]}, {"name": "Salomón Rondón", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Hal Robson-Kanu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [84], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Boaz Myhill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James McClean", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [79], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nacer Chadli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonathan Leko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sam Field", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kane Wilson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "The only disappointment for Swansea City is that the season has come to an end.

It will be impossible for them to ignore their need to improve. Pep Guardiola is unlikely to treat himself to a summer of relaxation after enduring the first trophyless season of his managerial career, even though it ended with City securing automatic passage into the group stage of the Champions League thanks to a brutal evisceration of Watford.\n\nThey ruined Walter Mazzarri’s farewell in classic Guardiola style, with killer passing, kaleidoscopic movement and wondrous skill, but a squad containing such a vast array of talents must aim higher than third place. They must produce football of this quality on a weekly basis and prove that they possess the durability required to handle the pressure of a title race. “We finished 15 points behind Chelsea,” Guardiola said. “We have to play better.”\n\nHarry Kane hat-trick secures Golden Boot as Tottenham hit Hull for seven Read more\n\nFor City’s idealistic manager, that means greater refinement and poise. Despite facing criticism during his first year in England, Guardiola made it clear that he will not betray his principles. “We are going to try to play better,” he said. “It is the only way to improve. Not tackles. Not running harder. To play better.”\n\nIt seemed that City might win the title at a canter after the Guardiola era opened with six consecutive triumphs in the league, but that start turned out to be a deception once the first cracks in this gifted but flawed team appeared and momentum slipped away. They have underachieved in a manner that their owners cannot have envisaged when they tempted the most coveted coach in Europe to Manchester and there will be changes this summer. Pablo Zabaleta will leave on a free transfer and the defender could be followed by Willy Caballero, Bacary Sagna, Gaël Clichy, Jesús Navas and Yaya Touré, who shared a warm embrace with Guardiola after the final whistle. “I said thank you for everything,” Guardiola said. “It was an outstanding performance.”\n\nPlayers such as Touré represent City’s past. While Guardiola insisted that he will not sell Sergio Agüero, whose first-half double lifted his tally to 32 goals in all competitions, this squad needs refreshing. It felt unsatisfactory that City arrived at Vicarage Road still unsure of a top-four place.\n\nOn a warm afternoon in Hertfordshire, however, they could not have asked for more obliging hosts than Watford, who lined up with a midfielder in central defence because of injury problems, a callow teenager at left-back and two goalkeepers on the bench. If this was Mazzarri’s attempt to make his bosses row back on their decision not to give him a new contract, it backfired badly. Watford’s players hardly broke sweat and Mazzarri did little to endear himself to the home fans by naming Troy Deeney among the substitutes. The Italian received loud boos on the one occasion when he stepped into his technical area.\n\nWatford’s huddle moments before kick-off fooled nobody. Perhaps they were discussing their holiday plans. It was a disingenuous attempt to prove their commitment to the cause and it looked utterly ridiculous once the game began.\n\nCity let their sublime football do the talking and Watford held out for five minutes, Kevin de Bruyne swinging in a corner from the right for Vincent Kompany to thump a header past Heurelho Gomes. The marking was pathetic.\n\nJosé Holebas had already cleared a Gabriel Jesus header off the line in the first minute and Watford’s response to falling behind was feeble. Valon Behrami was hopelessly out of depth alongside Holebas in defence and Brandon Mason, making his first league start, was powerless to stop Jesus on the left. M’Baye Niang’s failure to track back hardly helped the 19-year-old left-back, whose frailties were horribly exposed when Fernandinho charged past him on the way to scoring City’s fourth goal four minutes before half-time.\n\nChelsea dispatch Sunderland in style to bid John Terry a fond farewell Read more\n\nMazzarri’s demise will not be mourned in these parts, although he defended his work this season. “When we reached 40 points, we were 10th,” he said. “A less experienced manager would have done worse.”\n\nYet this was one of the most inept performances from any team in any league this season. Watford offered no resistance and De Bruyne had an embarrassing amount of space to glide into when he turned away from Abdoulaye Doucouré in the 23rd minute before releasing Agüero, who swept a low finish beyond Gomes.\n\nDavid Silva, as majestic as ever, created City’s third goal with a pass that sent Leroy Sané tearing away from Daryl Janmaat. Sané unselfishly squared for Agüero to tap home his second.\n\nAgüero had chances to complete his hat-trick in the second half, but the Argentinian did play a pivotal role in City’s fifth. Watford had briefly raised their level after half-time, with Stefano Okaka forcing Caballero to make his only save with a powerful drive from the left and Niang shooting wide from a tight angle, yet City soon quelled any suggestions of an unlikely uprising. Agüero burst past Mason on the right and his chip found Jesus, who controlled expertly before scooping the ball over Gomes.\n\nTo their credit, Watford’s supporters stuck around to applaud their team during the lap of honour after the final whistle. “You give us a bit of shit from time to time,” Deeney said. “But we deserve it.”"}, {"date": "18/05/2017", "arena": "The King Power Stadium",

title to show their class, although Tottenham Hotspur do crave one. Spurs demonstrated their excellence at the King Power by swatting aside last season’s champions with regal aplomb and, in the process, Harry Kane struck four goals to enhance his chances of being crowned as the Premier League’s top scorer for the second season in a row. His tally for the campaign stands at 26, two more than Everton’s Romelu Lukaku with one round of matches to go. Spurs cannot catch Chelsea but they have no intention of stopping their glory hunt.\n\nLeicester City v Tottenham Hotspur: Premier League – live! Read more\n\nSon Heung-min contributed to the rout here by scoring Tottenham’s other two goals. That amounted to six damaging blows to Craig Shakespeare’s prospects of landing the Leicester managerial job on a permanent basis. Ben Chilwell scored for the home team but that was no consolation to their caretaker manager. “There are no positives,” said Shakespeare. “We were totally second-best.”\n\nShakespeare should not be judged too harshly on this performance, as the main cause of this thrashing was Tottenham’s exceptional slickness – and their encouraging bloodlust. Mauricio Pochettino had demanded his team maintain their high standards despite the title being beyond them. They had faded at a similar stage last season once Leicester got beyond their reach so the Argentinian wanted to see evidence of a positive evolution since then. His wish was granted, and this time Leicester were left looking like a rabble.\n\n“Our attitude and internal motivation was good,” said Pochettino. “We have been talking a lot about why we finished so badly last season. This type of performance shows that the team is improving and has learned a lot from last season. This is fantastic.”\n\nLeicester made the better start but began to tremble as soon as Spurs bared their teeth. That was the beginning of a nightmare for Yohan Benalouane, in particular, as the centre-back was made to look ditzy by Spurs’ artful attackers. Especially Kane. The striker threatened to open the scoring a couple of times before he eventually did so in the 25th minute.\n\nToby Alderweireld exposed flat-footedness in Leicester’s rejigged defence by dropping a long pass over them from deep inside his own half. Christian Fuchs, a makeshift centre-back, failed to cut it out and Benalouane undermined the offside scheme. Son took advantage, scampering on to the ball before playing a square pass to Kane, who scored from close range.\n\nSpurs began to run amok. They increased their lead 11 minutes later with a sumptuous goal, an intricate move culminating with Dele Alli scooping the ball over the head of Benalouane before Son swept a volley into the net from 10 yards.\n\nAt half-time Shakespeare had to find a way to stop the bleeding, at least. He introduced Islam Slimani for Shinji Okazaki and Leicester made a strong start to the second period. In the 59th minute their revolt gathered momentum when Chilwell scored with impressive composure. Hugo Lloris had rushed out of his box to intercept a pass to Jamie Vardy but Leicester kept possession and when the ball was played to Chilwell, the 20-year-old sidestepped a defender and stroked it into the net from 12 yards despite Eric Dier’s attempt to clear off the line.\n\nBelief in a home comeback lasted four minutes. That is how long it took Spurs to re-establish their superiority. Alderweireld cantered down the right and floated a cross to the back post, where Victor Wanyama headed it back across to Kane, who nodded in from two yards. Eight minutes later Son struck again, ridiculing Wilfred Ndidi at the edge of the box before sweeping a low shot into the net. The uprising had been quashed with imperious style.\n\nKane was not finished. He had his eyes on a personal prize as well as an emphatic team triumph. He rifled in a low 20-yard shot to complete his hat-trick, then fired in his fourth in time added on. That was the first four-goal haul of his career and he admitted he was driven by his pursuit of Lukaku at the top of the scoring charts.\n\n“I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t,” he said. “I was looking to take it into the last game, but now I’m in the driving seat. I’m not resting on my laurels, and I’ll go to Hull [on Sunday] looking to get four more hopefully."}, {"date": "17/05/2017", "arena": " Mary's Stadium", "attendance": 31425, "home_team": {"name": "Southampton", "lineup": [{"name": "Fraser Forster", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cédric Soares", "yellows": [37], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [69]}, {"name": "Jack Stephens", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Maya Yoshida", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matt Targett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Davis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Oriol Romeu", "yellows": [10], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Ward-Prowse", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [77]}, {"name": "Dusan Tadic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Manolo Gabbiadini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [6], "sub_off": [62]}, {"name": "Nathan Redmond", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Jordy Clasie", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jay Rodriguez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [62], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charlie Austin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Caceres", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sofiane Boufal", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [77], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jérémy Pied", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [69], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mouez Hassen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Manchester United", "lineup": [{"name": "Sergio Romero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eric Bailly", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Smalling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Jones", "yellows": [51], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matteo Darmian", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marouane Fellaini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [75]}, {"name": "Axel Tuanzebe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [64]}, {"name": "Juan Mata", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [69]}, {"name": "Henrikh Mkhitaryan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Anthony Martial", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wayne Rooney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Jesse Lingard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Carrick", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [64], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marcus Rashford", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [69], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ander Herrera", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [75], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Demetri Mitchell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Scott McTominay", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joel Pereira", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "If this really was an audition for Europa League final places, then Sergio Romero has confirmed his name on the Manchester United team sheet.

This was the Argentina international’s 17th appearance of the season in all competitions and his 11th clean sheet. He has been beaten only six times and, when he has featured, United have won 13 and drawn four.\n\nIt might sound strange for a manager to consider starting his No2 goalkeeper in a European final, particularly given De Gea’s status, and it will raise the inevitable questions about the Spaniard’s future at Old Trafford. Real Madrid continue to cast covetous glances but Mourinho explained his goalkeeping options were not normal and it was not difficult to see why he has such faith in Romero.\n\n“I don’t go with the ‘if he [De Gea] leaves’ because I hope he doesn’t leave,” Mourinho said. “We need two top goalkeepers and a top young goalkeeper [De Gea] and this is what we have. We have the Spain and Argentina national team goalkeepers and, for me, it’s amazing, especially because of their personal relationship. I never saw two goalkeepers to be so friendly. Everything has gone very smoothly during the season. Everyone was accepting my decisions.”\n\nIt said everything about United’s performance and ambition that the goalkeeper was by far their best player. It is now certain the club will finish with their lowest number of Premier League wins in a season but Mourinho was more concerned with avoiding injuries before the Ajax final. Worryingly for him, Marouane Fellaini came off with a hamstring problem, which the midfielder assured him was not a tear, while Juan Mata also took a knock.\n\n“Mata was just contact, no problem at all,” Mourinho said. “Marouane says that, from his experience, he doesn’t think it is a tear. So, trusting in him, he should be OK.”\n\nClaude Puel had needed a victory given the uncertainly surrounding the Southampton manager’s job prospects and he deserved one on the balance of play. But his team lacked cutting edge and their goal drought at St Mary’s goes on. For the first time in the club’s top-flight history, they have failed to score in four straight home games.\n\nPuel remains on thin ice and it has reached the point where it would be a surprise if he survived his end-of-season review. It had sounded ominous to hear Ralph Krueger, the chairman, refuse to offer him the slightest of assurances on Tuesday and, equally, it was not a good look when the home crowd jeered his late substitution of Ward-Prowse. There was a smattering of boos from them at full-time.\n\nPuel’s likely dismissal would look harsh if he finished in eighth position and when it is factored in that he took Southampton to only the sixth major cup final of their history. Even Mourinho admitted they did not deserve to lose the EFL Cup to his team. But the stodginess of Puel’s football has worked against him, even if this was not a bad performance.\n\nThe penalty was awarded in the fifth minute for a handball against Eric Bailly, even if it looked to have been outside the area, but Romero sprang low to tip away Gabbiadini’s kick. It was Southampton’s third penalty miss in five matches. The first half also featured Bailly working Fraser Forster after a storming run into the box and Anthony Martial dragging wide of the far post.\n\nSouthampton 0-0 Manchester United: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nSouthampton raised the tempo at the start of the second half and Romero distinguished himself further. Dusan Tadic’s free-kick exploded like a shell but Romero beat it away while, shortly afterwards, he did likewise with a low shot from Oriol Romeu, who had been teed up by Nathan Redmond’s cute cutback.\n\nSouthampton could lament a miscued volley by Jack Stephens at the far post, following a corner, while Romero made his best save to keep out Ward-Prowse’s curler from the edge of the area. His composure throughout was fortifying.\n\nUnited looked wobbly, their defensive efforts last-ditch but they flickered towards the end. Chris Smalling led a break up the right and, when he crossed, Wayne Rooney held it up before laying off to Mata, who sent his shot high. Martial went the closest for the visitors with a trademark curler for the far corner. It came back off the inside of the post.

It still has a pulse though. Wenger’s team continued their recent surge, digging deep to overcome obdurate opponents in Sunderland who, by the manager’s pre-match reckoning, ought to have been on the beach.\n\nThey were not and it took Arsenal until the closing stages to kill them off. Inevitably, it was Alexis Sánchez who inflicted the fatal cuts, the forward’s 22nd and 23rd goals of the Premier League season putting him one behind Everton’s Romelu Lukaku in the race for the Golden Boot.\n\nArsenal v Sunderland: Premier League – live! Read more\n\nMore importantly, when Everton visit the Emirates Stadium on Sunday – the final day of the league campaign – Arsenal will have hope. It is the faintest of hope but it is hope nonetheless. If Liverpool were to slip up at home to Middlesbrough or Manchester City were to lose badly at Watford, the door would be ajar for Wenger to prolong his run of never having failed to finish in the top four.\n\nWenger said after this game that he had spent the past 20 years arguing with fans who have been underwhelmed by mere top-four finishes. “I don’t know why, suddenly, it [coming in below fourth] could become such a big problem,” he said. His tone was rather facetious but there is no doubt that if he could produce another one, it would put a more positive spin on the campaign.\n\nPlay Video 1:03 Wenger: Arsenal have 'good chance' of top-four finish – video\n\nIt was an evening when a stand-out detail was the number of empty seats inside the Emirates. At kick-off, it did not seem overly generous to put the ground at two-thirds full and, in relation to the great debate over Wenger’s future beyond the end of the season, it felt as though fans had voted with their feet. It should be said that the ground did fill up – a bit.\n\nArsenal were nervy and disjointed, with Wenger saying his players had felt the strain of playing a fourth game in 10 days. They also ran into a goalkeeper in inspirational form. What a season it has been for Jordan Pickford and he further enhanced his reputation here. Arsenal mustered 36 shots on his goal and the statistics showed that he made 11 saves. He had no right to make some of them.\n\nSánchez, though, was relentless and he finally found the way through. He now has 28 goals in all competitions for the season and both of these were converted from close range, his poacher’s instincts to the fore. The first came after Mesut Özil had turned Granit Xhaka’s lovely ball over the top inside and the second followed Pickford’s save from Olivier Giroud’s volley. Sánchez had been a selection doubt because of a thigh injury and Wenger said he only named him in the team at four o’clock. He could be thankful that he was able to.\n\nIt was certainly a weird atmosphere until around the hour mark, more in keeping with a pre-season friendly and Sunderland had a couple of flickers on the counterattack in the first half, with Petr Cech denying first Didier Ndong and then Jermain Defoe.\n\nArsenal fired only in fits and starts and it said much that their first moment of excitement did not come until the 43rd minute, when Özil released Héctor Bellerín, who shot into the side-netting. On the stroke of half-time, Aaron Ramsey – who later limped off suffering from a dead calf – swapped passes with Özil and got in a volley that Pickford turned around the post. From the corner, Rob Holding failed to generate any power in a free header. Pickford had earlier saved smartly from Giroud.\n\nDe Bruyne drives Manchester City past West Brom to verge of Champions League Read more\n\nArsenal’s evening threatened to be summed up by a darkly comedic moment early in the second half, when Nacho Monreal threatened his own goal with an errant back-pass, and Cech found himself handling to concede a free-kick, which came to nothing.\n\nThe home team would eventually pick up the intensity, and so would the crowd. The trigger was arguably the double substitution that Wenger made in the 68th minute. Off came Ramsey and Kieran Gibbs; on went Danny Welbeck and Alex Iwobi and Wenger rejigged from his 3-4-2-1 formation to something closer to 4-2-3-1.\n\nWelbeck made a difference and he forced Pickford into a sprawling save with a shot from distance. Moments later, Sánchez made the breakthrough and the relief among the home supporters was palpable. Arsenal finished with a flurry and, as well as Sánchez’s second goal, there were chances for Xhaka and Iwobi, while Shkodran Mustafi hit the crossbar. In the end, the result was all that mattered.

"Manchester City know they have all but secured a place in the top four after a victory over West Bromwich Albion that means they can only be caught by Arsenal on Sunday by losing at Watford and also giving up a five-goal swing in goal difference.\n\nOn an emotional night marked by Pablo Zabaleta’s last home outing the victory, despite the fact that Arsenal also defeated Sunderland, means that if Pep Guardiola’s side can win at Vicarage Road they will definitely claim third position ahead of Liverpool or Arsenal in the manager’s first campaign, guaranteeing entry to the Champions League at the group stage.\n\nManchester City v West Brom: Premier League – live! Read more\n\n“We are third so it is in our hands to finish third,” said Guardiola. “We are going to play Watford and win the game. Of course, they [Arsenal] have to score five or six goals against Everton but now we will travel to London to win the game and finish third.” Only a defeat coupled with a sizeable Arsenal win over Everton on Sunday could send City down to fifth.\n\nGuardiola had made two changes to the side which had beaten Leicester on Saturday, dropping Gaël Clichy for Aleksandar Kolarov and Raheem Sterling for Sergio Agüero, each of these players among the night’s replacements. Tony Pulis made three changes as out went Gareth McAuley, James McClean and Sam Field, and in came Claudio Yacob, Marc Wilson and Nacer Chadli.\n\nOn 11 minutes came am chorus of “Stand up if you love Pablo”, and the Etihad rose to hail the departing full-back. Next the home fans appealed to Craig Pawson for a penalty after Leroy Sané went down as Allan Nyom challenged him but the referee was unmoved.\n\nGuardiola greeted a hopeful Kolarov punt with frustration as it was hardly the composed pass-and-move stuff he prefers. Yet the ball came to the outstanding Agüero who, after a slip, played in Sané. The German advanced along his left-hand channel then shot but missed, heightening Guardiola’s annoyance.\n\nCity took the lead via a slick move. Yaya Touré rolled the ball to Agüero, he flicked delightfully on to Kevin De Bruyne who played in Jesus and no mistake was made. The goal broke the contest open as City doubled their advantage 106 seconds later. Once again Agüero was involved as a link man, the ball passing through him before it eventually came to De Bruyne. The Belgian fired a rocket beyond Foster.\n\nIt was the kind of cut-throat quality Guardiola complains is missing from his side. So the manager will have been delighted, but also possibly disappointed that this was only De Bruyne’s sixth league strike.\n\nArsenal’s top-four hopes intact as Alexis Sánchez ends Sunderland’s resistance Read more\n\nVincent Kompany had limped for some of the opening half following a tackle so it was good news for City that he emerged for the second period. While a cheer as loud as those that followed each goal greeted Zabaleta’s trot along the touchline to warm up, Pulis waited only seven minutes to make a change, swapping Wilson for McClean.\n\nCity soon scored again, though, and it was simple. Touré played a one-two with Agüero, who dinked another superb pass on, and the Ivorian slotted past Foster.\n\nGuardiola was effusive regarding Agüero. “Gabriel was amazing but today the key player up front was Sergio. He didn’t scored but he helped us to play the third man, he made two or three assists. He made an amazing, amazing performance. Sergio played, wow, like a long time I didn’t see. He didn’t score today but he helped us to make an assists, he made the assist for Kevin and the second one and third double pass with Yaya.\n\n“ It was a good night and it’s in our hands to finish third, we go to London to win the game. It’s not done, fourth, but Arsenal have to win five or 6-0, but we are there, we will travel and try to put in a good performance and win.”\n\nAt 3-0 up the City fans could sing “we want Pablo”, and on the hour the fans got their wish. When Kompany was taken off Zabaleta was handed the armband in what was a classy touch. There was also a cuddle from David Silva and particular merriment when Zabaleta upended Salomón Róndon.\n\nHal Robson-Kanu added a late consolation for West Brom and Guardiola added: “Our performance was a resume of the year. We did well, created chances then conceded a goal and didn’t score as many as we deserved. Our home season was not good. We finished the last three games with a good performance. We dropped a lot of points.”\n\nWhen the final whistle came the send-off to Zabaleta began. For gifts the 32-year-old who was part of two title-winning sides was given a lifetime season ticket and shirt that read “Zabaleta 333”, to mark his number of City appearances.\n\nHe said: “This is probably the hardest moment in my City career for sure. It’s been a wonderful nine years. Sometimes you have to make tough decisions and always think of the best for myself for my family and the club especially, I feel I have done enough.\n\nIt’s the right time for me to move on.”"}, {"date": "15/05/2017", "arena": "Stamford Bridge", "attendance": 41473, "home_team": {"name": "Chelsea", "lineup": [{"name": "Asmir Begovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kurt Zouma", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Terry", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [22], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathan Aké", "yellows": [30], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "César Azpilicueta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [36], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "N'Golo Kanté", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathaniel Chalobah", "yellows": [58], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [79]}, {"name": "Robert Kenedy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [75]}, {"name": "Willian", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eden Hazard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michy Batshuayi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [49], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [84]}], "subs": [{"name": "Marcos Alonso", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cesc Fàbregas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [88], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [79], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pedro", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [84], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Diego Costa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gary Cahill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Temitayo Olufisayo Olaoluwa Aina", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [75], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eduardo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Watford", "lineup": [{"name": "Heurelho Gomes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adrian Mariappa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sebastian Prödl", "yellows": [83], "reds": [90], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "José Holebas", "yellows": [4], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nordin Amrabat", "yellows": [11], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Cleverley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Valon Behrami", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Abdoulaye Doucouré", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daryl Janmaat", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [51], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Etienne Capoue", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [24], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "M'Baye Niang", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [71]}], "subs": [{"name": "Troy Deeney", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Juan Camilo Zuniga", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Costel Pantilimon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Brandon Mason", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stefano Okaka", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [74], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [71], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andrew Eleftheriou", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dion Pereira", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "The homecoming of champions can rarely have been this thrilling.

John Terry may have scored his 67th goal for the club, his first in 485 days, to register for the 17th season in succession but he was understandably ring-rusty and bypassed at times by Watford’s sprightlier performers. He ended up hinting Sunday’s visit of Sunderland could mark his retirement. Kurt Zouma, too, struggled to show his true capabilities in a makeshift back line. Expecting either to hit the ground running was unrealistic.\n\nJohn Terry: I may retire from football after final game for Chelsea Read more\n\nBut plenty of others excelled to provide a gentle nudge in Conte’s ribs as he considers his selection for Wembley. Willian’s display might have been plucked from last season, so impressive was he in orchestrating much of the home side’s best moments. Cesc Fàbregas, too, looks invaluable and his late burst of form was capped by a winner two minutes from time, thudded down into the turf to scuttle beyond Heurelho Gomes and into the corner of the net just as Watford were contemplating a first point since mid-April. Costa and others could put their feet up in the dugout and his evening probably peaked at the interval when he ambled into the press room to peruse the catering facilities, pick at a sandwich and eventually make off with a satsuma. “If he’d had a piece of chocolate cake, I’d have been very angry,” said the head coach. “Next time I’ll tell him to bring me a piece as well so we can share.”\n\nConte described the frenetic nature of the contest as “funny” though his compatriot, Walter Mazzarri, watched much of it through his fingers almost in mock horror. His days at Vicarage Road appear numbered, with this a fifth successive defeat and an eighth in 11 games, in spite of his side’s comebacks and the reality they are safe from the drop. Chelsea, even with nine changes from their lineup at The Hawthorns, scythed through the visitors too easily before plundering from set pieces. Terry exploited the first. The captain was granted his first start here since mid-September and rose, with Zouma, to Willian’s corner only for the ball to rebound down messily into the goalmouth. While Watford dawdled, the 36-year-old spun inside the six-yard box to convert off a post.\n\nPerhaps he was still lingering in his celebrations when, 36 seconds later, Daryl Janmaat swung over an optimistic cross that Nathan Ake headed up and Terry, his radar awry, nodded up and obligingly towards Etienne Capoue. “If in doubt, get it out,” said Terry. “That’s what I should have done.” The Frenchman looped his own header over a stranded Asmir Begovic and the visitors, with their first real involvement of any note, were level. Terry’s Chelsea career, while glittering, has never been straightforward. That madcap minute rather summed it all up.\n\nChelsea can challenge Europe’s elite clubs, says Cesc Fàbregas Read more\n\nYet César Azpilicueta, drilling a low shot across Gomes from outside the area after Eden Hazard’s corner, would re-establish the lead before the break with Michy Batshuayi, on his first Premier League start, tapping into an unguarded net after benefiting from Ake’s smart control of Kenedy’s deflected shot. That Watford recovered from that point must have encouraged Mazzarri, who suggested afterwards that he is already planning for next season, with Janmaat’s fine run and finish – exploiting Zouma’s poor touch – and the substitute Stefano Okaka, capitalising on yet more uncertainty at the heart of the hosts’ defence to thump a shot beyond Begovic, drawing the visitors briefly level.\n\nTheir evening rather unravelled thereafter, with Sebastian Prödl dismissed for a pair of late challenges and Troy Deeney rebuking Okaka, enraged by Pedro’s foul, as players squared up around the officials in stoppage time. Not that Chelsea cared. They go into Sunday’s game with Sunderland, once the tickertape has been shovelled away, hoping to secure a 30th league win of the season and already planning for Arsenal on 27 May. “You don’t start planning for the FA Cup final on the Saturday,” added Conte. “You start to plan 10 days before.” He has choices to make but, regardless, his team look unstoppable."}, {"date": "14/05/2017", "arena":

City clear of trouble proved beyond even Marco Silva. The Portuguese had arguably performed a minor miracle in stretching his team’s top-flight aspirations into the penultimate weekend given the mess he had inherited, with players sold in January and a state of inertia gripping the boardroom. Yet, in succumbing emphatically here the worst was confirmed. While a wave of relief swept from south London to south Wales, there was only numbed disappointment back on Humberside. The Championship awaits.\n\nThis performance perhaps summed up the issues even Silva could not resolve. Their away record remains the worst in the division and never threatened to improve here. Hull hogged the ball and probed constantly as Crystal Palace, needing only to draw, sat deep and heaved to contain every cut and thrust. Yet there was no bite, no composure in the final third and no reward. Chasing the contest from 133 seconds in, and always vulnerable at set plays, they were eventually cut to shreds on the break. The final scoreline looked harsh but the feeling of demotion, and an opportunity missed by those on high, will be even more brutal.\n\nHull City relegated from Premier League after 4-0 defeat to Crystal Palace – as it happened Read more\n\nQuite what happens next at the club is anyone’s guess but keeping hold of Silva will be one of the hierarchy’s trickier tasks. His initial six-month contract expires next month and it remains to be seen if he takes up the 12-month option. Such has been the favourable impression he has made since taking up the reins mid-season that plenty covet his services. Southampton have been mentioned as potential suitors should they dispense with Claude Puel’s services – harsh as that would be – but Silva has only enhanced his reputation this year. He will be in demand.\n\nHe will meet the board this week, before the final-day visit of Tottenham Hotspur, and make clear his thoughts over the future – that of the club as well as his own – having publicly identified last summer’s chaos, which had briefly left them with 13 senior professionals going into a top-flight campaign, as the real reason this team have slipped back into the second tier. A defiant away support bellowed his name through most of the second half as his team desperately tried to erase a two-goal deficit. They would not be silenced even after shipping two more in the final exchanges. “They didn’t deserve what’s happened this season,” said Silva. “This is a sad day for this club.”\n\nBy the time the substitute Patrick van Aanholt was sliding in Palace’s fourth goal in stoppage time, the tension which had built here all season had long since been lanced. Palace, with a final-day trip to Old Trafford to come, had careered into this fixture patched up and fretting about their own future but those fears were eased by their early lead and eventually allayed altogether by their most emphatic home win of the season. It was no surprise that their three permanent January additions had combined to register the two late goals which thrust them up into mid-table. Jeffrey Schlupp was tripped by Michael Dawson five minutes from time, with Luka Milivojevic sliding in the penalty. Van Aanholt’s subsequent reward merely added gloss.\n\nPlay Video 1:06 Sam Allardyce reflects on seesaw season after keeping Crystal Palace up – video\n\nAllardyce pointed to the funding found by the owners in January as “critical in this major escape we’ve achieved”. “Because of the run-in, the size of the teams we had to play, this was the hardest yet,” said the veteran of acts of escapism from Bolton to Sunderland. “We’ve not wasted the magnificent results we achieved, winning at Chelsea and Liverpool, beating Arsenal 3-0. A sunny day, last home game, 4-0 … it’s a great end to the season.”\n\nSo much had appeared to hinge on early impetus, only for Hull to implode from the off. Andrea Ranocchia is an experienced centre-half who has 21 caps for Italy and has excelled at Internazionale, so the 29-year-old was the last member of the visitors’ back-line who might be expected to crack. Yet, a little over two minutes in, there he was swinging a right boot wildly, under no discernible pressure, at Dawson’s headed pass and managing only to air-kick. Wilfried Zaha, later announced as Palace’s player of the year for the second season in succession, burst forward at the Italian’s back to convert through Eldin Jakupovic and the game of catch-up had begun.\n\nThere were times when it vaguely threatened to yield a response but too often the possession ran aground on Palace’s massed ranks while Hull’s own vulnerability at the back was omnipresent. James Tomkins, who had barely kicked a ball for three weeks since sustaining an ankle injury at Anfield, might have converted Jason Puncheon’s corner but Christian Benteke eventually did, the forward permitted a free run into space to thump in a 15th league goal of the season.\n\nThe sloppiness of the concession rendered Hull’s cause hopeless. Their late capitulation reflected their gloom. Palace’s support ended up belting out their latest adopted chorus, Bob Marley’s “Three Little Birds”, reminding the world that “every little thing is gonna be all right”.

The equation is that simple for Jürgen Klopp and his players after an emphatic victory over an abject West Ham side ensured Liverpool remain in control of their own destiny going into the final day.\n\nA top-four finish is theirs to lose and it is hard to see Liverpool allowing that opportunity to slip through their fingers on the evidence of this performance, which was full of attacking intent. Philippe Coutinho was outstanding, scoring twice after setting up the first for Daniel Sturridge, who started in the Premier League for the first time since the beginning of the year, and Divock Origi completed the rout with Liverpool’s fourth.\n\nWe proved we can cope with pressure, says Liverpool’s Jürgen Klopp Read more\n\nThe visitors also hit the woodwork three times, registered 26 shots in total and dominated possession in an embarrassingly one-sided contest that rather summed up West Ham’s season. Origi’s goal was the cue for many of the home supporters to head for the exits with nearly quarter of an hour remaining and it was tempting to wonder what the ramifications of this result may be for Slaven Bilic, the West Ham manager.\n\nBilic was aggrieved that his side were not awarded a penalty before Liverpool’s third goal, when the West Ham manager felt Neil Swarbrick should have pointed to the spot after Georginio Wijnaldum caught Winston Reid in the face with a flailing arm, and he may well have had a case. Yet any perceived injustice in relation to that incident was no excuse for some of the abysmal defending at the other end of the pitch, where West Ham were a shambles at times.\n\nLiverpool were in the mood to take advantage and by the end the match had turned into an exercise in damage limitation for West Ham, whose players would probably have preferred to remain in the dressing room after the final whistle rather than return to the pitch to acknowledge the small number of supporters who had stayed behind to show their appreciation at the end of the last home match of a hugely disappointing campaign.\n\nThe scene will be very different at Anfield next Sunday if Liverpool can see off Middlesbrough and secure their place in Europe’s premier club competition. Although it has not been much a fortress for Liverpool of late, with their past three home matches failing to yield a victory, it is hard to see any other outcome than a win against a Middlesbrough side already condemned to the Championship.\n\nWith Roberto Firmino injured and Arsenal’s 4-1 win over Stoke 24 hours earlier leaving Liverpool with no margin for error, Klopp decided to change the system against West Ham and the Liverpool manager admitted his players took a while to be comfortable with what was essentially a midfield diamond. Indeed they could have been punished in the early stages when Sam Byram, unmarked on the right, dragged a low shot wide of the far post.\n\nThe Dozen: the weekend’s best Premier League photos Read more\n\nThe biggest scare for Liverpool, however, was just before half-time, when André Ayew filed a contender for miss of the season. Three yards out and with the goal at his mercy, Ayew somehow contrived to hit a post. Incredibly he did the same thing with the rebound. “Absolutely one of the biggest chances I ever saw in my life,” Klopp said.\n\nLiverpool were already ahead at that point and yet again it was down to the brilliance of Coutinho. Nathaniel Clyne, breaking on the right, seemed the obvious option when Coutinho assumed possession infield but the Brazilian spotted Sturridge’s intelligent run through the middle. His through-ball was weighted to perfection and allowed Sturridge, played onside by Byram, to scamper clear before skipping round Adrián, the West Ham goalkeeper, and rolling his shot into the unguarded net. It was Sturridge’s first goal for Liverpool since his last Premier League start, against Sunderland on 2 January.\n\nOn that occasion Liverpool dropped two costly points but there was no chance of the same thing happening here. They started the second half with greater intensity, forcing Adrián into three saves in a couple of minutes, and in that sense it was no surprise when Coutinho scored Liverpool’s second shortly before the hour mark.\n\nWijnaldum’s 25-yard volley rattled the crossbar – Joël Matip had suffered the same misfortune in the first half with a downward header – and West Ham were unable to clear the danger. Coutinho, loitering about 25 yards from goal, took the ball forward before drilling a right-footed shot into the corner.\n\nFour minutes later the game was in effect over as a contest when Coutinho got his second. With Reid lying on the floor after his clash with Wijnaldum Liverpool broke away. Coutinho, picking up the ball inside his own half, exchanged a few passes and continued his run. When he got the ball back in the West Ham area there was only going to be one outcome as he danced round James Collins’s half-hearted attempt to stop him before thrashing home from 10 yards. Origi, who had earlier hit the woodwork, capitalised on more woeful West Ham defending to slide in the fourth from six yards."}, {"date": "14/05/2017", "arena": "White Hart Lane", "attendance": 31848,

bar that one small, annoying detail about Chelsea’s position squatting defiantly at the top of the Premier League. The title is gone now and the same will soon apply to White Hart Lane – 1899 to 2017 – but it was some way to go and one final happy memory from the stadium that gave us The Game Is About Glory.\n\nUnfortunately for Spurs, it did not turn out to be the glory they wanted after that long, hard chase when Mauricio Pochettino’s team were threatening at one stage to catch and overhaul Chelsea. This is, however, their first second-place finish – and the only time they have gone an entire season without losing at home – since Bill Nicholson was manager in the 1960s. A small thing, perhaps, but the people who cherish this old stadium should embrace the fact it has reached its endgame with the best statistics of any ground in the country.\n\nTottenham Hotspur v Manchester United: Premier League – live! Read more\n\nThat, of course, told only part of the story on a day when the acoustics inside White Hart Lane have rarely sounded so good and, thankfully, the Spurs fans who cavorted on the pitch after the final whistle were eventually persuaded to make their way back to the stands.\n\nThe volume was turned high as the crowd fluttered their flags and serenaded their former heroes and it would all have felt terribly out of place if the current side had not risen to the occasion. Pochettino’s team ensured there was no sense of anticlimax. Yes, it was a melancholic day for the supporters who have headed down Seven Sisters Road all those years but, hell, those people made some noise turning it into a celebration. Spurs are on their way to Wembley, as the old song goes, and when Chas and Dave made a guest appearance at half‑time they did make the point that the new stadium will actually be closer, geographically, to White Hart Lane when it opens for business in August 2018.\n\nMore than anything, it was a victory that felt fitting for this kind of goodbye. Spurs inflicted the damage with early goals in each half, courtesy of Victor Wanyama and Harry Kane, and came through an awkward period after Wayne Rooney’s goal had given Manchester United 20 minutes to save themselves. In a different era, the team from Old Trafford came back from 3-0 down here to win 5-3 and create their own piece of White Hart Lane history. Sixteen years on, the modern-day United do not have the same precious magic. This scoreline flattered José Mourinho’s side and, barring an almost implausible set of results in the final week, United will have finished outside the top four for the third time in four seasons.\n\nUnited have not trailed Manchester City for four years running since the early 1970s. Mourinho’s talk of going for the title feels a faint memory when they are 22 points off the top and it almost came as a shock when Rooney turned in Anthony Martial’s pass to change the complexion of the second half. United had failed to score in all their previous away fixtures against teams in the top six. It was the same when they played at Chelsea in the FA Cup and, for a club with United’s ambitions, it is little consolation that Rooney’s goal made it a nervous finale for the home crowd.\n\nPlay Video 1:30 José Mourinho defends rotation policy after Tottenham defeat – video\n\nBy the time Rooney prodded the ball past Hugo Lloris – quite possibly, the last goal he will ever score in United’s colours – Mourinho had decided to abandon his tactic of using Axel Tuanzebe in a man‑marking role on Christian Eriksen. Tuanzebe chased his man all over the pitch before being substituted on the hour but the problem for the 20-year-old, starting only his second top-division fixture, was he could not stop Eriksen taking corners and free-kicks.\n\nAfter five minutes, Eriksen had the chance to swing over a corner from the left. He played it short to Ben Davies and United’s marking was generous, to say the least, when the Spurs left-back clipped his cross into the middle. Wanyama was unchallenged in the space between Rooney and Phil Jones and directed his header beyond David de Gea.\n\nGoodbye White Hart Lane: an iconic stadium remembered by those who knew it best Read more\n\nEriksen was also involved when Spurs doubled their lead three minutes into the second half, this time whipping a free-kick into the six-yard area at just the height and speed that goalkeepers dread. Eric Dier could not reach the cross but as the ball came down Kane jutted out his right boot. Chris Smalling was slow to react and De Gea was beaten for a second time.\n\nBy that stage Spurs would have been in a far more comfortable position but for De Gea’s goalkeeping and a collection of first-half saves when it quickly became clear that Jones and Smalling were having one of their sporadic off-days. Kane struck the crossbar with a close‑range header and for long spells there was the clear suspicion that United might simply be going through the motions, with the Europa League final uppermost in Mourinho’s thoughts.\n\nThey did at least threaten a comeback once Anthony Martial had beaten Kieran Trippier to set up Rooney’s goal – a poor moment for the Spurs right-back on a day when he kept Kyle Walker out of the team – and when the electronic board flashed up five minutes of stoppage-time the substitute Marcus Rashford might have added one late twist, but he was let down by a poor finish. An equaliser would have been unwarranted and game 2,533 at White Hart Lane had its happy ending."}, {"date": "13/05/2017", "arena": "Etihad Stadium", "attendance": 54407, "home_team": {"name":

hung on desperately for a scrappy win.\n\nAs is often the case with this Pep Guardiola side, they coasted then lost their thread and have a Riyad Mahrez slip to thank for taking all three points and moving into third place.\n\nPablo Zabaleta to leave Manchester City in the summer Read more\n\nMahrez was brought down by Gaël Clichy for a 77th-minute penalty but slipped over while addressing the ball, kicking it on to his standing leg and technically taking two touches in the process. Robert Madley, the referee, correctly ruled out the finish past Willy Caballero, giving the home team a free-kick. “It is not normal to see it but it is what it is,” said Guardiola.\n\nCity need four points to guarantee a Champions League spot and next play on Tuesday at home to West Bromwich Albion. “The second half we didn’t know whether to attack or defend,” Guardiola said. “You have to understand how important it is for the club, fans, the players [a top-four finish].”\n\nIn the first half Madley did award City a goal after David Silva’s shot went past Kasper Schmeichel as Raheem Sterling stuck out a leg. The forward may have made contact and been marginally offside, standing ahead of Christian Fuchs. Schmeichel led the complaints to the referee, who allowed Silva’s effort to stand.\n\nCraig Shakespeare, Leicester City’s manager, said: “Having seen the replay, I can see he is in an offside position.”\n\nThis was 29 minutes into the match and two more goals followed before the break. First City doubled their lead as Leroy Sané and Silva cut through the visitors’ defence before Yohan Benalouane scythed the young German down. Madley pointed to the spot and Gabriel Jesus converted.\n\nPlay Video 1:45 Pep Guardiola: \"The referee was so brave to interpret a good rule\" - video\n\nIt appeared the contest was over but Shakespeare’s side went in having pulled one back. Mahrez swept the ball left to Marc Albrighton, whose cross was volleyed beyond Caballero by Shinji Okazaki.\n\nGuardiola had made no changes from the 5-0 rout of Crystal Palace here in the previous Saturday’s early kick-off while Shakespeare swapped Andy King for Danny Drinkwater and Ben Chilwell for Robert Huth from the 3-0 win against Watford later that day.\n\nManchester City 2-1 Leicester City: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nGuardiola, for the first time naming an unchanged side in the league, had said Leicester would again hope to hit City on the counter, as they did when beating them in December. An illustration came when Schmeichel pinged a quick clearance to Jamie Vardy and Clichy was forced to foul or the centre-forward would have been clear on Caballero.\n\nAside from their goal and a missed header from Wilfred Ndidi, this was about it for Leicester until the interval. Instead City camped round the visitors’ area as Sané, Silva, Jesus and Sterling terrorised them.\n\nA Sané corner was mis-hit and came to Silva. The ball eventually returned to Sané and he skimmed in a cross that Chilwell scrambled away. Sterling took a ball from Yaya Touré, skinned Leicester’s defence and played in Clichy. The defender refused to use his right foot to shoot, found Sané instead and the ball was blasted over.\n\nThe lack of killer edge, which Guardiola constantly bemoans, was present again. How costly this might be was shown when Albrighton should have equalised in the second half from a Vardy pass. The winger mistimed the shot so City could breathe again, though they were now involved in a different contest from the one that had allowed them to go 2-0 up.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Gabriel Jesus celebrates scoring his penalty. Photograph: Alex Livesey/Getty Images\n\nTheir rhythm had been disrupted by a Leicester side who took up the fight and caused a concerned Guardiola to prowl the technical area. The Catalan’s stance is that more goals allow more comfortable defending and, when Sané motored down the left, a third goal seemed on the cards but there was no end product.\n\nNext Albrighton received a shiner after Fernandinho jabbed an upper arm into him. Despite the obvious evidence of the City midfielder’s offence Madley gave a drop-ball, much to Leicester’s chagrin. Of this Shakespeare said: “We have looked at the replay and there is no intent from Fernandinho.” Later Albrighton piled into the Brazilian to exact retribution, for which he was booked.\n\nBy the end City had held on through seven minutes of added time. But this is the latest evidence that Guardiola has work to do in the close season.\n\n• This article was amended on 15 May 2017 to remove the assertion that Manchester City are guaranteed a Champions

Boro’s return to the Championship was confirmed by Monday’s defeat at champions Chelsea and their final top-flight home match brought little relief.\n\nClaude Puel’s much-changed Southampton secured the win and the home faithful resorted to gallows humour to underline their anger at their side’s latest underwhelming display.\n\nThe Boro caretaker-manager, Steve Agnew, said: “I understand the frustration from the crowd, they’ve had a really, really disappointing season. We have to accept responsibility for where we are and understand the frustration from the supporters.\n\n“We’re disappointed with the result because we wanted a strong finish for our supporters more than anything.”\n\nBoro’s chairman, Steve Gibson, faces a big decision on whether to retain Agnew after failing to spark a late-season revival following the departure of Aitor Karanka in March.\n\nGibson spoke of a heartbreaking campaign and said of the managerial situation: “When we’re ready to announce that, I will.”\n\nKaranka’s name was chanted by Boro fans after the Southampton substitute Nathan Redmond scored a goal just as impressive as Jay Rodriguez’s first-half effort. The visitors’ second led things to unravel off the field, with the goalkeeping coach, Leo Percovich, gesticulating wildly in the technical area before Boro fans urged the referee, Anthony Taylor, to send off their own goalkeeper after Brad Guzan gave away a penalty. That plea was ignored and instead the home faithful cheered wildly as Shane Long blazed the spot-kick over. It was nothing more than a consolation goal in a match that underlined the issues faced at the Riverside Stadium.\n\nThe first half was without rhythm, excitement or clear-cut opportunities –little surprise given how little this match meant to either side. It took 23 minutes for Ryan Bertrand to get away the first noteworthy shot. In keeping with the start, it was poor.\n\nManchester City hold off Leicester after Riyad Mahrez double-hit penalty Read more\n\nFraser Forster comfortably dealt with a long-range effort from the Boro forward Bamford shortly afterwards, before George Friend headed wide.

Had David Moyes’s players not been quite so abject throughout this season, it would have been all too easy to surmise the virus had somehow spread to the city’s football team on what swiftly turned into an excellent afternoon for Swansea City.\n\nGoals from the impressive Fernando Llorente and Kyle Naughton offered Swansea a Premier League lifeline, leaving them on 38 points, level with Crystal Palace and, most importantly, four clear of 18th-placed Hull, who visit Selhurst Park on Sunday.\n\nJosh King’s late strike seals win for Bournemouth over Burnley Read more\n\nShould Hull stumble in south London, Swansea will be safe from relegation but even if Hull win, victory against West Bromwich Albion in South Wales next Sunday would be sufficient to ensure survival.\n\n“A big moment in our season,” said a visibly relieved Paul Clement, whose players will gather at Llorente’s house to watch Sunday’s game. “A really big win for us, a crucial three points. It wasn’t pretty but there was a really good shape about us. We’re on a great run of form and we managed to see the job out.\n\n“I was nervous but the adrenalin’s good – it keeps you focused, keeps you sharp.”\n\nEvidently in need of a major systems reboot, Sunderland are already consigned to the Championship. Whether Moyes will remain at the helm come August is unknown and the home fans made it abundantly clear they want him gone.\n\n“It was disappointing,” he said, adding that his future would be clarified after next weekend. “The fans have shown their disappointment at me and I know exactly how they feel. We’ve not performed well. We’re all embarrassed and disappointed.”\n\nSwansea’s recent revival – they have won three and drawn one of their past four games – has been largely inspired by Llorente and Gylfi Sigurdsson. Fittingly, that pair combined to propel them into an early lead. When Sigurdsson unleashed a deep free kick from wide on the right, the usually outstanding Jordan Pickford dashed off his line but missed the ball, leaving Llorente, who had successfully dodged John O’Shea, to head into an empty net.\n\n“A big mistake,” said Moyes. “I don’t know why Jordan had to come for that.”\n\nAcross in the technical area Clement pumped the air with a celebratory fist but the tension in his body language suggested his muscles were clenched as tightly as his fingers.\n\nAlmost immediately repeated chants of “We want David Moyes out,” and “Are you watching Ellis Short?” began reverberating around the ground.\n\nMaking a rare matchday visit, Sunderland’s owner was looking on from the directors’ box and cannot have enjoyed either what he was seeing or hearing inside an unusually sparsely populated stadium.\n\nAn early injury to Jason Denayer meant Darron Gibson, disliked almost as much as Moyes by sections of the crowd, came on to the pitch and was booed. Victor Anichebe received similar jeers when, shortly afterwards, the hamstrung striker hobbled off to be replaced by the infinitely more popular Wahbi Khazri.\n\nThe mutinous mood grew stronger once an increasingly fluent six-man passing move concluded with Swansea doubling their lead. A little earlier, Kyle Naughton had done well to prevent Anichebe meeting Fabio Borini’s dangerous cross but suddenly he was showing off his latent creative side. After collecting Ki Sung-yueng’s pass, the advancing full-back sent a glorious right-foot shot swerving across the helpless Pickford and arcing imperiously into the top corner. It was Naughton’s first goal since March 2011.\n\n“We want Moyes out” cascaded down from the stands once more. This time the choruses were louder than before and prefaced a bout of wholesale booing at half-time. By now no one envisaged Sunderland reprising last Saturday’s shock win at Hull, which did so much to boost Swansea’s hopes of staying up.\n\nNathan Redmond sees Southampton past Middlesbrough and closer to top 10 Read more\n\nShort cannot have failed to notice how many home fans had already departed by the time the second half kicked off. Those early leavers missed a home penalty appeal when Sebastian Larsson’s free-kick appeared to be blocked by Sigurdsson’s hand but, much to Larsson’s disgust, Andre Marriner disagreed, booking the Swede for protesting.\n\nBetween then and the final whistle little happened bar Khazri finally forcing Lukasz Fabianski into a save and later seeing his bad foul on Sigurdsson provoke a yellow card and mass bout of indignant push and shove.\n\nSunderland fans’ anger felt somewhat more intense and Moyes headed straight down the tunnel as calls for his head re-erupted at the end. Not surprisingly, Clement was minded to linger a little longer.\n\nAs Swansea’s manager strode across the pitch, saluting his players and the 3,000 travelling supporters, the sun suddenly burst through and started shining down on him."}, {"date": "13/05/2017", "arena": "Bet365 Stadium", "attendance": 27535, "home_team": {"name": "Stoke City", "lineup": [{"name": "Jack Butland", "yellows":

teams above them.\n\nThree straight wins is a decent response to the defeat by Tottenham and this latest takes them within a point of Liverpool with two games each left to play. Arsenal are beginning to play well again too, their second goal here was a thing of beauty, while Liverpool, in particular, appear to be succumbing to nerves in the final run-in. The matter is still in the hands of Jürgen Klopp and his players, though suffice to say anxiety is beginning to develop on Merseyside about Middlesbrough at home on the final day of the season, never mind Sunday’s game away at West Ham.\n\nStoke City 1-4 Arsenal: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nWhat this match proved, in addition to the fact that Arsène Wenger’s new formation is holding up, is that the experienced players forming the front three can still deliver. Olivier Giroud scored the first and last goals, Mesut Özil and Alexis Sánchez combined impressively for the second. On the basis of course and distance, it might be a mistake to write off Arsenal just yet. “We have 69 points now, let’s hope we can make it 72 on Tuesday night then we will see,” Wenger said. “We have shown we can stick together and keep going, if the other teams are better they are better.”\n\nArsenal always looked the more threatening, with Sánchez looking particularly determined but Nacho Monreal ending up with the early opportunities. When a ball from Özil came through to him unmarked at the far post he miscontrolled and saw the chance go by, then when good work from Francis Coquelin allowed Héctor Bellerín to send a cross over from the right Monreal headed against an upright.,\n\nSánchez sent a low shot narrowly wide after a mistake by Glen Johnson conceded possession in a dangerous area, but the only actual save Jack Butland had to make before Arsenal took the lead was early on when he tipped a speculative header from Shkodran Mustafi over the bar following a corner.\n\nStoke were even more tepid, offering little in the way of width or penetration and looking to Xherdan Shaqiri for inspiration. There are worse plans, though on this occasion Shaqiri was unable to come up with anything more effective than the usual wheeze of cutting in from the wing and making space for a curling left foot shot, and Arsenal were alert to that danger.\n\nChelsea to make Antonio Conte highest-paid manager to ward off Inter Read more\n\nJust as the first half was threatening to peter out uneventfully Arsenal made the breakthrough with the move they had been attempting all afternoon. Coquelin held the ball in the centre before releasing Bellerin down the right, this time the pass allowing the wing-back to get in behind Erik Pieters, and from then on it was a relatively simple task to play the ball along the six yard line to find Giroud waiting for a tap-in.\n\nArsenal opened the second half with a stylish strike, Özil passing inside to Sánchez then gliding forward to meet a perfectly delivered return pass, one that neatly bisected Ryan Shawcross and Bruno Martins Indi to leave his teammate a straightforward finish.\n\nMark Hughes responded by sending on Peter Crouch and Saido Berahino, which as he later admitted he possibly should have done earlier, for the unsettling effect on the visitors was almost immediate. Mame Diouf missed a difficult chance when Marko Arnautovic put his cross slightly behind him, Martins Indi saw a header tipped over by Peter Cech, then finally Crouch ghosted in front of the goalkeeper to meet a better Arnautovic delivery and pull a goal back.\n\nArsenal protested furiously that Crouch had used his hand to divert the ball past Cech, and though both the initial surprise at the veteran’s agility and subsequent television replays suggested they had a point, Mike Dean was unmoved. He had not detected anything untoward, so Crouch and his telescopic reach got away with it. Rather mischievously, the Stoke sponsors nominated their goalscorer man of the match. Wenger, who had been arguing with the fourth official at the time, was unimpressed. “We scored four and kept a clean sheet,” he said. “I was suspicious of the goal from the start because I was surprised to see Crouch get to the ball from his position.”\n\nIt mattered little anyway. Before the home crowd could even begin to make enough noise to encourage a recovery, Arsenal had pushed their noses further in front, Sánchez advancing unchallenged into the area then placing a shot through Shawcross and beyond Butland. Arsenal’s best player was replaced by Aaron Ramsey shortly after that, and persistence from the substitute led to Giroud’s second 10 minutes from time.\n\nWhile it is true that of the two sides only Arsenal had anything to play for, even so there is no room for complacency in the north-west. The final scoreline did not flatter the victors, it was actually the least they deserved."}, {"date": "12/05/2017", "arena": "Goodison Park", "attendance": 38550, "home_team": {"name": "Everton",

requested decision on his future but with a match-winning display against Watford. Time will tell, and possibly quickly, whether it is Barkley’s parting gift to his boyhood club.\n\nThe England international scored his fifth Premier League goal of a turbulent campaign to prolong Walter Mazzarri’s torment on the road and deliver Everton’s 13th home win of the season, their tally of 43 points the highest at Goodison for 27 years. Overall it was an encouraging response to another spell under the spotlight from Barkley. Before the game his manager had repeated his ultimatum to the 23-year-old to give an answer on a new contract by the season’s end, making it clear it is a case of sign or be sold this summer, and Koeman was not exactly overflowing with niceties afterwards towards the match-winner.\n\nChelsea win Premier League title again as Michy Batshuayi sinks West Brom Read more\n\nAsked if he was pleased with Barkley’s goal and performance, the Everton manager replied: “The goal was good. In the first half we didn’t have aggression up front: not from Romelu [Lukaku] or Ross. Kevin [Mirallas] yes, Idrissa [Gueye] yes and Morgan [Schneiderlin] yes, but like most of the players Ross did much better in the second half and scored a great goal.”\n\nAsked if he had substituted Barkley in the 79th minute to allow Goodison to give its homegrown talent a warm ovation, as it did, Koeman replied: “No. I thought we needed more control in midfield.” And asked if he wants more from Barkley, the Dutch coach said: “If you have followed me throughout the season you will know my answer.” Hardly a warm embrace for the player who secured victory and sparked Everton’s brightest moments from the start.\n\nBarkley engineered the first chance of the game when he exchanged passes with Gueye on the edge of the Watford area and tested Heurelho Gomes with a low shot having weaved his way into space. The Watford goalkeeper also saved well from Phil Jagielka before Barkley’s delightful flick took two Watford players out of the game and sent Tom Davies driving at goal. Gomes pushed away the 18-year-old’s drive from 25 yards.\n\nMazzarri’s tall, powerful side and 3-5-2 formation proved obstinate opponents while carrying a constant threat of their own. But with Troy Deeney, Sebastian Prödl, Stefano Okaka and Adrian Mariappa all unable to find a clinical touch in front of Joel Robles’s goal, the Watford manager was left to rue a sixth consecutive away game without a goal. His team are not mathematically safe. “I don’t think about that,” the Italian bristled. “I am not happy with the referee and not at all happy with how we lost the game. It was totally undeserved. We created the chances but the ball would not go in. I am angry about that and angry because we keep losing players to injury.”\n\nWatford lost defender Christian Kabasele to a thigh problem while Koeman replaced Mason Holgate with Enner Valencia at the interval to inject more pace and movement into the Everton attack. “I was not happy,” said Koeman, showing his brusqueness is not confined to Barkley. The knock-on effect was Davies’s conversion into a makeshift right-back, a strange switch that was immediately tested when Daryl Janmaat broke free and crossed low for Deeney who was unable to convert. Everton capitalised almost immediately.\n\nThere were groans around Goodison initially when Barkley collected Jagielka’s clearance, spotted Valencia free on the right and elected not to pass. The boyhood Evertonian seemed determined to mark the occasion with a goal and ran on, Prödl backing off all the way, until sweeping a right-footed shot from 22 yards beyond Gomes."}, {"date":

he might actually run all the away from the touchline to join in the victory scrum. Chelsea’s manager made it half a dozen yards on to the pitch before checking back but he did not have to wait too long before he could be with his players and his first season in the Premier League was assured of a happy ending.\n\nChelsea demonstrate depth but must reinforce to take on Europe’s elite | Paul Wilson Read more\n\nFor Chelsea, it was the moment that confirmed their fifth title in the last 12 years and the only downside of a glorious night for the new champions was the fighting that broke out in the home stands after the substitute Michy Batshuayi had delivered the telling blow. Chelsea have played a lot better at times this season but there can be no doubt they have been the best team in the country.\n\nIt has never been a bad trait for a team at the top of the league to win without being at their best and Tottenham Hotspur know now that their last game at White Hart Lane – at least as we know it – when Manchester United head south on Sunday will be for nostalgia rather than trying to keep up the chase. Football is a cruel game sometimes. “Tottenham Hotspur, we’re laughing at you,” was the new addition to the Chelsea songbook.\n\nIt finished with Conte getting the bumps in front of the Chelsea fans who had packed into the Smethwick End hoping The Hawthorns might finally bring them some joy. Two of Chelsea’s recent managers, André Villas-Boas and Roberto Di Matteo, lost their jobs after jarring defeats at this ground. That, however, felt like a long time ago as the away end went through their victory songs, David Luiz showed off his samba and the triumphant players decided it was time to start throwing John Terry in the air. Even Frank Lampard joined in the celebrations at one stage, leaving the touchline and his television role to embrace some of his old team-mates.\n\nPlay Video 1:17 How the 2016-17 Premier League title was won by Chelsea – video\n\nUltimately, it will not matter that Chelsea put in a stodgy performance or that Pedro and Eden Hazard faded so badly they were substituted. Those were just minor details after that moment, 82 minutes in, when Chelsea pressed forward for the goal that would mean so much. César Azpilicueta provided the pass. Batshuayi prodded his shot past Ben Foster and those were the moments when all that pent-up emotion could be released. Leicester City’s time is over but the ribbons on the championship trophy will still be blue and Chelsea will look forward to being reunited with it when they play Sunderland at Stamford Bridge next weekend.\n\nIt took a while to conjure up the decisive goal but every team that finish in Chelsea’s position need a resilient streak. Chelsea came up against obdurate opponents and it was difficult to remember at times that West Brom have been in the worst form of any Premier League side since the beginning of April, taking only two points from seven games and having previously set an unwanted club record of failing to score five times in a row.\n\nThe oddity of Tony Pulis’s managerial career is that he is known for his motivational powers yet West Brom, like Stoke before them, have a habit of tailing off once they know they are safe. In total, Pulis has won only six out of 45 games after reaching 40 points. This was West Brom’s fourth 1-0 defeat in five games, although in fairness nobody could accuse them of playing without desire. Pulis’s team caused grievous damage to Tottenham’s title hopes with a draw at White Hart Lane last season and they looked determined to show they could influence this title race, too.\n\nChelsea’s Antonio Conte: ‘This is for my players, the title is a dream come true’ Read more\n\nThere were also times when Chelsea, perhaps in their desperation to make the breakthrough, looked unusually ragged at the back. Salomón Rondón and the substitute Nacer Chadli had chances to punish them in the second half and in those moments it was unusual to see Conte’s team so vulnerable to the counterattack.\n\nFor most of the night, however, Chelsea were on top without being able to find a way through a team that spent parts of the game with a defensive line of six players. Conte’s men began like a team in a hurry. Cesc Fàbregas showed again he is an elegant replacement for N’Golo Kanté. Hazard and Pedro flitted around dangerously while Victor Moses and Marcos Alonso demonstrated why they have become such important players.\n\nAt various times this season Chelsea have been depicted as a counterattacking team – defence-orientated, if you listen to José Mourinho – but they can actually adapt their game in many ways and this was one of the occasions when they tried to overwhelm their opponents. Their problem was finding the killer pass. Foster is a difficult goalkeeper to beat and, though it was quickly forgotten by the end, the shot from Hazard that went out for a throw-in midway through the second half might well have been his least distinguished moment of the season.\n\nPerhaps Chelsea had also allowed a bit of apprehension to creep in, too. Passes were rushed, shots snatched. For all their possession, the goal was really the only moment of the night when they created a clear opportunity inside the penalty area. But then the ball was at Batshuayi’s feet, Conte’s fists were raised and it was an explosion of joy behind the goal."}, {"date": "10/05/2017", "arena": " Mary's Stadium", "attendance": 31474, "home_team": {"name": "Southampton", "lineup": [{"name": "Fraser Forster", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cédric Soares", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Stephens", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Maya Yoshida", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Bertrand", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Davis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Oriol Romeu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Ward-Prowse", "yellows": [44], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [70]}, {"name": "Dusan Tadic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [80]}, {"name": "Nathan Redmond", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [70]}, {"name": "Manolo Gabbiadini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Shane Long", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [70], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jay Rodriguez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [80], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Caceres", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sofiane Boufal", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [70], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pierre-Emile Højbjerg", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jérémy Pied", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mouez Hassen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Arsenal", "lineup": [{"name": "Petr Cech", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rob Holding", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shkodran Mustafi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nacho Monreal", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [36]}, {"name": "Aaron Ramsey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Granit Xhaka", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kieran Gibbs", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mesut Özil", "yellows": [73], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [89]}, {"name": "Alexis Sánchez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [60], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Welbeck", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [80]}], "subs": [{"name": "Gabriel Paulista", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Olivier Giroud", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [83], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [80], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Ospina", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Theo Walcott", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex Iwobi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Hector Bellerin", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [36], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Francis Coquelin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [89], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Arsenal are not done with their pursuit of Champions League football just yet.

Both centre-halves had anticipated an instant shot but ended up bypassed by the speed of the shift in Sánchez’s body weight. The Japanese was prone on the turf as the forward, having created his own space, calmly placed his finish past Fraser Forster. “The goal he scored shows what he’s about: very good technique in a tight space,” said Wenger. “He has invention in his head.\n\n“He’s creative, not fazed by anything, and he surprised everyone in the stadium tonight with his goal. Everyone was expecting him to take a shot, but he’s very quick on the move. He scores important goals. He didn’t score tonight in a 5-0.” It was the kind of contribution which settles tight contests, and an intervention which established him as the first Arsenal player to score 20 league goals in a season since Robin van Persie back in 2012. In truth, it was merely the latest reminder of how key Sánchez has become to this club’s ambition. How this club must crave securing him to a new long-term deal.\n\nSouthampton, the brighter side up to that point, wilted in pursuit when suddenly confronted by opponents clinging to a lead. It did not come as much of a surprise when Sánchez, glancing up while in possession on the left flank, floated a fine pass to the far post where Aaron Ramsey nodded back and Olivier Giroud, only just introduced to the fray, headed down and in from close range. Arsenal had not won in a top-flight game in this stadium since Wenger’s team were en route to becoming Invincibles back in late 2003. The forwards’ plunder ensured their most daunting remaining fixture had been cleared, and the games with Stoke, Sunderland and Everton no longer feel quite as onerous. Four wins in five league matches since they were humiliated at Selhurst Park have injected momentum back into this team’s approach.\n\nThey were grateful, too, for the contribution of Petr Cech and his revamped backline. Shkodran Mustafi, the central pivot of the back three in the absence of Laurent Koscielny with calf trouble, summoned a notable block to check Dusan Tadic in his stride while the goalkeeper denied Nathan Redmond from 30 yards having earlier thwarted Manolo Gabbiadini. The Italian’s bright start to life in England has rather petered out of late, with a shot into the side-netting and a mistimed flick at the near-post extending his scoreless run to 396 minutes in the Premier League. He is starting to sport a trudge which hints at despair.\n\nThat frustration is shared by his manager, with Claude Puel muttering post-match about a lack of “a good clinical edge” in his team’s approach. “Every game is ‘interesting’, but just not enough,” he said. “All the games are the same, from the beginning of the season. We’ve had the same feeling: opportunities, chances, good play, but no clinical edge.”\n\nArsène Wenger begins the battle for power at Arsenal Read more\n\nThat benefited Arsenal here, for all that the visitors had lacked their own bite for an hour. There was a legginess to their tempo up to Sánchez’s opener, as if a campaign that has lurched too often into disappointment was anchoring energy levels.\n\nAlex Oxlade-Chamberlain felt his hamstring before the break and limped away, a worry for the last three games and FA Cup final, and the midfield was rather one-paced whenever Özil and Sánchez were not involved. At least Héctor Bellerín injected some zest, his burst to the byline in first-half stoppage time almost jolting his team-mates out of their malaise, even if Stephens did enough to suffocate Danny Welbeck’s header in the middle.\n\nLife became simpler after the break, when the visitors were more imposing to ensure Wenger’s aspirations to reach the Champions League for a 19th year in succession remain intact.\n\nHis team have hoisted themselves to fifth place, three points off Manchester City and four from Liverpool. Both Pep Guardiola and Jürgen Klopp will be uneasy to find the usual suspects hovering unnervingly on their shoulder.

For Chelsea, the mathematics are simple now and surely nobody can think those celebrations at the end, with Antonio Conte on the pitch to embrace each of his players, were premature. His side will be champions with one more win and they looked absolutely determined to play in that manner against a Middlesbrough team that quietly drops into the Championship, relegated after only one season back in the top division.\n\nIf everything goes according to plan, Chelsea can wrap things up when they play at West Bromwich Albion on Friday. Alternatively, it could possibly stretch to their next home game against Watford the following Monday – if, that is, Tottenham Hotspur can beat Manchester United the previous day. All that is certain, for now, is that Chelsea have a seven-point lead with three games to go and their supporters can probably be forgiven for going through their victory songs. “Tottenham Hotspur, it’s happened again,” was one late chorus from the Matthew Harding Stand.\n\nAntonio Conte calls for ‘one more small step’ after Chelsea beat Middlesbrough Read more\n\nThey can afford to gloat because the chances of Conte’s side unravelling from this position are somewhere between minimal and non-existent. They will be deserving champions and their latest victory was typical of the high-energy domination that has brought them to this happiness. Chelsea did not have a single period of the match when they lost control. They won with something to spare and, if anything, it was a surprise they did not treat themselves to even more goals.\n\nMiddlesbrough, meanwhile, looked what they are: a team that has drifted aimlessly towards relegation, with 26 goals from 36 games. This was the 17th time this season they have failed to score in the league. They have not won at Stamford Bridge since Jack Charlton was manager in 1975 and that 42-year run was never likely to be threatened bearing in mind they have not beaten a single side from the top half of the league all season. Middlesbrough’s solitary away win came at Sunderland in August and they were obliging opponents for a team with Chelsea’s haughty ambitions.\n\nChelsea 3-0 Middlesbrough: five things we learned at Stamford Bridge | Dominic Fifield Read more\n\nThe champions-elect certainly did not miss N’Golo Kanté, absent with a thigh injury on the day he was name the Football Writers’ Association Player of the Year to go with the award he has already received from the Professional Footballers’ Association. Cesc Fàbregas fitted seamlessly into midfield, passing the ball with wonderful elegance, setting up two of the goals and delivering a man-of-the-match performance. On this evidence, Kanté deserves the season’s individual honours if he has kept this man out of the side.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Marcos Alonso celebrates with teammates after scoring the second, which deflected in off Middlesbrough goalkeeper Brad Guzan. Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian\n\nIt was a night when Diego Costa, with the opening goal, scored for the 20th time in the league this season, equalling his best-ever total for Chelsea. Eden Hazard shimmered with menace. Marcos Alonso and Pedro skimmed shots against the crossbar and Chelsea now have 84 points, three more than Leicester managed when they won the league last year and, incredibly, 36 higher than the team from Stamford Bridge had managed at the corresponding stage last season. Even at 3-0, Conte was still stalking the touchline, screaming orders and reminding us that the Italians are masters of the hand gesture. His team have won 15 out of their 17 home league games and they have a manager who simply refuses to allow complacency to creep in.\n\nMore than anything, Chelsea looked as though they were enjoying themselves. They played like a side in a hurry and it was from their first meaningful attack, after barely 70 seconds, that Alonso’s shot ricocheted off Brad Guzan, the Middlesbrough goalkeeper, to flash against the woodwork. The tone had been set and from that moment it was near-unremitting pressure on the visitors’ goal.\n\nGuzan had a difficult night but, in fairness, he was not alone when it came to Steve Agnew’s players. Fábio da Silva, Middlesbrough’s Brazilian right-back, had let Alonso run past him for the second goal and the same defender was also partly to blame when Costa opened the scoring 11 minutes earlier. Fàbregas had clipped the ball into the penalty area and Fábio, stretching, inadvertently turned it into Costa’s path, leaving the striker with the chance to slide his shot through Guzan’s legs.\n\nHomegrown Ben Gibson sums up the pain of Middlesbrough’s relegation | Dominic Fifield Read more\n\nBy that stage Alonso had flashing a shot across the goalmouth with his second attempt of the first half. His next effort was also going wide but Guzan had come off his goal-line. The ball struck the inside of the goalkeeper’s leg and flew into the net.\n\nThe rest of the night for Middlesbrough was an exercise in damage limitation but it would be harsh to say they demonstrated why they had won only once in their previous 18 league games since Christmas. The truth is not many sides could cope when Chelsea are playing with this drive and motivation, when Fàbregas is passing the ball with such distinction and every single player in blue is playing at the point of maximum expression.\n\nThey began the second half exactly where they had left off: looking for more goals. There was only one more, however, and it arrived in the 65th minute. Fàbregas, again, played the decisive pass. Nemanja Matic controlled the ball on his chest, spun away from the nearest defender and lashed in a right-foot shot.

Only time – and rivals’ results – will determine whether the Liverpool manager was clutching at straws but judgment does not have to wait on his team’s pursuit of Champions League qualification. They are scrambling towards the line at Anfield.\n\nShould Liverpool secure a top-four finish, and they remain in control of that destiny, it will not be courtesy of Fortress Anfield, having taken two points from the last nine available on home soil. Southampton emerged unscathed from a confrontation with Klopp’s team for the fourth time this season and with a fourth clean sheet after Forster denied James Milner from the penalty spot. Liverpool were laboured in their passing – a failing their manager attributed to the condition of the pitch – their movement and their finishing. A dry pitch cannot be blamed for all three flaws.\n\n“Before the game I said we needed three more wins and so now I would say two would not be bad,” Klopp said. “It makes sense that we now concentrate on West Ham. We are still fighting and nobody has given up or anything like this. I spoke immediately to the boys after the game – I cannot and don’t want to take away the disappointment – but what I said is that we have one point more than before. The best manager I had and the most experienced said always at the end of the season the point will be really welcome. I believe this. Now we have to analyse this game. We will do it one more time and then speak about it and start the preparations for West Ham.”\n\nClaude Puel may have his problems at St Mary’s, where his team were booed off after last weekend’s goalless draw at home to Hull City, but he has had Liverpool’s number this season. The first half was a non-event with only the referee Robert Madley’s decision-making rousing the Anfield crowd as Liverpool, not for the first time this season, found Southampton a disciplined, organised and immovable obstacle.\n\nPuel’s team showed only limited intent as an attacking force and spent most of a sun-kissed afternoon on Merseyside sitting deep and absorbing pressure. They did so comfortably thanks in large measure to a central midfield trio of Steven Davis, Oriol Romeu and James Ward-Prowse. Southampton’s midfield core stuck diligently to the task of protecting their defence while tracking Liverpool’s runs from deep, and the home side lacked the ideas and movement to find a route through to Forster’s goal.\n\nWhen they did escape the trio’s shackles, and Roberto Firmino was the only forward able to do so before the introduction of Daniel Sturridge, Liverpool’s attempts on goal were straight at the Southampton goalkeeper. With even Philippe Coutinho’s touch deserting him on occasions, the contest was another fierce examination of Anfield’s patience.\n\nKlopp’s team were handed a glorious opportunity to end the stalemate and enhance their Champions League prospects midway through the second half by Jack Stephens. The Southampton defender has flourished in the absence of the injured Virgil van Dijk and was enjoying another assured display here when he conceded a needless penalty. Stephens beat Divock Origi in the air as they challenged in the area for a Lucas Leiva cross but, as they jostled for the second ball with Emre Can and Maya Yoshida in attendance, the defender nudged the ball clear with his elbow.\n\nMadley had no hesitation in pointing to the spot. Southampton argued long and hard over the decision with Forster doing his utmost to unsettle Milner as he prepared to take the kick. He succeeded. The converted left-back struck his penalty hard and low but the England international goalkeeper read his intentions perfectly and produced a fine save to his right. Milner’s first miss from eight penalties this season could not have arrived at a worse time for Liverpool.\n\n“The penalty is harsh,” argued Puel. “Jack turns and the ball falls on his arm but it was too harsh to concede a goal against this penalty. It was an important save. For me it was not a penalty. On the other side we could have had a sending off for [Simon] Mignolet when he touched the ball outside his box.”\n\nKlopp countered: “You saw what they did. I understand how you should handle a situation like this. On one side you people will say it is very smart because he missed and on the other people will say it is not sportsmanship. Whatever I say we always look like bad losers or whatever.”\n\nThe Liverpool manager went for broke straight after Milner’s miss, introducing Adam Lallana and Sturridge for Lucas and Origi respectively. The threat level increased marginally but Forster was equal to everything that came his way. One save from Coutinho was routine, so too a tame effort from Sturridge after the striker had created space for himself superbly inside the area, but in added time he made an excellent stop to tip over the substitute Marko Grujic’s header from a Milner cross.

It came after a bang to a nerve in the back of his lower leg at Tottenham Hotspur last Sunday, only 20 minutes in, and the Arsenal midfielder feared he would have to come off. He gritted his teeth and battled on but when he eventually succumbed in the 65th minute his team were 2-0 down and heading for a morale-shattering defeat.\n\nWhat a difference a week makes. Xhaka felt the same injury here and he was removed from the fray in the 76th minute. This time Arsenal were 2-0 up and coasting towards victory in a game they had to win.\n\nXhaka departed to a rousing ovation. He had made the difference, turning the afternoon in his team’s favour with a deflected pot-shot, and no one could say the break was not overdue for Xhaka, who has endured a difficult first season in England after his big-money move from Borussia Mönchengladbach, or his club.\n\nJosé Mourinho writes off Manchester United’s chances of top-four finish Read more\n\nThere had been little on when the Swiss picked up possession early in the second half, 25 yards out and with this contest rather meandering. And so he shot. The Manchester United midfielder Ander Herrera turned his back, the ball hit him there and it looped up. In what felt like slow-motion, it began its descent and David de Gea watched as it plopped under his crossbar.\n\nArsenal were up and running, their early nerves a distant memory, and when the former United striker Danny Welbeck rose to head home Alex Oxlade‑Chamberlain’s cross, after Anthony Martial had been robbed by Rob Holding, the die was cast. United had offered little in an attacking sense and, when they were asked to respond, it was no surprise they could not.\n\nAt the 16th time of asking Arsène Wenger could celebrate victory in a competitive match against a José Mourinho team. Arsenal will need a favour from elsewhere if they are to finish a difficult season in a Champions League position but at least they are still fighting.\n\nAs for United, this was the limpest of defeats and Mourinho’s post-match press conference, when he wrote off his team’s top-four chances and had a pop at Wenger for pressuring the fourth official, was much more entertaining than what his players served up on the pitch.\n\nJosé Mourinho misses a trick for top four push with self-inflicted shunt Read more\n\nYes, they had two clear first-half chances, which Martial and Wayne Rooney could not take; Rooney’s opportunity was presented to him by an errant Holding back-pass rather than any creativity on United’s part. Petr Cech stood tall on both occasions. But Mourinho’s post‑match performance should not be allowed to obscure his team’s failings.\n\nOpportunity had knocked loudly for them after Liverpool’s home draw against Southampton earlier in the day. Once again United had control of their destiny in terms of the fight for a Champions League finish via the league. They surrendered it and a single statistic continues to damn them. They have not scored a single goal away from home against a top-six club this season – and that includes the 1-0 FA Cup defeat against Chelsea.\n\nThey do retain a shot at next season’s Champions League via the Europa League, where they are 1-0 up against Celta Vigo after the first leg of the semi‑final. Win that competition, return to the Champions League and, with the EFL Cup in the bag, the season is a success. Yet it is plain Mourinho has much work to do and what was remarkable about this defeat which ended United’s 25-match unbeaten run in the league was how meek the manager was about it.\n\nUnited have been described as injury-ravaged but Mourinho was without only five players because of various ailments – Marcos Rojo, Luke Shaw, Ashley Young, Timothy Fosu-Mensah and Zlatan Ibrahimovic. A sixth, Marouane Fellaini, was suspended.\n\nMourinho’s starting lineup was strong despite the eight changes he made from the first leg in Vigo last Thursday, although he was worried about how Phil Jones and Juan Mata would cope with their first football since late March. The same went for Chris Smalling, who had returned from a similar lay-off as a late substitute against Vigo.\n\nMourinho, though, would labour the point about how fatigued his squad are, having played three times each week since the beginning of April and certainly there was precious little spark about them.\n\nArsenal 2-0 Manchester United: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nArsenal pressed on to the front foot, with United happy to attempt to counter-attack, and the home team had their chances in the first half. Aaron Ramsey drew a fine save out of De Gea from Alexis Sánchez’s through-ball; Welbeck was denied by a desperate Jones block following a corner; and Oxlade-Chamberlain tested De Gea with a deflected blast.\n\nMourinho had clashed with Wenger midway through the first half after the Arsenal manager complained to the fourth official about a tackle from Rooney on Oxlade-Chamberlain. The home crowd stirred but they truly crackled to life on the one-two punch from Xhaka and Welbeck. Rooney had a couple of efforts towards the end but United could have played on and on and not scored."}, {"date": "06/05/2017", "arena": "Etihad Stadium", "attendance": 54119, "home_team": {"name":

paid dividends against Crystal Palace, who have claimed some impressive scalps over the last month but were always on the back foot here. Given the number of times the home side’s fleet-footed front runners gave the visitors’ patched-up defence a chasing, the margin of victory could have been even more emphatic but otherwise City made light of the absence of Sergio Agüero with their biggest league win of the season to leave Palace looking elsewhere for confirmation of their safety.\n\nSam Allardyce enjoyed telling everyone how he tactically outsmarted Liverpool at Anfield a fortnight ago and, to his credit, he was just as willing to front up after a far less convincing performance resulted in his heaviest defeat with his present side. “City thrashed us and that was annoying because we gifted them all their chances,” the Palace manager said. “All five goals could have been avoided if we had defended properly and losing like that is unacceptable. We recovered from their first goal quite well, then fell into the same trap at the start of the second half. After that it was capitulation.”\n\nEven before the goals started to go in, it was never difficult to tell the teams apart. Allardyce went with four full-backs, count them, strung in a line across the back. Guardiola made his own statement of intent by utilising just the one. Gaël Clichy operated in his normal position on the left while City deployed Fernandinho at right-back, watched by Pablo Zabaleta, Bacary Sagna and Aleksandar Kolarov from the bench.\n\nThat interested trio of judges would have awarded a poor score for positional discipline when Fernandinho wandered into midfield in the fourth minute to allow Patrick van Aanholt and Wilfried Zaha to make huge inroads down the Palace left, though Guardiola’s attacking line-up had already proved its worth by that point as City were in the lead.\n\nPep Guardiola: Manchester City best in Premier League at creating chances Read more\n\nIt took David Silva just under two minutes to pierce the Palace defence, collecting a return pass from Raheem Sterling via a terrible headed clearance from Martin Kelly to score with a volley from close to the penalty spot. If Kelly should have dealt with Sterling’s attempted cross more effectively than merely turning the ball back into a danger area, that is one of the risks one takes when a full-back is asked to play centre-half. City were also taking a huge gamble in getting Fernandinho to look after Zaha but, when the Palace winger found enough space to set up a cross, Clichy was able to reach the ball before Christian Benteke.\n\nCity looked slick going forward, with Fernandinho bringing a save from Wayne Hennessey, Sterling seeing a shot cleared off the line and wasting an opportunity by trying to set up Gabriel Jesus when he might have been better going for goal himself, but every time Zaha got the ball he was able to ask questions of the home defence. Vincent Kompany accepted a booking with a shrug on the half-hour, blatantly blocking Zaha with an indication that he had been left with no choice. On the next occasion Zaha eluded Fernandinho it led to a cross from the right and Willy Caballero had to make a save from Benteke’s header.\n\nMany a manager might have made a change at the interval, though of course Guardiola did not and his boldness was rewarded within four minutes of the restart. When a half-cleared corner came back to Kevin De Bruyne, he tricked the Palace defence into expecting a cross before cutting the ball back to Kompany on the floor, and the captain responded by summoning power and accuracy in a first-time shot.\n\nManchester City 5-0 Crystal Palace: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nA fine Hennessey save was needed to keep out a well-struck free-kick from De Bruyne but Palace’s resistance did not last long after that. Leroy Sané missed a chance before Jesus set up De Bruyne for the third, the midfielder arriving to take the striker’s short pass in his stride and clip a low shot past the goalkeeper.\n\nZabaleta came on to take over at right-back for the last 22 minutes and was involved in the fourth goal, nodding Yaya Touré’s cross into Sterling’s path for the winger to apply a left-foot finish, then Nicolás Otamendi completed the scoring with a spectacular flying header from De Bruyne’s free-kick. Jesus had left the field by then, oddly goalless on a day when all around him seemed to be filling their boots, though City will be relieved to see the young Brazilian manage more than 80 minutes

first away win since January and handed Bournemouth the point that seals their top-flight status for another year.\n\nShawcross unwittingly deflected Josh King’s strike into his own net but Stoke were frustrated that the Bournemouth striker had not been flagged offside from Max Gradel’s header. The goal stood and the visitors were forced to settle for just their second point on the road since their 3-1 league win at Sunderland on 14 January.\n\nStoke ended their 10-hour away-goal drought in the first half thanks to Lys Mousset’s own goal and an ungainly finish from Mame Biram Diouf. Bournemouth hit back through Junior Stanislas before Shawcross’s own goal ensured the two midtable sides shared the spoils.\n\nBilly Jones strikes for Sunderland to dent Hull City’s survival hopes Read more\n\nWhen Stoke did finally score an away goal it was not courtesy of one of their players. Instead, the Bournemouth forward Mousset put through his own net, unwittingly placing a backwards header past his goalkeeper, Artur Boruc, following Marko Arnautovic’s corner.\n\nThe home side were unlucky to fall behind, especially after Adam Smith’s fine early effort concluded the best move of the first half, the full-back blasting against the post from 18 yards after a superb reverse flick from Stanislas.\n\nHarry Arter was also fortunate to escape a red card for a two-footed lunge on Joe Allen, that he made contact with the ball perhaps just enough to keep him on the field.\n\nArnautovic then underscored Stoke’s tribulations in front of goal by heading over from four yards when unmarked, having been picked out by Allen’s neat cross.\n\nSam Vokes double edges Burnley closer to safety against West Bromwich Albion Read more\n\nBournemouth seized on the reprieve, Stanislas sliding home after Smith’s low cutback and King’s canny step-over. But just as the Cherries could sight victory, up popped Diouf with a finish as ugly as it was welcome to the visitors.\n\nArnautovic unsettled Francis when challenging for Geoff Cameron’s cross, allowing Diouf to latch on to the loose ball for his first league goal in 12 months. The Senegal striker eventually hooked the ball home, but the way his finish bobbled in will have left Boruc kicking himself.\n\nThe game’s second own goal then had the hosts level again with Shawcross powerless to prevent himself deflecting King’s effort past Jack Butland. Smith again played a pivotal role, his cross allowing Gradel to head into King’s path despite the fact that the Norway striker appeared to have strayed offside.\n\n“Arter’s very lucky to stay on the field,” said Mark Hughes. “It was a poor challenge and should have been penalised with a red card. And Gradel did kick out [at Shawcross], so he’s fortunate that the fourth official didn’t see it.\n\n“[King] got fortunate with the offside, and his initial touch has taken it away from goal.

2017 and earned Burnley a draw that all but confirmed their Premier League survival.\n\nAfter a forgettable first half, Vokes’s 56th-minute opener ignited proceedings with the visitors scoring twice in 12 minutes through Salomón Rondón and Craig Dawson having previously gone nearly nine hours without a goal.\n\nA first victory on their travels since New Year’s Eve eluded West Brom as Vokes capitalised on Ben Foster’s poor decision to come out for a free-kick, the striker levelling with four minutes remaining to take Burnley to 40 points.\n\nInjuries to Ben Mee and Michael Keane meant that Burnley had to deploy an inexperienced centre-back pairing of James Tarkowski and Kevin Long, but the pair were scarcely tested in the opening half as the home team registered the only two opportunities of note.\n\nBilly Jones strikes for Sunderland to dent Hull City’s survival hopes Read more\n\nGeorge Boyd created the first with a left-wing cross that was met by a near-post Vokes volley that deflected off Gareth McAuley and was kept out by Foster’s leg.\n\nBoyd was involved in the move for the other chance as were Vokes and Ashley Barnes, the latter feeding Scott Arfield, who bore down on goal before seeing his shot stopped by James McClean’s terrific sliding intervention.\n\nBurnley had an even better opportunity early in the second period as the unmarked Tarkowski met Arfield’s corner only for his bullet header to clear the crossbar.\n\nTony Pulis withdrew Jonny Evans shortly after, possibly due to a first-half foot injury, and five minutes later Burnley went ahead.\n\nJake Livermore was hanging on to Barnes’s back as the two entered the box and tumbled down and the assistant flagged for a penalty. Mike Jones, the referee, allowed play to continue and Barnes had the foresight to cross for Vokes to sweep a first-time finish beyond Foster.\n\nThe official deserved credit for hanging fire when it came to the awarding of any decision while Barnes’s vision to get off the turf and swing a cross in was also admirable.\n\nCenturion Riyad Mahrez shines in comfortable Leicester win over Watford Read more\n\nThe visiting side had offered little attacking threat as they edged towards the nine-hour mark without a goal, but all that changed 10 minutes after Vokes’s opener as Dawson reached Chris Brunt’s corner and the ball looped on to the crossbar.\n\nWest Brom eventually reworked the ball out to the left flank where Matt Lowton was caught out by McClean and neither Long nor Tarkowski could prevent his cross reaching Rondón, who fired in his first goal since December.\n\nTarkowski tried to redeem himself with a stinging volley that he fired into Marc Wilson’s arm but he was caught out 12 minutes from time.\n\nThe visitors earned a corner when Livermore’s effort was deflected over and from Brunt’s delivery, Dawson lost Tarkowski, heading against Barnes’s chest, with the ball then going in off the post for West Brom’s 15th set-piece goal of the season.\n\nIt was another dead-ball situation that helped Burnley claim a share of the spoils. Foster rushed out to try and collect substitute Robbie Brady’s chipped free-kick but was unable to reach it before Vokes, who flicked a header past him to make it 2-2.\n\nAsked about the scale of Burnley’s achievement in staying up, Sean Dyche said: “It’s very difficult at the top level of football without major finance. It’s more about wages. There are teams who get players on frees who are paying astronomical wages.\n\n“We are good on both and that’s because we have to be. It’s the way this club has to work.

Sunderland’s manager gave a bland answer, yet the flintiness in his eyes suggested he was inwardly seething and particularly keen to end his east Yorkshire counterpart’s proud record of having not lost a home league game in Portugal, Greece and England since March 2014.\n\nThanks to an amalgam of Jordan Pickford’s heroics in goal and Hull’s failure to cope with the pressure of suddenly being expected to be the team in control, Moyes not only shattered Silva’s record but significantly increased the prospect of Hull joining Sunderland down in the Championship next season.\n\nWith awkward fixtures at Crystal Palace and at home to Tottenham Hotspur ahead, hope is suddenly an unexpectedly dwindling resource by the Humber, especially after Swansea’s win against Everton.\n\n“Losing today is not good for us,” said Silva, who thought Hull merited at least one penalty. “I knew beforehand it wasn’t an easy game and Sunderland came here to prove something. I believe if we’d scored first we would have won but we didn’t play well. Our team played with big tension behind us. It’s not a good moment for us but it’s a moment to be calm. Today we weren’t calm, we tried to do everything too fast. If you don’t play calm, it’s impossible to play well.”\n\nDavid Moyes, whose Wearside future remains uncertain, was somewhat brighter-eyed: “I definitely wish this had happened a few weeks ago but we’ve been playing well and the win was coming,” he said. “The players showed pride in their performance.”\n\nFernando Llorente strikes against Everton to get Swansea out of drop zone Read more\n\nGeorge Honeyman should really have given Sunderland an early lead but the young midfielder – decent throughout – headed wide after connecting with Billy Jones’s inviting cross after Jermain Defoe’s decoy run had distracted Hull’s defence.\n\nCheered on by their convalescent midfielder Ryan Mason – back at the KCom for the first time since fracturing his skull at Chelsea in January – Silva’s side made an ominously shaky start.\n\nAccustomed to sitting back at home before hurting visitors on the counter-attack, they were now supposed to be dominant but did not seem to have entirely got the hang of it. Almost imperceptibly such uncertainty spread to an initially noisy home crowd, prompting chants of “Is this a library?” from Sunderland’s large, vocal and surprisingly cheerful, travelling support.\n\nNot for the first time this season Sam Clucas did more than any other Hull player, bar the menacing Kamil Grosicki, to recalibrate the mood. Invariably integral to his team’s better manoeuvres, Clucas proved the conduit through with much of their play flowed. Fittingly his low volley stretched Pickford to the absolute limit in the wake of Grosicki’s sashay past Billy Jones and clever cross.\n\nWith Harry Maguire subsequently shooting inches wide and Pablo Hernández changing pace before surging beyond Javier Manquillo and bending a left-foot shot past the far post, Silva’s side improved but never looked exactly secure at the back.\n\nClucas needed to watch his step after collecting a booking for fouling Didier Ndong but he retained sufficient cool to whisk the ball off Defoe’s toecaps as the England striker threatened to end his recent goal drought.\n\nEldin Jakupovic, whose late penalty save the previous weekend earned Hull the point at Southampton that sent Sunderland down, did similarly well to repel Defoe’s shot at the end of a rapid Sunderland break while Pickford’s intervention just prevented Alfred N’Diaye heading Grosicki’s cross beyond him.\n\nPickford’s wonderful reflexes and brilliant footwork are coveted by a host of leading clubs and he emphasised his ability with a fabulous fingertip save which somehow steered Lazar Markovic’s header to safety after the Liverpool loanee met Ahmed Elmohamady’s pinpoint cross. “If Jordan leaves us this summer, it will be for a big price,” said Moyes. “A really, really big price.”\n\nAs John O’Shea’s sliding interception forced Hernández into shooting wide, Hull fans grew despondent. The previously real prospect of a bright Premier League future was dimming with every passing minute with the lights very nearly going out completely when Jones stunned both sets of supporters by giving Sunderland the lead. Demonstrating he remains useful at both ends, O’Shea flicked on Honeyman’s corner, enabling Jones to power a diving, six-yard header in off a post.\n\nIf Grosicki’s uncomfortable relocation from left to right following an injury to Markovic suited Sunderland, Moyes still required Pickford to preserve his side’s lead. A particularly outstanding one-handed save to deny Hernández probably pushed his value up at least a couple of million.\n\nBy now alternately disconsolate and frantic, Silva replaced a midfielder with a striker, swapping N’Diaye with Dieumerci Mbokani but, for once, his customary boldness rebounded as Defoe scored a late, arguably offside, close-range, second for Sunderland.\n\n“My home record isn’t important,” said Hull’s manager. “But the result is.”"}, {"date": "06/05/2017", "arena": "The King Power Stadium", "attendance": 31628, "home_team": {"name": "Leicester City", "lineup":

Twelve months after the 5,000-1 shots were crowned Premier League champions here, goals from Wilfred Ndidi, Riyad Mahrez and Marc Albrighton secured a victory for Leicester that moved them into the top half of the table for the first time since September.\n\nIt meant Craig Shakespeare has now recorded five successive home victories since replacing Claudio Ranieri in February – the first Leicester manager to achieve that feat in the top flight since Gordon Milne in 1984.\n\nThat statistic, coupled with the fact they are now on course to finish higher than Chelsea could manage in their title defence last year, should go a long way to ensuring the former assistant is handed the post on a permanent basis.\n\n“The whole club can be very pleased that we have been able to secure Premier League survival,” said Shakespeare. “Now we have three games left and I want to try and finish on a high.”\n\nIn a week when Leicester’s players said goodbye to the trophy they won last year at an impromptu ceremony in the training ground canteen, it remains to be seen how many of the players who contributed to such a memorable achievement will be here with him come August.\n\nDemarai Gray’s plea for more opportunities when the 20-year-old has been restricted to nine league starts this season appeared to have fallen on deaf ears as Shakespeare named his tried and trusted starting XI once again for this dead rubber.\n\nDavid Silva kickstarts Manchester City’s rout of Crystal Palace Read more\n\nMahrez became the first Algerian to make 100 appearances in the Premier League, although last season’s PFA player of the year is also believed to be having itchy feet now the fairytale story of the past two seasons is finally at an end.\n\nReports have suggested that Barcelona have been keeping tabs on his progress, but aside from the odd flicker Mahrez has rarely risen to the exalted heights of the 2015-16 title-winning campaign.\n\nOn the strength of those performances, his agents negotiated a new contract last summer containing an agreement that will allow him to leave the club if a suitable offer – understood to be around £40m – is received.\n\nThat price tag could prove to put off the majority of suitors but Mahrez appeared intent on showing why he may be worth the risk with a performance that was oozing with skill and was capped by his 10th goal of the season in all competitions.\n\nWatford, who have now lost five successive away matches without scoring since their win at Arsenal in January, left their captain, Troy Deeney, on the bench in favour of Stefano Okaka.\n\nWalter Mazzarri has promised to take an intensive course in English at the end of the season despite having spent the best part of two years in the country before his arrival at Vicarage Road. The chances of him becoming the first Watford manager to survive the summer since Gianfranco Zola in 2013 seem low, even if his side did come close to finding a way back into the game after Étienne Capoue had gifted Ndidi the opening goal in the first half.\n\n“The result didn’t really reflect how the game went,” said Mazzarri, via an interpreter. “We committed two individual mistakes for the goals but our performance for much of the game was the same as Leicester.”\n\nMahrez left the field to a standing ovation when he was replaced by Gray, but the best moment was reserved for the second minute of stoppage time.\n\nJamie Vardy, who has shown his quality in the past few weeks as Leicester have pulled away from the bottom three, broke down the left and timed his pass to perfection for Albrighton to fire home via the post.\n\n“It was a year ago so it was good to put it behind us,” said Shakespeare. “We have to move on from that now. I don’t think you can take anything for granted in football. I have an assistant manager’s contract after the end of the season so I have to make sure I do everything accordingly and professionally.”\n\nHe and his superiors will just hope they can persuade Mahrez, Vardy and some of Leicester’s other heroes that the grass is not always greener on the other side.\n\n… Leicester celebrated becoming the unlikeliest champions in the Premier League years, possibly in football history. After Spurs’ slip at Chelsea the previous Monday conceded the title while the Leicester players watched at Jamie Vardy’s house, the striker starred in an on‑pitch party scoring twice in a 3-1 win against Everton. The hangover lasted a long time and Claudio Ranieri ultimately lost his job, but the memories will last a lot longer."}, {"date": "06/05/2017", "arena": "The Liberty Stadium", "attendance": 20827,

the chain of events that has taken them out of the relegation zone with two matches remaining. Hull City’s surprise defeat at home against Sunderland opened a window of opportunity that Swansea took full advantage of with the most precious of victories, courtesy of yet another Fernando Llorente header.\n\nIt was Llorente’s 13th goal of the season and enough to lift Swansea one point ahead of Hull, who have now slipped into the bottom three, prompting huge celebrations among the home supporters here at the final whistle. With Hull travelling to Crystal Palace next Sunday, Swansea now have a chance to crank up the pressure on both of those clubs by picking up another three points at Sunderland the day before.\n\nThe most positive thought for Paul Clement and his players right now is that they are in control of their own destiny – a scenario that seemed unthinkable at the start of the day, with many people wondering how Swansea would respond when Hull opened up a five-point gap by beating already-relegated Sunderland.\n\nThe news that Hull had lost was greeted with jubilation by the home supporters beforehand and fuelled the raucous atmosphere inside the Liberty Stadium, helping to carry Swansea to victory. It was tense for long periods but especially in the closing stages, when Clement admitted his mind drifted back to that chastening defeat against Tottenham Hotspur, when Swansea conceded three late goals. On this occasion, however, his players refused to buckle.\n\nAlfie Mawson was outstanding in central defence alongside the excellent Federico Fernández. The evergreen Leon Britton produced another influential performance at the base of the Swansea midfield and Jordan Ayew never stopped running up front. Yet it was Llorente who produced the game’s defining moment with his seventh headed goal of the season – more than any other Premier League player.\n\nRonald Koeman was left to rue that passage of play on another disappointing away day for Everton. They have failed to win in any of their last seven matches on the road and the lack of conviction in their attacking play must be a source of concern for the Everton manager.\n\nEverton have failed to score in their last three matches and registered only five attempts on goal during that run. In fact it is hard to escape the feeling that, with little to play for between now and the end of the season, his players’ minds have already drifted to the summer.\n\n“We know what we need to improve,” said Koeman. “Most of the things in the team are really good, [such as] the defending and organisation, but the difference between scoring goals at home and away from home is too big.”\n\nKoeman tried to change things against Swansea by starting with Ross Barkley on the bench but Everton looked flat in the first half. Barkley was introduced at the restart and, although Everton had much more possession in the second half, the visitors created little of note.\n\nSwansea actually looked more likely to score again. Ayew struck the outside of the post with a volley, Mawson’s header was blocked by Barkley – the Everton midfielder knew little about it – and Leroy Fer was desperately unlucky not to score when he met Tom Carroll’s fine cross with a first-time shot that Maarten Stekelenburg saved at point-blank range.\n\nLlorente had not been so forgiving in the 29th minute. Ayew was the architect, the forward twisting and turning close to the byline to get away from Gareth Barry before delivering an inch-perfect cross that implored Llorente to nod home. Towering above Phil Jagielka, the Spaniard squeezed his header past Maarten Stekelenburg and the stadium erupted.\n\nBelief coursed through Swansea for a period as they began to attack with more purpose. Everton looked a little disjointed and Swansea should have added a second four minutes later. Gylfi Sigurdsson, who had a penalty appeal turned down moments before Llorente’s breakthrough goal, delivered a cross from wide on the right that evaded a clutch of players and ran through to Mawson, on the edge of the six-yard box. Mawson seemed certain to score but Mason Holgate, Everton’s right-back, got across to make a superb block.\n\nIt was Swansea’s turn to throw bodies in front of the ball in the second half, prompting Clement to praise his players for a “magnificent collective effort defensively to get the right result”.

as lustily by Chelsea fans as it was by the West Ham faithful.\n\nMauricio Pochettino’s men arrived on a nine-game winning streak and a mission to slash Chelsea’s lead at the top of the table to a single point but they performed sluggishly and left with nothing but regrets. Chelsea will be champions if they beat Middlesbrough on Monday and West Bromwich Albion on Friday. For the second season in a row Spurs have tripped up just as they gained momentum that spawned hopes of glory. They fly so high, nearly reach the sky, then like their dreams, they fade and ... well, West Ham fans know the rest, and so do Spurs, forever blowing opportunities.\n\nTottenham failed to seize ‘key moment’ at West Ham, says Mauricio Pochettino Read more\n\nIn fairness this was not a terrible display by a team that have undoubtedly made progress this season but Pochettino’s side did fall below the standard they set in recent months when whittling Chelsea’s lead down from 13 points to four. There was an unfamiliar stodginess to their play and their defence wobbled uncharacteristically. That contrasted with the vigour of a West Ham side battling to guarantee their own survival in the top flight, alleviate pressure on Slaven Bilic and heap misery on their London rivals. Job done.\n\nPlay Video 0:54 Tottenham missed 'key moment' in loss to West Ham, says Pochettino – video\n\nIt was at this stage last season that Spurs unravelled in the title race, a draw at home to West Brom betraying a loss of nerve that resulted in Pochettino’s team failing to win any of their last four matches. Winning here would strengthen the conviction that they have evolved since then but Spurs began tentatively and never quite found their rhythm, even if Adrián had to make a handful of decent saves to prevent them from taking the lead.\n\nThe atmosphere at kick-off was as electrifying as it can get in an arena that tends to suck energy out of a football crowd. A crunching challenge by Eric Dier on Cheikh Kouyaté in the third minute added fuel to the fervour. But mostly West Ham were on top in a helter-skelter opening. Home fans leapt to their feet in anticipation of a goal when André Ayew clipped the ball into the path of Lanzini, whose run from deep caught Kyle Walker off-guard. Mercifully for the England international Lanzini skewed a feeble shot wide.\n\nWalker started despite reported disagreements with his manager over fitness and a mooted transfer, and most of the trouble that West Ham went on to cause came down his flank, where Aaron Cresswell made the sort of raids that Walker usually inflicts on others. That was another thing for the manager to discuss with the defender.\n\nIn the 12th minute Cresswell sent a dangerous cross to the back post where Byram headed wide. Moments later Walker was caught out again and was booked for clipping Lanzini.\n\nSpurs’ best moment came midway through the first period, when Adrián made a rigmarole of saving a long-range shot by Harry Kane. José Fonte did well to block Dele Alli’s follow-up, then Kane tried again from 15 yards and Adrián redeemed himself by sticking out a foot to divert the ball over the bar. Dier went close with a header from the ensuing corner but Adrián blocked that, too.\n\nHugo Lloris was unflustered until the 27th minute when he charged out of his box to thwart Lanzini. He did so in a manner that only goalkeepers seem to get away with, hurling himself knees-first at the ball and then following through to take out the opponent. West Ham’s fiery protests cut no ice with Anthony Taylor.\n\nChristian Eriksen tried to give the home side something else to worry about but his low shot from 25 yards fizzed just wide. But that was Spurs’ only effort at goal after the earlier salvo. So at half-time the hosts were more satisfied than the visitors. And smiles were probably forming on the faces of any Chelsea players tuning in.\n\nTottenham suffer capital punishment as West Ham dethrone ‘kings of London’ | Barney Ronay Read more\n\nSpurs had 45 minutes to avert deceleration in the title race but they found nothing in the tank. Ayew let them off when he blasted over the bar from the edge of the area. The Ghanaian was denied a chance to atone when Jonathan Calleri overhit an easy through-ball.\n\nWalker flashed his attacking quality by splitting West Ham’s well-drilled defence with a sharp through-ball. But Eriksen fluffed the resultant chance, a gentle sidefooter from eight yards never likely to beat Adrián. Son fired off a better effort a few minutes later but the goalkeeper saved again. Then West Ham finally summoned the cutting edge to punish Spurs.\n\nUnsurprisingly the danger came first from the left wing, Cresswell delivering a cross to the back post. Ayew could not get a decisive touch as the Spurs defence panicked but the ball rolled to Lanzini, who was free six yards from goal. He lashed it into the net and ran to savour the acclaim of the crowd. The fact that a crash barrier collapsed amid the celebrations, injuring one fan, went unnoticed by most spectators but demonstrated that questions remain about this stadium’s suitability for such events.\n\nSpurs never looked like equalising. Indeed Calleri should have deepened their misery after nicking the ball off Toby Alderweireld but he shot too close to Lloris.

That the scorer was a player who has been blunted at times by calf trouble this season, and whose contribution can be eclipsed by the more lavish forward thinkers in Liverpool’s ranks added to the drama.\n\nCan will go into the final 12 months of his contract at Anfield in July with talks over a new deal at an impasse and the player himself having suggested he would prefer to be playing a deeper-lying role in the side. The real issue may be financial, though much more of this and he may be likelier to secure his wage demands than a change of position.\n\nLiverpool departed this arena with a place in next season’s Champions League still in their own hands. The damage done by that home defeat by Crystal Palace eight days previously does not feel quite so severe in the aftermath of this result and the slips endured by both Manchester clubs over the weekend, with Can’s winner shifting Jürgen Klopp’s team four points clear of fifth-placed United. Win their last three games, against Southampton, West Ham and Middlesbrough, and they cannot be ousted from the top four. Those contests will not be straightforward, as Klopp was keen to point out, but rather that than a game of catch-up.\n\nThe visitors’ manager had actually made a beeline straight for Prödl, rather than Can, at the final whistle with nervous tension having long set in. He had been aghast seconds earlier when Tom Cleverley’s punt, and Stefan Okaka’s flick, had forced the loose ball on to the far post where the centre-half lurked to belt a shot on to the crossbar with Liverpool’s lives flashing before their eyes. It was actually the hosts’ best opportunity of a night of frustration but it ensured the overriding sensation at the final whistle was one of intense relief in the away dugout.\n\nKlopp offered Prödl consolation through a smile before making his way into the corner towards the visiting support where all his frustration, pent up from the defeat by Palace, was released as he punched the air in celebration.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Emre Can celebrates his goal.

Liverpool had overcome the early loss of Philippe Coutinho to a dead leg, sustained in a fourth-minute challenge with Mariappa, to find some rhythm amid the huff and puff with Adam Lallana restored to their ranks. The England midfielder had had only “two proper sessions and a recovery session”, according to his manager, after five weeks out with thigh trouble, and yet his presence provided a level of reassurance.\n\nLiverpool roll up sleeves to beat Watford but still show familiar flaws | Paul Doyle Read more\n\nIt had been Lallana who planted a volley from Gomes’s punch four minutes from the interval which looped back over the goalkeeper and the muddle of bodies in the box to strike the woodwork. That superb effort would be trumped in what time remained before the break.\n\nThey were more assured once ahead, carrying a threat through Divock Origi and, late on, Daniel Sturridge with Gomes saving well from both, and they appeared to be repelling Watford with relative ease. M’Baye Niang’s bright start fizzled out, Troy Deeney was outnumbered and nullified, Simon Mignolet saved smartly from Daryl Janmaat, and Étienne Capoue – such a regular source of goals earlier in the campaign – saw his best effort tipped over the bar. Walter Mazzarri ended up slapping the side of his dugout at his team’s inability to make proper inroads.\n\nThere is a level of grumbling dissatisfaction at this club even after a season where they have rarely been embroiled in a relegation scrap. Watford’s owners may sense the time is approaching for further managerial upheaval. “But we hardly gave them anything, really,” said the Italian. “They just scored a great goal. The kind only champions score.”"}, {"date": "30/04/2017", "arena": "Old Trafford", "attendance": 75271, "home_team": {"name": "Manchester United", "lineup": [{"name": "David De Gea", "yellows": [],

"report": "Manchester United conceded a late Gylfi Sigurdsson strike as José Mourinho’s side dropped two points in the race for a top-four finish after Wayne Rooney had given them the lead with a questionable penalty.\n\nRooney needlessly barged Jordan Ayew for the 79th-minute free-kick that Sigurdsson curled into the top right-hand corner. It left David de Gea stationary, the goalkeeper perhaps confused by Ander Herrera, who ran back from the wall on to the line and then out again. To add to a difficult day for United, Luke Shaw and Eric Bailly went off to join a lengthy injury list.\n\nMarcus Rashford may also be the subject of much discussion after his fall for Rooney’s 45th-minute spot-kick came when he looked for contact with the Swansea City goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski.\n\nSwansea’s Paul Clement accuses Marcus Rashford of winning penalty by deceit Read more\n\nManchester City later drew at Middlesbrough, doubling the frustration for Mourinho as United stay in fifth place and a point behind on 65 points, with Liverpool level with Pep Guardiola’s side. Arsenal remain five points behind United after Sunday’s 2-0 defeat by Tottenham Hotspur, though they have a game in hand. It means that despite a 25th unbeaten Premier League match in a row for Mourinho’s side – a club record – achieving a Champions League berth via a top-four finish is out of their hands and their best hope to qualify may lie with the Europa League.\n\nThe United manager said: “We lost players and we lost points, so yes today was bad. You cannot isolate the performance out of the context. This is the ninth match of April – it is not human. We have a squad of 22 that is reduced to 13 or 14 players. The players are very tired.”\n\nUnited’s success in the EFL Cup by beating Southampton 3-2 in the final and progress in the Europa League – they play at Celta Vigo in the semi-final first leg on Thursday – means the side will play a minimum of 63 matches this season and Mourinho again criticised the fixture scheduling. “It’s a consequence of our success but also of something that you cannot be punished for,” he said.\n\n“Because we play the League Cup final, and then you have to play the [rearranged] game midweek. Why you don’t stop the [Premier League] competition when you play the final? Imagine if we go to the FA Cup semi-finals we will be playing Tottenham last weekend, that Burnley game then would also to be played later. When? When? When will we be playing that game? After the FA Cup final? In June? In next pre-season?”\n\nPlay Video 1:58 ‘High levels of fatigue’: José Mourinho on Manchester United’s draw with Swansea – video\n\nMourinho said if they reached the Europa League final he might field a shadow side against Crystal Palace on the final weekend of the season if the match is meaningless.\n\n“It was a blessing that we didn’t play the FA Cup semi-final but we go to the same problem, you are punished for doing well and if we beat Celta, we have the final on the Wednesday and we play against Crystal Palace on the Sunday,” he said. “We play Southampton two days before. So again maybe this result is also a blessing because maybe I can bring Nicky Butt [the academy director] and his team to play against Crystal Palace and hopefully Crystal Palace doesn’t need a game to stay in the division because it would be very bad if they needed the points for us to play with the under-23s.”\n\nIf Rooney’s 252nd goal for the club cheered Mourinho what happened before and after would not have done. Shaw was forced off after eight minutes and Bailly just before the hour, each with leg injuries. As the latter became the fourth frontline central defender to be unavailable, Matteo Darmian, a full-back, had to come on and fill in.\n\nShaw was one of four changes made by Mourinho, who also brought in Rooney, Jesse Lingard and Ashley Young. Antonio Valencia, Darmian and Henrikh Mkhitaryan made way, with Marouane Fellaini suspended.\n\nPaul Clement’s side, who showed one change with Ki Sung-yeung coming in for Leroy Fer, went close to an early goal. Ayew slipped into a gap left by Bailly but his shot was blocked by the French defender, whose attempted clearance ricocheted off Sigurdsson and the ball rolled to safety.\n\nUnited’s dubious penalty was awarded when Rashford went down going past Fabianski, who kept his hands close to his body. After a noticeable pause the referee Neil Swarbrick pointed to the spot, a decision from the referee that left Fabianski and the rest of his team-mates “furious”, Clement said. Mourinho, on his way to the changing room, watched his side take the lead from the tunnel.\n\nSigurdsson’s equaliser was merited and Swansea deserve much credit for the way they fought back. The point could be invaluable in their fight against relegation. They remain third bottom, two points behind 17th-placed Hull City.\n\nMourinho will have Paul Pogba and Fellaini back for the Vigo trip plus a fully fit Juan Mata, who was an unused substitute against Swansea. But he has to think about who will play at centre-back and who can be potential substitutes for the position should he suffer further ill fortune in north-west Spain. He said Phil Jones and Chris Smalling were likely to remain unavailable despite his repeated public entreaties to hurry them back from leg injuries."}, {"date": "30/04/2017", "arena": "Goodison Park", "attendance": 39595, "home_team": {"name": "Everton", "lineup": [{"name": "Maarten Stekelenburg", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mason Holgate", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Jagielka", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Williams", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leighton Baines", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Idrissa Gueye", "yellows": [78], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Davies", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Enner Valencia", "yellows": [58], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [72]}, {"name": "Ross Barkley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dominic Calvert-Lewin", "yellows": [38], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [72]}, {"name": "Romelu Lukaku", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Joel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Arouna Kone", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [72], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin Mirallas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [72], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gareth Barry", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ademola Lookman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matthew Pennington", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonjoe Kenny", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Chelsea", "lineup": [{"name": "Thibaut Courtois", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "César Azpilicueta", "yellows": [40], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Luiz", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [82]}, {"name": "Gary Cahill", "yellows": [35], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [79], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Moses", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "N'Golo Kanté", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nemanja Matic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marcos Alonso", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pedro", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [66], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [82]}, {"name": "Eden Hazard", "yellows": [75], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [85]}, {"name": "Diego Costa", "yellows": [56], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Asmir Begovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cesc Fàbregas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [82], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kurt Zouma", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathan Aké", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [82], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willian", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [86], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [85], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michy Batshuayi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathaniel Chalobah", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Antonio Conte would not say it but his body language had already confessed. When the final whistle sounded on a pivotal win at Goodison Park, the Chelsea manager strode across the pitch to conduct celebrations before a jubilant away support. He leapt on Thibaut Courtois’s back. He bounced up and down in front of the Bullens Road stand. He led the applause. He knew. The Premier League title is in sight.\n\n“A great win, a great win,” was as far as the Italian coach would go when pressed on the wider significance of victory at Everton. On paper this had been the toughest assignment left for Chelsea in their pursuit of the crown. On the pitch for 66 minutes it proved as much, with Ronald Koeman’s side holding firm and the contest delicately poised. Diego Costa and Eden Hazard had both missed inviting chances in the first half. The combustible centre-forward’s irritation was growing against a team that had won its last eight matches on home soil. Then Pedro let fly from 20 yards and the ball was in the top corner of Maarten Stekelenburg’s goal before the Everton keeper knew it. They had found a way, as champions always do.\n\nVictory, and a first clean sheet in eight games, rewarded a patient, organised and clinical display from Conte’s team, who added gloss to the scoreline with a scrambled goal from Gary Cahill plus a well‑worked one from the substitute Willian. Idrissa Gueye had man-marked his former Lille team-mate Hazard to good effect throughout but Chelsea’s array of creative options ensured they were not contained. “Compare the offensive parts of the two teams today,” the Everton manager requested. “That was the biggest difference and the reason we lost.”\n\nManchester United stumble as Gylfi Sigurdsson seizes point for Swansea Read more\n\nHis resources stretched, Koeman was again reliant on youth and sought to unsettle Chelsea’s three-man defence with a forward trio of Dominic Calvert‑Lewin, Romelu Lukaku and Enner Valencia. Chelsea called on experience and a winner’s mentality and subdued the hosts before punishing them with three second-half strikes. Conte praised his substitutes Willian and Cesc Fàbregas for their professionalism and willingness to contribute, not sulk, when not in the starting lineup. “Great men as well as fantastic players,” the Chelsea manager said.\n\nThere was an intensity to both teams to begin with, one that would not be sustained until the visitors turned on the style in the final stages, with Calvert-Lewin hitting a post in the second minute after being released by Ross Barkley. The rebound rolled invitingly for Lukaku to convert against his past and potentially future club but Cahill intervened with a crucial block. The Chelsea defender soon tested Stekelenburg with a 25-yard drive spilled by the Everton goalkeeper and hacked clear by Ashley Williams. A frenetic, open start suggested a captivating contest ahead but it developed into a physical struggle before Pedro’s decisive intervention.\n\nChelsea carried their customary, incisive threat on the counterattack but their final delivery often undermined the quality of their approach work. Their rhythm may have been disrupted by knocks to Costa and Hazard inside the opening 20 minutes, the former left feeling his knee following a committed but clean tackle by the excellent Tom Davies, the latter after colliding with the advertising hoardings, but Koeman’s tactics were also a factor.\n\nChelsea find new ways to win after Everton briefly subdue Eden Hazard | Paul Wilson Read more\n\nGueye shadowed Hazard’s every step as the Everton manager paid the Belgium international the compliment his abilities have merited this season. With Morgan Schneiderlin sidelined for 10 days by a thigh injury and Gueye spending much of his afternoon chasing Hazard to the corner, Everton offered Chelsea the space to dominate central midfield. Thanks largely to the prodigious work-rate of Davies, the visitors were unable to control the contest but still, as so often this season and as is the hallmark of champions, Conte’s team never lost their sense of purpose.\n\nOnly Chelsea posed a genuine threat after the restart but they had rarely tested the Everton goalkeeper when Pedro produced a moment of brilliance to break the deadlock. Collecting a pass from Nemanja Matic 25 yards from the Everton goal, the Spanish winger turned Phil Jagielka to his right, then his left before sending an unstoppable drive into the top corner of Stekelenburg’s goal. It was a finish whose impact would have been felt at White Hart Lane.\n\nThere was an element of fortune about Chelsea’s second when Hazard, having been fouled by Gueye as he sprinted down the left, drove the resulting free-kick low into the Everton six-yard box. The delivery took a slight deflection off Gueye and Stekelenburg could only palm the ball on to Cahill, who scored via his knee.\n\nJob done, Hazard was replaced by Willian with five minutes remaining and the Brazilian sealed what was ultimately a comfortable win seconds later. Costa released Fàbregas to the byline and the midfielder cut the ball back perfectly for Willian to beat Stekelenburg with a routine finish. Conte’s roar of delight could be heard around Goodison on the final whistle. “We’re gonna win the league,” his supporters sang.

Middlesbrough finally remembered how to score.\n\nIt left Guardiola’s side clinging on to fourth place, a point in front of Manchester United and Steve Agnew’s Boro agonising about what might have been. Although arithmetically still in with a chance of salvation, realistically they are all but doomed to relegation, with this mini-revival proving horribly tantalising.\n\n“We deserved to win,” Guardiola said, to mild surprise. “They created two chances and were fighting to survive but we were the better team.” If City’s manager was frustrated to see his hopes of finishing third receding after “a most difficult game”, home fans felt slightly cheated, their overall sense of the afternoon’s cruelty exacerbated by the slightly contentious circumstances surrounding the award of the penalty for City’s first equaliser. Not that the consequent disappointment should detract from Boro’s best performance of the season.\n\nFew could have predicted it when, with 45 seconds gone, Jesus very nearly scored from close range, the newly fit forward just failing to get a sufficiently strong contact on a ball sent whizzing across the box by Sergio Agüero. Little did anyone know that would represent their most menacing first-half moment as their back three failed to provide the desired attacking springboard.\n\nAgnew is a Guardiola disciple and enthuses that he has “admired him and his philosophy for years” but such fandom was temporarily parked as Boro’s interim manager urged his side forward. This bold strategy soon saw Álvaro Negredo slicing a Fabio centre across goal. It seemed the ball required only the slightest of touches to be diverted beyond Willy Caballero but no one was in quite the right place at quite the right time.\n\nIf that could be an epitaph for Boro’s season, Agnew’s players were not minded to surrender. Closing City down industriously, concentrating assiduously and winning their fair share of tackles, they ensured Guardiola had more than the capriciously swirling wind to worry about.\n\nPersistent gusts left the tail of City manager’s long black, designer-cut raincoat flapping almost as frantically as his arms. With his side yet to test Brad Guzan, he had genuine reason for anxiety. It proved justified when Negredo gave Boro the lead against his former club. George Friend’s interception precipitated a quick break which concluded with Stewart Downing cutting back, Friend dummying and Negredo, who seemed to slip as he shaped to shoot, directing a slightly scuffed left-foot shot in off a post.\n\nThe time had come for Guardiola to press a few tactical buttons and, sure enough, a recalibrated City emerged for the second period reconfigured with a back four and Kevin De Bruyne relocated to the left. With his side continuing to malfunction and still without a shot on target, only four minutes of the second half had elapsed before Guardiola hauled Aleix García and Gaël Clichy off, introducing Leroy Sané and Raheem Sterling.\n\nInitially this infusion of pace and width had limited effect: despite City monopolising possession and attacking in numbers, Boro held creditably firm until Kevin Friend awarded that controversial penalty.\n\nBursting into the box at speed, Sané accelerated into Marten de Roon, who looked to be merely standing his ground, before the winger collapsed dramatically. Given that there was clearly contact, possibly exaggerated by Sané conveniently leaving a leg trailing behind him, the referee’s decision seemed understandable but it was hard to see what the midfielder could have done to avoid it.\n\nBoro protested long and vociferously but, once calm was restored, Agüero sent Guzan the wrong way courtesy of an accomplished right-footed kick lifted into the top corner. “There’s a sense of injustice,” Agnew said. “The player went down very easily. It wasn’t a penalty. Marten’s a very intelligent boy and he’s not one for making contact in the penalty area. The referee didn’t have a clear view but, if you give them, you’ve got to be 100 per cent certain.”\n\nUndeterred, though, Boro again took the lead, exposing City’s defensive vulnerabilities in the process. When Adama Traoré’s pace won a free-kick and Caballero could only parry Downing’s subtly curved delivery, his defenders, and Vincent Kompany in particular, failed to cope with the fallout. It meant Negredo was able to propel the ball across the box for Calum Chambers, excellent at both ends, to squeeze it home.\n\nWith the decibel level hitting new heights the Riverside was rocking only for such reawakened optimism to be cruelly punctured by a swiftly taken free-kick, a chipped Agüero cross and Jesus’s header. “I think we should have seen the game out,” said Agnew, who might just have earned himself a chance to manage Boro in the Championship. “But I’m so proud of the lads.”"}, {"date": "30/04/2017", "arena": "White Hart Lane", "attendance": 31811, "home_team": {"name":

Yet they have waited so long for this kind of one-upmanship against Arsenal, the team they always measure themselves against, it would be impolite to start with the negatives when, finally, they can remind themselves what it will feel like to conclude the season looking down on the old enemy.\n\nIt has been 22 years since the last occasion and, to put that into context, the scorer of their first goal, Dele Alli, had not even been born during that troubled season, 1994-95, for Arsenal when George Graham was sacked and Stewart Houston’s side came in 12th, five places below the team from White Hart Lane. Spurs have now won nine games in a row and, in the process, they have moved 17 points ahead of a side that have only five more matches to go. This season, there will be no St Totteringham’s Day. The schadenfreude belongs the other way round now and, though it has felt inevitable for some time, there is a neat symmetry for those jubilant Spurs fans that Arsenal happened to be the opponents on the day it was confirmed.\n\nTottenham Hotspur v Arsenal: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nAgainst all that, the downside came in the form of what had happened earlier in the day and the message Chelsea obstinately delivered in their 3-0 victory at Everton, the game most observers reckoned might be the toughest assignment of their run-in. Spurs played like a team who still believe they can catch and overhaul the side at the top of the table and another win at West Ham United on Friday would close the gap to a solitary point. Yet Chelsea, once again, looked formidable opponents and it might not have been a coincidence that Mauricio Pochettino’s side took a while to get going, having started their latest victory shortly after learning the news from Goodison.\n\nOnce they shook their heads clear, however, they were so dominant during the second half that, in the far corner, Arsenal’s fans could be seen heading away in droves long before the final whistle. Once again, their team had come up short and another set of crowing supporters could be heard chanting “we want you to stay” in Wenger’s direction. The Frenchman will almost certainly grant them their wish at a time when many of his own club’s supporters are campaigning for precisely the opposite. These are the kind of occasions that will harden opinion against him – a fifth defeat in their last six league fixtures away from the Emirates Stadium, with 15 goals conceded – and the Arsenal manager must have been pained by his team’s inadequacies.\n\nIt could conceivably have been even worse if the referee, Michael Oliver, had not given Alexis Sánchez the benefit of the doubt after a handball in the penalty area during the period of second-half pressure when the home side repeatedly threatened Petr Cech’s goal and Wenger’s players seemed to be in the grip of a collective meltdown.\n\nBy that stage Harry Kane had already scored one penalty, courtesy of Gabriel’s naive trip on the striker, and there were the telltale signs that Arsenal had reverted to all their bad habits: flimsy at the back, short of leadership and not enough players taking responsibility. For Alli’s goal, there were half a dozen players in red and white shirts in proximity inside the penalty area. Not one made a challenge as Christian Eriksen weaved past Nacho Monreal and Laurent Koscielny to create the first shooting opportunity. The rebound fell to Alli and, again, the inaction of his opponents would have been staggering if this was not such a repetitive failure of Wenger’s sides in the modern era.\n\nEnergía universal: how Pochettino has driven the Tottenham revolution | David Hytner Read more\n\nTo begin with, Arsenal had looked reasonably competent, quick to the ball and hustling their opponents, with their front players under instructions not to allow Spurs to play out from the back. It was a clever ploy, forcing the home side into mistakes, but Spurs would still have been entitled to reach half-time believing they should have been in front. Eriksen had skimmed the crossbar with the best opportunity of the opening 45 minutes. Alli had headed another decent chance wide and Jan Vertonghen, letting fly with a diagonal shot from 20 yards, forced a fine save from Cech, one of the few Arsenal players to emerge with any credit.\n\nIt was not until the second half, though, that Spurs started to play with the authority that comes from having not lost a league fixture on their own ground all season. At 2-0, Vertonghen tried his luck again and Cech clawed away a curling shot that was heading towards the top corner. Spurs attacked with great purpose, accumulating 20 shots throughout the game, and there was never any genuine sense their opponents would save themselves after that three-minute spell when both goals were scored. It was only the second time Arsenal have failed to score on the last 37 occasions these sides have met in the league and, as has become the norm, Sánchez and Mesut Özil quickly faded once the game started to drift away from them.\n\nSpurs have now won 77 points, seven more than they managed last season, with four games still to play and, as Pochettino pointed out, their ambitions are not restricted to finishing above Arsenal. His is a team that should be looking up, not down. The only problem is Chelsea – and the refusal of the league leaders to show any real vulnerability."}, {"date": "29/04/2017", "arena": " Mary's Stadium", "attendance": 31120, "home_team": {"name": "Southampton", "lineup": [{"name": "Fraser Forster", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cédric Soares", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Stephens", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Maya Yoshida", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Bertrand", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Davis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Oriol Romeu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sofiane Boufal", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [58]}, {"name": "Dusan Tadic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathan Redmond", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [87]}, {"name": "Manolo Gabbiadini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [59]}], "subs": [{"name": "Shane Long", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [59], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jay Rodriguez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [87], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Caceres", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Ward-Prowse", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pierre-Emile Højbjerg", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joshua Sims", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [58], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mouez Hassen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Hull City", "lineup": [{"name": "Eldin Jakupovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ahmed Elmohamady", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andrea Ranocchia", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Maguire", "yellows": [70], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andrew Robertson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alfred N'Diaye", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Samuel Clucas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lazar Markovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Evandro", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [72]}, {"name": "Kamil Grosicki", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [83]}, {"name": "Oumar Niasse", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Tom Huddlestone", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [83], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Abel Hernandez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shaun Maloney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Dawson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Markus Henriksen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [72], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Marshall", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jarrod Bowen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "The wait for an away win under Marco Silva goes on but this felt every inch like one as Hull City garnered another priceless point in their fight for Premier League survival.

No team has conceded more penalties in the top flight this season.\n\nManchester United v Swansea City: match preview Read more\n\nThe game exploded into life in the final seconds, with Cedric Soares hacking Oumar Niasse’s effort off the line in added time after Tadic’s penalty was saved. The 1,000 or so travelling supporters sang Silva’s name relentlessly and Hull’s revival under the Portuguese is still very much alive after stopping the rot of five straight away defeats. They were brave in possession and Silva felt he could take plenty of encouragement.\n\n“I want this in our team,” he said when asked about Hull’s intent to attack. “It’s not easy because of the position we are in the table, but this is our football. We play like that at home and away as well. Our players showed big, big courage again. We played very well, more in the first half, but in general in the game. The way we played gives more confidence to our players.”\n\nThe pressure is now on Swansea City, three points behind Hull, to get a result against Manchester United on Sunday.\n\nSilva, wearing an open-necked white shirt, stalked the touchline at a sunbathed St Mary’s where Southampton were left chasing shadows for much of this contest, especially that of Kamil Grosicki. He struck the side-netting inside the first couple of minutes before hitting the post with a superb free-kick.\n\nFraser Forster, the Southampton goalkeeper, was again out of sorts, gifting Lazar Markovic the ball before Steven Davis fouled the Liverpool loanee to allow Grosicki to wrap his right boot around the ball from the edge of the box.\n\nSunderland relegated from Premier League after defeat by Bournemouth Read more\n\nThere were few positives to pinpoint for Southampton but Soares’s whipped ball caused a moment’s panic in the Hull back line only for Andrea Ranocchia to ease his countryman Manolo Gabbiadini aside, allowing Jakupovic to collect.\n\nSouthampton were tedious in their approach, guilty of overplaying at times and repeatedly second best. Sofiane Boufal’s attempt to nutmeg Sam Clucas was met by groans and a growingly restless home crowd, who booed their team off at the interval and again at full‑time.\n\n“We are angry like the fans and we have to accept this,” Claude Puel, the Southampton manager, said. “Our play was too poor, too slow but congratulations to Hull because it was an important game for them also. It was a poor game for us. We didn’t deserve to win and we are angry because we didn’t do what we needed.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Maya Yoshida appreciation society. Photograph: Hannah McKay/Reuters\n\nPuel sought personnel changes shortly before the hour mark, with Gabbiadini, starved of service, and Boufal replaced by the former Hull forward Shane Long and the academy graduate, Josh Sims.\n\nSouthampton’s uninspiring performance was summed up by second-half miscommunication between Long and Redmond, with the confusion resulting in Hull moving up the pitch and earning a free-kick. Saints had a couple of half-chances with Davis and Tadic volleying high and wide, but were left shortchanged by a resilient defence, led by Harry Maguire, who was again outstanding. Silva said he predicts the 24-year-old centre-half will have a “big career in the future”.\n\nHull’s early attacking promise faded a little but they continued to run themselves into the ground. Sometimes, though, it was not enough, as when Long’s pace left Ranocchia in a spin, forcing his partner, Maguire, to clear the danger. Maguire then threw himself in front of the ball to deny Long a simple finish.\n\nSouthampton had suddenly come alive. Tadic forced Jakupovic into another smart stop but his party piece was still to come. When Yoshida fell under N’Diaye’s challenge in the box, Tadic stepped up to convert from the spot but Jakupovic dived low to his left to push the ball – and his team – that little bit closer to

his best, after the Stoke City keeper kept a clean sheet in front of the England manager, Gareth Southgate, in just his second game since returning from a 13-month injury lay-off.\n\nButland twice denied André Ayew – once from an overhead kick – and used his leg to thwart Manuel Lanzini as the Potters recorded a 0-0 draw with West Ham United in their goalkeeper’s first home appearance since March 2016.\n\nIt was while playing for England in Germany that month that Butland fractured his ankle, and two further setbacks kept the 24-year-old sidelined until his comeback at Swansea City last weekend.\n\nSouthgate, who had swerved the Manchester derby to watch rugby league on Thursday, will have been encouraged by Butland’s performance ahead of England’s games with Scotland and France in June, and Hughes knows his ambition is to be his country’s No1 again.\n\n“When you have got dominance, sometimes the opposition can break and make chances, and you need a top-class keeper to make match-defining saves, and that is what Jack did,” said the Stoke manager after the stalemate at the bet365 Stadium.\n\n“All top clubs need keepers like Jack. There have been a couple of false dawns. It has taken 12 months to get him back and we are all delighted he is showing the form he did prior to the injury.\n\n“Jack enjoys the England setup. He had just broken in at senior level, but first things first – we are just two games into his return.\n\n“We were caught out just prior to the start of the season, when he broke down again. Clearly his ambition is to be the No1 keeper for England. Gareth knows him, and I am sure the reason he was here today was to see him. I think he was his captain in the Under-21 setup.”\n\nThe draw moved Stoke up to the 40-point mark in the Premier League, while West Ham are only one away from such a figure after a game in which they needed Adrián’s brilliant one-handed save to deny Saido Berahino a maiden Stoke goal, and his first for anyone in 427 days.\n\nBerahino’s barren spell has not stopped Stoke’s supporters warming to the striker and his luckless start to life in Staffordshire was summed up when he lost this footing as Xherdan Shaqiri looked to play him through.\n\nAnother block, this time from José Fonte, prevented him from converting Joe Allen’s cross, while the former Southampton captain was equally alert to stop Marko Arnautovic turning home Glen Johnson’s pull across.\n\nThe Hammers lacked creativity outside of Lanzini, but Ayew did display some ingenuity with an overhead kick that provided Butland with his first test.\n\nWest Ham are eight points above the drop zone, though that margin could be trimmed to five again if Swansea win away to Manchester United on Sunday, and their manager, Slaven Bilic, is not prepared to declare safety as a certainty ahead of contests with Tottenham, Liverpool and Burnley.\n\n“We need more points, it may be enough,” Bilic said. “We don’t want to come into the last game of the season with the radio on and keep asking ‘what is the score there?’. We would love to avoid it.\n\n“We are not panicking, but we are not safe. Nine points to play for. We need more points.”\n\nSunderland relegated from Premier League after defeat by Bournemouth Read more"}, {"date": "29/04/2017", "arena": "Stadium of Light", "attendance": 38394, "home_team":

Hull City’s draw at Southampton pushed Sunderland unceremoniously into the Championship, leaving their manager staring blankly into space.\n\nWhen the final whistle blew, Moyes, who acknowledges he is considering stepping down at the end of the season, stood a little apart from his assistants. As the calls for his head from a previously very quiet crowd gathered intensity and invective, he looked dejected and alone.\n\nAfter the bleakest and least imaginative of campaigns punctuated by one-dimensional tactics and inadequate recruitment, it was the least the former Everton, Manchester United and Real Sociedad coach could expect. Yet much as Moyes has failed to impress, many of the club’s manifold problems are rooted in the boardroom where Ellis Short, the owner, should not escape blame.\n\nSunderland relegation ‘my worst day in football’, says David Moyes Read more\n\nGiven his club’s dramatically superior fanbase and infrastructure – not to mention top-10 wage bill – Short should be ashamed Bournemouth are safely in mid-table while Sunderland supporters contemplate an uncertain future. Yet the beauty of the Premier League is that it remains a meritocracy in which innovative coaches such as Eddie Howe and well-run clubs, however small, can thrive.\n\nBy way of reminding their hosts of this reality, Howe’s Bournemouth began by forcing a series of corners. With the lively Marc Pugh clearly on a mission to torment Donald Love, Moyes’s right back, the home defence was soon in all too familiarly shambolic mode.\n\nAdmittedly Fabio Borini’s viciously swerving shot forced Artur Boruc into a good save but King, who has scored more goals than Sunderland during 2017, missed four first-half chances as his side monopolised possession.\n\nIf Bournemouth were playing a three-dimensional, high-definition passing game, Sunderland’s tactics seemed from the analogue age and principally featured the ball being pumped in Jermain Defoe’s direction as early and directly as possible.\n\nKing’s most audacious attempt involved him changing pace, cutting in from the left and unleashing a curving, dipping shot which hit the underside of the bar and the inside of the far post before somehow rebounding, bagatelle style, to safety.\n\nGoodness knows what might have happened if Didier Ndong, Sunderland’s best player, had not been around to hold the home midfield together. The Gabon international’s interceptions repeatedly broke up wave on wave of blue-shirted attacks.\n\nNdong kept Sunderland in a game in which Moyes’s players might have startled everyone by taking the lead had Defoe not directed a six-yard volley straight at Boruc after springing the offside trap.\n\nAfter that little cameo Howe started to cut an ever more agitated, and animated, figure in the technical area. Try as they might – and Benik Afobe had a shot blocked by Javier Manquillo, while Love cleared off the line from King – his players’ slight hesitancy in front of goal dictated they could not quite turn their technical and creative advantages into goals.\n\nIt left Sunderland harbouring hope of snatching victory on the counterattack. Shortly after Pugh had shot fractionally wide, one such break, early in the second half, concluded with Borini collecting Defoe’s pass and, once again, bringing the best out of Boruc.\n\nBy now the attendance figure had been announced as a significantly lower than average yet still a respectable 38,394. No one could be blamed for staying away yet the absentees left an awful lot of vacant red plastic seats – many sun-bleached by the passing years and badly in need of replacing – scattered in clusters around the ground.\n\nSocial media posts had suggested there would be vociferous anti-Moyes protests but the mood was strangely subdued, more about apathy than anger and punctuated by lengthy, slightly surreal, silences.\n\nPlay Video 1:32 Sunderland dragged down by 'long, hard season', says David Moyes – video\n\nPerhaps the pre-match hint Moyes dropped, indicating he may leave Sunderland in the summer, had drawn the sting from the dissenters and prevented a mutiny or maybe some of England’s most loyal fans simply had no energy left after such a draining, depressing campaign.\n\nThere was polite applause when Boruc – by now emerging as a suprisingly influential figure – saved smartly from George Honeyman following Defoe’s cute reverse ball but not even a mass bout of push and shove engaged in by every outfield player could raise the volume.\n\nEldin Jakupovic’s late penalty save earns Hull City vital point at Southampton Read more\n\nIt began with Borini catching Lewis Cook late, eventually involved everyone piling in to remonstrate with each other and ended with Stuart Attwell booking Borini and Harry Arter.\n\nClearly aggrieved, King forlornly demanded a penalty in the wake of Lamine Koné’s foul but managed to score in the end anyway. He shot assuredly low and right beyond Jordan Pickford after being played in by Ryan Fraser on a high-speed break.\n\nCue the first, initially tentative choruses of “We want Moyes out”.

lingering relegation fears were put to bed on an afternoon when Jamie Vardy continued his resurgence under Craig Shakespeare to score the only goal of a game that rarely came to life.\n\nIt was Vardy’s 15th of the season in all competitions and his eighth in 12 matches under Shakespeare – a run of form that has been central to propelling Leicester from the lower reaches of the table to 11th place. This was only Leicester’s second away victory in the league this season and takes them to the 40-point barrier with four fixtures remaining.\n\nSunderland relegated from Premier League after defeat to Bournemouth Read more\n\nAs for Albion, an excellent season has badly unravelled and this must have felt like groundhog day for Tony Pulis, their manager. This was a fourth straight defeat and a fifth successive league game without scoring, which is a club record, and it is hard to avoid the impression that their players signed off for the season when they beat Arsenal 3-1 six weeks ago.\n\nIt was a scrappy game throughout, low on quality and riddled with mistakes, one of which led to Vardy’s goal. Salomon Rondon, who has failed to score since December, gifted possession to Shinji Okazaki with a loose pass and Albion, normally so tight and compact, were suddenly wide open. Okazaki fed Vardy and the English international did the rest with the minimum of fuss, sweeping a right-footed shot from just inside the area beyond Ben Foster.\n\nUntil that point neither side had offered much in a fractious game that had threatened to boil over on a couple of occasions. Danny Drinkwater picked up a booking for a full-blooded challenge on Nacer Chadli – when Mark Clattenburg quickly reached for his pocket it was tempting to think that the referee was going to brandish a red card. Then Claudio Yacob was booked after catching Okazaki with an elbow. Clattenburg, in other words, was being kept busy in what is likely to be his last assignment in the Premier League before he takes up his new position as head of referees in Saudi Arabia.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Leonardo Ulloa goes up for a header. Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOther than Vardy’s goal, there was little to get excited about in the opening 45 minutes. Albion’s chances in that period were restricted to a couple of headers, with Kasper Schmeichel denying Christ Brunt at the far post and Rondon, back in more familiar territory at the other end of the pitch, glancing Chadli’s corner off target.\n\nEldin Jakupovic’s late penalty save earns Hull City vital point at Southampton Read more\n\nLeicester came close to scoring a second early in the second half. Vardy once again was involved, escaping in the left channel before sliding a low centre across the six-yard box and behind the Albion defence. Okazaki, stretching every sinew, was just unable to get a touch. Riyad Mahrez, cutting in from the right, swept another effort into the side-netting as Leicester began to attack with more conviction.\n\nAlbion, in contrast, looked flat, one-paced and devoid of ideas. Pulis responded by bringing on Darren Fletcher and James McClean in the second half to try to lift his team. James Morrison headed straight at Schmeichel late on but it was a routine save for the Leicester goalkeeper on a day when he had precious little to do in the face of a toothless Albion attack."},

years for this sensation but, at last, they have an away win to savour in the Premier League and, with it, surely another season to enjoy plenty more. This was a wonderfully resilient display, a performance forged on strong-arm defence and goalkeeping excellence, to suffocate Crystal Palace’s momentum. Sean Dyche’s team are eight points off the cut-off with winnable games ahead. A fine campaign is tantalisingly close to being rewarded with survival.\n\nThe away form feels like an anomaly for a team this organised, but that elusive first triumph on the road will have felt sweeter for all the waiting. The last Burnley player to score a winning goal outside Turf Moor in the top flight had been Danny Ings at Aston Villa on the final day two seasons ago, a victory secured once relegation had already been confirmed. Here the honours fell to Ashley Barnes and the substitute Andre Gray on the counterattack, but the win owed more to the efforts of Tom Heaton, Michael Keane, James Tarkowski and the visitors’ tireless collective work rate.\n\nSunderland relegation ‘my worst day in football’, says David Moyes Read more\n\nThere were countless headed clearances and timely interceptions. Keane has been excellent all year so his display was perhaps to be expected, but Tarkowski was making a first Premier League start after 15 cameos off the bench. The former Oldham and Brentford defender was struck by a cigarette lighter flung from the home support in the Holmesdale stand – not the first time that offence has occurred from that area – as Burnley’s players celebrated their early lead.\n\n“He wouldn’t have felt it, he’s got a big head,” Dyche said. “Look, Keano often gets the headlines, but Tarky was making his first start against a player like Christian Benteke, gets hit by a lighter and still retains his focus. He was absolutely outstanding.”\n\nAs were the entire backline. Time after time, Palace’s delivery ran aground on yellow shirts, with Benteke outnumbered and nullified and Wilfried Zaha whipped up into a frenzy of frustration on the flank. Once the home side’s anxiety had kicked in, there was no recovering composure. Without the reassurance of Mamadou Sakho at the back and Yohan Cabaye’s class in midfield, they were undermined at the end of a draining week. It came as no surprise to see George Boyd liberating Gray five minutes from time to sprint away from Damien Delaney and score emphatically inside Wayne Hennessey’s near-post.\n\nThat merely confirmed the worst for Palace. Their disjointed first-half display had given way to more frantic pressure late on, but they ended up infuriated by everything from Burnley’s refusal to wilt to the rather haphazard display from the referee. The focus was drawn to Zaha crumpling under Jon Flanagan’s challenge.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ashley Barnes opens the scoring. Photograph: Nigel French/PA\n\nSam Allardyce said: “He took Wilf’s heel, tackled him from behind and didn’t make contact with the ball so, in my opinion, it’s 100% a penalty. But I’m not sure the referee would have given anything today, inside or outside the box. There were some very strange decisions. Some really poor decisions.”\n\nIn truth, the real oversight had been made by a linesman when Zaha sprinted clear 15 minutes in to be clattered by Tom Heaton.\n\n“Wilf’s gone through and is onside, and not just by a few inches … by a yard,” added Allardyce. “That’s a big turning point. An assistant referee puts his flag up and the goalkeeper upends Wilf, which is him sent off and them down to 10.” Heaton would save superbly from Delaney before the end. The goalkeeper is another gem in Burnley’s ranks.\n\nIn truth, an 11th home defeat for Palace told a familiar toothless story. This club are still on edge. Seven points clear with three games to play may seem comfortable, but the locals have seen that margin disappear in the final week of a Premier League campaign before to result in demotion. They were panicky here from the moment Luka Milivojevic surrendered possession early on to Sam Vokes. The ball was eventually fed wide to a galloping Stephen Ward and, even with the full-back’s centre initially miscontrolled by Barnes, the striker was still able to tuck home the opening goal from close range.\n\nThey created other opportunities, with Hennessey and Martin Kelly denying Vokes his own plunder, but needed only Gray’s to secure the point. “This win has been coming,” said Dyche. “We got our tactical plans right today, and the players delivered them to perfection.” He is not resting on his laurels quite yet but Burnley are two points off ninth and as good as safe. For once, they could enjoy a long journey home."}, {"date": "27/04/2017", "arena": "Etihad Stadium", "attendance": 54176, "home_team": {"name": "Manchester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Claudio Bravo",

this draw as a useful result if it helps with the business of finishing in the top four. Yet it still felt slightly unsatisfactory for Manchester City after their second-half superiority and it was a strangely subdued derby at times, lacking any real incident until the moment late on when Marouane Fellaini reminded us of his worst traits.\n\nFellaini was so incensed by his red card – and so determined to prolong the argument with Sergio Agüero – it needed a clutch of Manchester United colleagues to usher him away. It was a display of hotheadedness that might warrant a Football Association charge and, not for the first time, it was difficult to find any mitigation for a player who has a history of violent acts. The difference this time is that Fellaini did not get away with it in the way he often has. His butt on Agüero was committed directly in front of the referee, Martin Atkinson, and could easily have sabotaged United’s night but for some more clear-headed thinking from the other players in red.\n\nManchester City 0-0 Manchester United: five talking points from the Etihad | Jamie Jackson Read more\n\nOn the balance of play, Guardiola can certainly reflect his side had enough chances to secure the win that would have moved them above Liverpool into third position. Instead, they remain in fourth, a point behind Jürgen Klopp’s team but with a game in hand. United are a point further back, on the back of a 24-match unbeaten run in the league, and Fellaini ought to be relieved his team-mates managed to withhold a late onslaught during which the substitute Gabriel Jesus, returning from injury after 10 weeks out, thought he had scored a late winner. The Brazilian had strayed offside as he headed in Agüero’s cross and the game was denied a dramatic conclusion.\n\nUnfortunately for City, this was one of the rare occasions when Agüero was let down by his finishing, turning the game’s first clear chance against the post and then missing the target with a decent opportunity in stoppage time. In between, there were other opportunities for Agüero and his team-mates but, for the most part, they were only half-chances and too many were aimed straight at David de Gea. Kevin De Bruyne featured prominently but, for all their possession, City missed David Silva’s influence against a side who showed the resilience that comes with not losing in the league for six months. To sum up the second half, the home side accumulated 117 passes in the final third of the pitch. United managed seven.\n\nPerhaps it was tactical on Mourinho’s part to play more conservatively after half-time. Yet in the opening 45 minutes Marcus Rashford, Anthony Martial and Henrikh Mkhitaryan, interchanging positions across United’s front line, often had the pace to trouble the three thirtysomethings – Vincent Kompany, Pablo Zabaleta and Aleksandar Kolarov – in City’s defence.\n\nRashford also had the beating of Nicolás Otamendi and, unfortunately for Claudio Bravo, his presence will always encourage City’s opponents. Bravo had to go off in the 79th minute after injuring himself catching the ball and, if City are to sustain a title challenge next season, it feels imperative they bring in a more trustworthy goalkeeper. United’s best opportunity came from one of his mistakes even if, to give him his due, Bravo spared his own embarrassment by saving the shot from Mkhitaryan.\n\nThe pattern of the game shifted in the second half, with Leroy Sané and Raheem Sterling finding more space and Agüero working manfully to unsettle City’s opponents. City always look better when Kompany is playing and Guardiola’s only complaint afterwards was they could not be more clinical with their chances.\n\nUnited played with great discipline until Fellaini, booked moments earlier for a foul on Agüero, challenged the same player again and everything quickly escalated. Agüero went down for a second time and Fellaini lost the plot, believing the striker had exaggerated his fall to try to conjure up a second yellow card. What followed was a clear sending-off and Mourinho should have criticised his player rather than blaming Agüero, remarking he had seen the Argentinian in the tunnel and “no broken nose, no broken head, his face nice as always”. Agüero not needing a hospital was no excuse for Fellaini’s stupidity and he will miss Sunday’s game at home to Swansea City, plus the trips to Arsenal and Tottenham.\n\nMourinho also reported that Timothy Fosu-Mensah had joined the club’s lengthy injury list during his short time on the pitch as a substitute but this was also a night when Daley Blind might have shown United’s manager he can cope in central defence alongside Eric Bailly, rather than needing to rush back Chris Smalling and Phil Jones from injury.

Wembley on Sunday but the relief to snatch a win from the jaws of a dreary draw was still worth savouring. Wenger might have the FA Cup in his sightlines but he can also cling to the possibility of a 19th consecutive Champions League qualification thanks to a freakish late goal.\n\nIt felt like one of those days with which Arsenal are familiar against a dogged opponent, where the sideways passes can be soporific and the chances not taken. In the 86th minute the ball pinged around an increasingly anxious Arsenal attack only for a deflected cross to end up with Nacho Monreal, who swung a leg at it. The ball was flying off target only to be diverted in off Robert Huth’s chest.\n\nWith that stroke of fortune a Wembley hangover turned into an unexpected Emirates Stadium party. Somehow Arsenal have won three games on the trot and have moved to within four points of Manchester City, and six of Liverpool with two games in hand on the latter. After a dismal few weeks all is not quite dead.\n\nEriksen closes the gap for Tottenham with precious winner at Crystal Palace Read more\n\nWenger chose his words pointedly on their chances of making up the remaining ground. “We have advantage of clarity; we have to win our games,” he said. “We cannot be happy with a 0-0. We have to gamble to win the game at any cost.”\n\nArsenal might have got lucky but, as their manager pointed out, they ended up with four attackers on the pitch plus a forward-minded midfielder in the shape of Aaron Ramsey. He felt that “initiative” was rewarded.\n\nStill, it was hard to stomach for Craig Shakespeare, who had seen his team operate in full hard-to-beat mode before Huth’s accidental intervention. “We had to put blocks on. We had to defend,” he said. “To lose in the manner we did was very disappointing. It was a cruel deflection because it wasn’t even on target. We have to recover quickly. We have another tough away game on Saturday.”\n\nArsenal have their own tough assignment at the weekend, away to their nearest and not so dearest at White Hart Lane. With this rendezvous positioned between two emotionally charged occasions – the FA Cup semi-final and the north London derby at White Hart Lane on Sunday – Wenger made changes in every department of the team. Sticking to his shiny new formula based on a defensive trio, notably the attack was rejigged to allow Alexis Sánchez a central role.\n\nIt was the Chilean who took centre stage in a more theatrical way late on in the game as Leicester psyched themselves up to try to salvage something. As Christian Fuchs prepared to take a throw‑in, Sánchez infringed closer than the laws of the game allow to try to block the ball being launched into the danger zone. After a couple of false attempts, Fuchs hurled the ball at Sánchez’s shoulder and after a momentary pause the Arsenal attacker fell holding his face. He was booked.\n\nShakespeare did not wish to make too fine a point of it and Wenger was phlegmatic after the event, explaining: “I think he didn’t know he had to be further away. The referee didn’t tell him, so he thought he was in the right position. After that he got a yellow card because he didn’t respect the rules. On top of that Fuchs was lucky not to get a yellow card because he threw the ball at him on purpose.”\n\nSánchez later got a cut lip in a collision with Huth and Wenger thought Yohan Benaloune was on the lucky side to avoid more serious sanction when he aimed a high kick at Olivier Giroud’s back. It was one of those Wenger likes to call a dark orange.\n\nIt says a lot about the quality of the game that the fiery moments were more eye‑catching than much of the play. Leicester had a couple of chances in the first half and Arsenal tested Kasper Schmeichel on a few occasions before the fateful decider.\n\nOnce the contretemps blew over and the points belonged to Arsenal, Shakespeare implored his team to refocus as fast as possible. “We need to dust ourselves down very, very quickly,” he said. “We need some more points on the board, we are disappointed not to get them but we move on to West Brom on Saturday.”\n\nAnd what of Sánchez’s reaction to it all? “If you know Alexis you don’t worry about what happened there,” Wenger said. “He will be the same tomorrow and the same on Sunday.”"}, {"date": "26/04/2017", "arena": "Riverside Stadium", "attendance": 30742, "home_team": {"name": "Middlesbrough", "lineup": [{"name": "Brad Guzan", "yellows": [],

"Middlesbrough finally got round to winning their first Premier League game of 2017 as the so-called “derby of the doomed” represented a new nadir in David Moyes’s increasingly troubled Sunderland tenure.\n\nMoyes was sunk by Marten de Roon’s early goal to leave Sunderland fans demanding his sacking and contemplating imminent relegation to the Championship which, depending on results, could be confirmed by Saturday tea-time.\n\nAs the visiting supporters’ “We want Moyes out” shouts gathered both volume and momentum, Steve Agnew and Boro were left clinging to a shred of renewed hope yet, six points short of 17th-placed Hull City, they still seem destined shortly to join their north-east neighbours in the second tier.\n\nRobert Huth’s own goal gives Arsenal welcome win over Leicester City Read more\n\nPerhaps appropriately, it was an awful game with both sides fully emphasising why they are propping up the rest of the division and why Sunderland remain 12 points in arrears of Marco Silva’s side.\n\n“It was a tough one to take,” said Moyes, who took exception to the shouts of “You’re not fit to wear the shirt” directed at his players from the away end. “We played quite well at times but didn’t create enough chances. We came up short but it wasn’t for a lack of character. I wouldn’t think criticism is due on tonight’s performance. I couldn’t name a single player who didn’t fight for the shirt.”\n\nThe calls for his head met with similar defiance. “It’s to be expected,” he said. “But let me tell you, it’s the first time it’s happened at a club I’ve been at. I’m used to winning so I’m not enjoying losing. But I’m the manager here, I’m not going anywhere and I’ll take it on the chin.”\n\nAsked if he felt a little shown up by Silva’s success on a relative shoestring at Hull, Moyes replied: “It’s good when people come in and do well but, in the Premier League, you judge people over 14 or 15 years.”\n\nA slightly less stressed Agnew celebrated his first victory since succeeding Aitor Karanka. “It wasn’t as fluent and eye-catching as we would have liked but we hadn’t won since December so it was important,” the interim manager said.\n\nThe evening began on a sad note with a tribute to Boro’s former defender Ugo Ehiogu. As pictures of Ehiogu in action filled the ground’s big screen and time seemed temporarily turned back, Boro fans reprised those once so familiar, suddenly haunting, chants of “Ugo, Ugo”.\n\nDavid Moyes charged by the FA over female reporter ‘slap’ remark Read more\n\nHis old side began firmly on the back foot with Sunderland’s Jermain Defoe – seeking a first goal in nine games – swiftly testing Brad Guzan’s reflexes with a low left-foot volley unleashed after he met Didier Ndong’s chipped pass.\n\nUnfortunately for Moyes, false dawns have been something of a recurring theme on Wearside and this soon seemed simply the latest in a long line. Things began to go wrong for the visitors when De Roon scored at the end of Boro’s first real attack. It began with a wonderfully chipped through-ball dipped over the top of Sunderland’s defence by the unattended Adam Clayton and concluded with Agnew smiling, quite possibly for the first time since the 4-0 thrashing at Bournemouth on Saturday.\n\nHaving easily gone between the equally disappointing Billy Jones and John O’Shea before seamlessly controlling that dropping delivery with his chest, De Roon struck. Taking advantage of Jordan Pickford’s advance from his line, he extended his right boot and poked the ball past the goalkeeper.\n\nPickford is extremely useful with his own feet and was soon using them to mop up the fallout from some alarmingly haphazard Sunderland defending, while also performing wonders to block Stewart Downing’s goalbound shot.\n\nBy now the away end was in full, echoing, voice. “Moyes out, we want Moyes out,” they chorused militantly, their mood barely appeased by the free-kick Wahbi Khazri curled in so beautifully Guzan did very well to repel it at the outset of the second half.\n\nFor a while Sunderland dominated possession but they rarely looked remotely like scoring and eventually Downing, who enjoyed some good moments, responded by using his guile and experience to gradually help readjust the power balance. Moyes may beg to differ but this was arguably his team’s worst performance this season.\n\n“Are you watching, Ellis Short,” sang their fans, before paying pointed, wistful homage to Moyes’s most popular recent predecessor, letting Sunderland’s owner know that Roy Keane’s reinstallation would be most welcome."}, {"date": "26/04/2017", "arena": "Selhurst Park", "attendance": 25596, "home_team":

is far from done and dusted. They laboured for long periods and, even when in the ascendancy after the interval, still often ran aground on Crystal Palace’s resistance. But Mauricio Pochettino and his players are not ready to give up the pursuit. Chelsea cannot rest easy just yet.\n\nThis tight, fiercely fought London derby was into its latter stages with Palace, a team reborn and recent victors over three of the top six, long since forced into a full-scale retreat when Spurs finally prised them apart. Christian Eriksen picked up possession in a rare pocket of space, territory which might have been swallowed up had Mamadou Sakho not departed with a serious knee injury, and whipped a shot from 25 yards which dipped in front of Wayne Hennessey’s outstretched right hand and fizzed into the corner.\n\nMauricio Pochettino: Spurs dreaming of more than only finishing above Arsenal Read more\n\nThe delight which erupted in the closest corner of the Arthur Wait stand, and was replicated on the visitors’ bench on the opposite side of the pitch, reflected as much relief as pride. Both emotions were justified. This had been a test of Tottenham’s psychological reserves, a scrutiny of their ability to react to defeat in the FA Cup semi-final and to Chelsea’s victory over Southampton on the previous evening.\n\nA seven-point gap had gaped overnight. A defeat would have dashed all their hopes. Even a draw would not have been enough. There was simply no margin for error and the team responded.\n\nThat will have pepped up Pochettino more than the nature of the victory. There had been uncomfortable moments up to the interval, when Andros Townsend and Wilfried Zaha had been at their most influential and James McArthur’s energetic late runs into the box had hinted at reward. Spurs had been anxious, hampered by Mousa Dembélé turning an ankle and Victor Wanyama’s caution for a lunge on Luka Milivojevic. The Kenyan committed another foul on Townsend before the interval and was taken off almost for his own good, and the switch to a more fluid, attack-minded approach thereafter coaxed confidence from the visitors.\n\nWhether they would have forced Palace back in quite the same relentlessly suffocating manner had Sakho not been forced off remains uncertain. The loss of a centre-half should not dictate a team’s entire approach but over less than three months the Frenchman had established himself as the life and soul of this selection, and a source of inspiration for the team.\n\nSeeing him crumple to the turf, twisting his left knee as his leg buckled and wincing in anguished pain, seemed to shock his team-mates. He departed on a stretcher, his season almost certainly over, with the body language of the home side instantly more downbeat.\n\n“Initially we fear it’s a ligament but which ligament we don’t know,” said the Palace manager, Sam Allardyce. “We hope it’s not the cruciate but there was certainly a hyperextension of the knee. We will see after a scan. So we’ve lost Mama, Scott Dann and James Tomkins, and we don’t know if any of those will be fit again this season.” Even with Martin Kelly in the best form of his spell at the club, and Damien Delaney now a veteran at this level, that recent burst of 19 points from eight games seems even more of a godsend for them. One more win should see Palace safe.\n\nSpurs need another five to stand a chance of achieving their own target, starting with Sunday’s north London derby against Arsenal, when victory would guarantee them a higher finish than their bitter rivals for the first time in 22 years. There was plenty to admire in their second-half approach here, where Harry Kane led the line impressively and Dele Alli sparked into life. It was the England midfielder who reached Kyle Walker’s vicious delivery only to steer his volley wide of the far post. At the time that miss seemed critical. Yet Eriksen, dictating his team’s rhythm from the centre, would eventually find his range.\n\nTottenham prove themselves up to the terms of a testing trial at Selhurst Park | Stuart James Read more\n\nThe Dane revels in space and, always on the move, he was never truly pinned down by Palace. McArthur and Milivojevic did their best but the playmaker glided beyond them too often. Once ahead, the visitors could trust in their own stingy defence. Palace barely mustered a shot of note in the second half, their energy sapped following Sunday’s exertions in victory at Anfield. Kyle Walker recovered his poise after a tricky first half to suppress Zaha, while Toby Alderweireld saw off Christian Benteke. Few markers have managed that over recent weeks.\n\nYet Tottenham can appear a class apart at times. Their eighth successive league win has shaved Chelsea’s lead and by kick-off on Sunday they might even have the incentive of reducing it to a single point. “It was a big challenge today, to be still alive in the title race,” said Pochettino.

The pressure has been thrust back on their closest pursuer. Over to you, Tottenham Hotspur.\n\nAntonio Conte had worn a scowl for much of this match, pounding his technical area as furiously as ever and kicking everything from water bottles to medical bags whenever his players’ concentration lapsed. “I wanted to kick the ball because sometimes, believe me, I want to play,” said the Chelsea manager in the aftermath as the adrenaline gave way to exhaustion. “But I know that if I kick the ball, the referee will probably send me off.”\n\nAnd yet, by the end, he was pointing to the heavens in delight as Diego Costa, a beast awakened, scored twice after the interval to nullify the visitors’ threat and banish memories of that recent 2-0 defeat at Manchester United.\n\nAntonio Conte praises ‘psychological step’ in Chelsea’s title push Read more\n\nThe Italian acknowledged just how significant this victory could prove to be, potentially sapping hope from Tottenham’s before their tricky trip to Crystal Palace on Wednesday night. “It feels like a massive step,” said Gary Cahill, whose thumping header had restored the home side’s lead in first-half stoppage time. Costa may have caught the eye with his first league goals since early March, but it was the captain’s timely effort which set the tone. His was the kind of goal John Terry might once have supplied.\n\nPlay Video 1:15 Chelsea's win over Southampton 'a big psychological step' towards league title, says Conte – video\n\nPlenty of Chelsea’s key performers had risen to this occasion before the end. Cesc Fàbregas was outstanding, striking delicious passes from deep when he was not trading challenges with Oriol Romeu. The cross he arced over from Eden Hazard’s short corner nine minutes into the second period proved to be his 103rd Premier League assist, with Costa holding off Ryan Bertrand to plant a header into the net. Hazard was a livewire, maintaining the high standards he has set all season. Southampton had been guilty of losing him early on as he ambled on to Costa’s lay-off, eluding Romeu in the process, to fire an accurate finish across Fraser Forster and into the corner.\n\nThen there was Costa, such a frustrated presence over recent weeks, rediscovering his touch after five scoreless performances in the league. His second goal seemed like a release, the passes snapped swiftly between the forward and Hazard, then Pedro, before he wrong-footed Fraser Forster and slid in the fourth. Conte has always pointed to the forward’s selfless contribution, running the channels and unsettling defenders, but he needed proper reward for those efforts. Should he depart for China in the summer he would be going into his last month with Chelsea bolstered. A title would be a fitting way to go out.\n\nChelsea needed this after Old Trafford. There had still been periods when Southampton’s players, fresh from a weekend off, had threatened to wrest the initiative but just as at Wembley in the FA Cup semi-final against Tottenham, the more clinical team would prevail. The visitors were at their most troublesome when Soufiane Bufal and Dusan Tadic were scuttling down the wings, fed by the busy energy and canny deliveries of Steven Davis and James Ward-Prowse.\n\nThe England midfielder had delivered the corner from which Chelsea conceded, for the 11th Premier League game in succession, before the half-hour mark. Nemanja Matic’s inadvertent flick had set the home defenders on their heels, with Manolo Gabbiadini allowed time to collect and turn inside before poking the loose ball back across goal. Thibaut Courtois’ touch presented it to Romeu and the former Chelsea player simply could not miss.\n\nThere was a period thereafter when Chelsea threatened to wilt, but a barnstorming run down the right from N’Golo Kante seemed to shake them awake once again, with Cahill’s telling contribution delivered shortly afterwards. The centre-half had spent two nights in hospital last week recovering from a severe bout of gastroenteritis, and missed Saturday’s semi-final. “The lads didn’t miss me at Wembley,” he said. They needed him here, easing away from Cédric Soares as Southampton’s back-line laboured to repel crosses from either flank in quick succession. Marcos Alonso looped a header back towards the six-yard box where Cahill powered his attempt down and in. He had actually risked an immediate return to casualty by taking the header clean off Costa’s boot as the striker attempted an overhead kick.\n\nChelsea did not look back and even offered Terry his first taste of Premier League football since November in what time remained, with Bertrand’s late goal for the visitors a mere consolation.\n\nConte’s side now need four victories from their remaining fixtures to become champions, although that is supposing Tottenham maintain winning form during their trickier run-in. Spurs have no leeway and the leaders will watch events at Selhurst Park on Wednesday with interest, but they can sense the title edging ever closer. “We must be confident about the future,” added Conte. “We only have to think about ourselves.”"}, {"date": "23/04/2017", "arena": "Turf Moor", "attendance": 21870, "home_team": {"name": "Burnley", "lineup": [{"name": "Tom Heaton", "yellows": [],

"Manchester United enter Thursday’s 174th derby with Manchester City knowing victory at the Etihad Stadium will leapfrog them over Pep Guardiola’s side into fourth place after this convincing win.\n\nYet José Mourinho suggested winning the Europa League, another route into the Champions League, is preferable. “If we beat Celta we go to the final and, yes, it is important to us to play in the Champions League but this club wants trophies. We have 25 per cent chance to win the Europa League.”\n\nBefore the recalled Wayne Rooney’s 251st goal for the club Anthony Martial became the first United man to score at Turf Moor in the league since Lou Macari in 1976. In doing so he cost another £8.5m payment to Monaco, a clause being triggered by Martial reaching 25 goals for the club. This may raise his fee to £44.5m but the near £40m dividend yielded if Champions League qualification is achieved means United will hardly care.\n\nChristian Benteke shocks Liverpool to lift Crystal Palace’s hopes Read more\n\nMourinho had implored Martial to up his performance level and afterwards he said: “Yes, it was very good. With the ball, without the ball, in the middle of two strong central midfielders, without anyone behind him because we had no No10.”\n\nIn characteristic manner the Portuguese again entreated Chris Smalling and Phil Jones to hurry up recovery from injury and be available for City. “Eric Bailly was incredible. If I was Smalling or Jones, I would play Thursday. I wouldn’t accept one guy to play nine matches in a row because I am injured,” said Mourinho. “If they have a crazy mentality like I have [they can play]. If they are safe thinking and are surrounded by people with the mentality they have, it is more time.”\n\nOn 90 minutes Paul Pogba was replaced by Michael Carrick and he was later seen hobbling to the team coach. “I don’t know if he is injured or just super-accumulation of fatigue in the muscles,” said Mourinho. “If he cannot play Thursday, he cannot play and we play another one. We don’t cry, like today. We cry because we have two important injuries, two important surgeries and periods of recovering and we feel for our friends.”\n\nThis referred to the serious knee injuries suffered by Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Marcos Rojo. While United’s players donned T-shirts featuring one of their names during the warm-up, Mourinho said: “I just think about them and like everybody I’m really sad.”\n\nMourinho had talked of protecting his players following Thursday’s 120 minutes against Anderlecht and made eight changes. Only Pogba, Bailly and Jesse Lingard were retained, with Rooney the notable inclusion. This was only a second league start since 17 December for the captain, who had clocked up only 86 minutes in total since 1 February.\n\nSean Dyche’s XI showed only Andre Gray in for the injured Sam Vokes in the manager’s belt-and-braces 4-4-2. United lined up as a 4-3-3 that put Martial as the central striker with Rooney and Lingard left and right of him.\n\nThe first half’s finest move resulted in the opener. This was a one-two fashioned over 70 yards as Martial collected, ran forward and passed right to Ander Herrera. The midfielder returned the ball to the Frenchman, who continued his run and nosed it coolly beyond Tom Heaton for a fourth league finish.\n\nThis was 21 minutes in. As the match passed the half-hour Robbie Brady spun in a dangerous ball from the right and later the same player swung in a free-kick from the left which caused Daley Blind to watch Ben Mee carefully while shepherding the ball out.\n\nAs the break neared, disaster struck at the other end for Burnley. Pogba held off Joey Barton and found Martial. His effort was half-blocked and Rooney doubled the lead. Gray went close with a shot but at the break United’s cutting edge gave them a deserved lead.\n\nThe question then was whether Burnley could grab a goal and affect United’s rhythm. Their problem continued to be final-third execution, with Brady often a culprit with aimless passing during the second half’s opening exchanges.\n\nLater Pogba showed the winger better use of the ball with a 25-yard shot at Heaton, which had the keeper sprawling left to prevent a third for the visitors. From here United coasted home after Michael Keane missed a late chance.\n\nBurnley have collected an admirable 32 points at this venue, the division’s sixth best home haul. They have beaten Liverpool and drawn with Chelsea and this was only their fifth defeat before their own crowd.\n\nBut Dyche’s squad are enduring a concerning wobble with only one win in 11 outings. They are only five points above the drop zone before travelling to Crystal Palace – who are two points above – on Saturday. “There is still work to be done,” the manager said.\n\nAnother indicator of what Mourinho is building is that his team are now 23 league games unbeaten, the best sequence in six seasons. “It compensates the fact we are not good at home,” said the manager.\n\nNow comes the

The striker had bruised, battered and beaten his former club on his return to Merseyside and may well have done the same to their top-four prospects. “I know people will think: ‘The Champions League slips through our fingers again,’” said Jürgen Klopp. “But only if we let it slip. Our job is to squeeze everything we can out of this season.”\n\nKlopp remained defiant in the face of Liverpool’s first defeat in eight games. Defiance is only a fleeting virtue in his Liverpool defence, however, and their top-four rivals will draw encouragement from how Sam Allardyce exposed weaknesses in recording his first league win at Anfield in 14 visits as manager. His Palace team are almost certainly secure in the Premier League after a third consecutive win at Liverpool and adding Klopp’s team to a recent list of scalps including Chelsea and Arsenal.\n\n“You must be sick of us,” the Palace fans chanted after Benteke scored twice, forced Dejan Lovren off after an accidental collision, dominated in the air and capitalised on another Liverpool lapse at a set-piece to decide the outcome. Allardyce targeted Liverpool’s flaws both at corners and behind their full-backs, and took great satisfaction afterwards in detailing how he did so, but a ponderous attack and a lack of options amid a growing injury list will also trouble Klopp. Anfield was a nervous place and with good reason, it transpired.\n\n“I told the boys after the game that it was frustrating, disappointing and we made mistakes,” the Liverpool manager said. “We have to feel it today. We don’t like it but defeats always make sense and there is a reason not only for what happened in the game but how you react. There is one wonderful month to go, four matches, and we will not give up. 100% not. We all need to get more used to it than we are, a game like this, when it’s not the biggest excitement. I could see it in a few faces, in the body language. I could hear it a little bit too. The boys have delivered a lot of excitement but now it’s about serious football, do what you have to do, and we will do it.”\n\nPhilippe Coutinho had ignited a slow-burning contest with a touch of brilliance, sweeping a free-kick from at least 25 yards over the Palace wall and just inside Wayne Hennessey’s right-hand post, though the goalkeeper’s positioning invited trouble in the presence of the gifted Brazilian. It was an exquisite strike regardless. “I couldn’t criticise my players for that goal,” said Allardyce. “They had to rely on Coutinho with a wonder goal to get in front.”\n\nLiverpool had required something special to break a strong Palace side and lift their own uncertain start. It was, therefore, infuriating for Klopp when the home side conceded a cheap but well-worked equaliser just as they appeared to be taking the game under control.\n\nLiverpool v Crystal Palace: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nCoutinho was central to Liverpool’s brightest moments. His perfect return ball to James Milner sent the left-back through on the Palace goal and it took an excellent challenge by Jason Puncheon to halt him. Emre Can then squandered a clear opportunity to double Liverpool’s lead when Milner released Georginio Wijnaldum to the byline and he cut the ball back for his fellow midfielder. Can arrived on cue but his mis-hit shot veered towards the corner flag.\n\nAllardyce’s team had offered little in the final third aside from a mazy run and low shot from Benteke that sailed wide of Simon Mignolet’s left-hand post. Their performance and threat improved considerably once Wilfried Zaha and Andros Townsend reverted to their natural wings, having started on the right and left respectively, and in Benteke they had a forward with the awareness and motive to capitalise on the nerves that crept into the Liverpool display.\n\nThe Belgium international, booked for diving under slight contact from Lovren inside the area, brought Palace level when the home defence was caught out by a simple clearance down the right from Joel Ward. Yohan Cabaye reacted quicker than Lovren to the defender’s ball and steered an inviting first-time cross along the face of Mignolet’s goal. The unmarked Benteke found the roof of the net with a controlled finish.\n\nSam Allardyce says ‘exceptional’ Crystal Palace exposed Liverpool weaknesses Read more\n\nBenteke grabbed his second when Liverpool’s weakness at defending set pieces, corrected to good effect at West Bromwich Albion a week ago, reared its ugly head once more. Townsend’s second-half corner evaded both Roberto Firmino and Puncheon at the near post, sailed behind Joël Matip and in front of the Palace centre-forward, who converted with a diving header.\n\nAnxiety was palpable around Anfield before Benteke struck, with Palace displaying greater composure in possession and Liverpool toiling in attack. James Tomkins blocked a goal-bound shot from Coutinho after the Brazilian had stayed on his feet after a clumsy challenge from Martin Kelly inside the penalty area.

In a match they desperately needed to win to boost their ever-diminishing chances of remaining in the Premier League next season, Middlesbrough were level for less than two minutes and collapsed thereafter.\n\nFernando Llorente and Tom Carroll seal Swansea’s vital win over Stoke Read more\n\nVictory at the Vitality Stadium, followed by a further three points in the game in hand they are yet to play, may just have been enough to revive their season. Instead, one day after the death of the club favourite Ugo Ehiogu, they endured their latest miserable turn under the caretaker manager Steve Agnew, who has overseen four defeats and two draws since his appointment.\n\nThe result, which was worsened by the dismissal of Gastón Ramírez, also takes Bournemouth to the relative safety of 12th – seven points clear of the bottom three with four games to play.\n\nThe ease with which the hosts took the lead did much to demonstrate why it is Middlesbrough who look certainties for relegation. Their near-uncontested build-up on the left wing created space for Marc Pugh to cross to Joshua King, who from in front of goal and similarly under minimal pressure routinely finished low beyond Brad Guzan.\n\nIf Agnew had given Middlesbrough any belief before kick-off, it quickly vanished from then, after which Bournemouth’s fluid football posed a constant threat. In the 16th minute further poor defending led to a second goal. Uncertainty in possession on the edge of the area invited Harry Arter to dispossess Adam Clayton, and when the loose ball fell to Benik Afobe he struck beneath the onrushing Guzan and into the back of the net.\n\nBournemouth almost immediately again threatened to score, when Pugh’s classy backheel played in King, but the forward sent his shot over the crossbar. The frustrated Ramírez had already been booked for diving after an earlier challenge from Adam Smith when in the 20th minute he lunged in on Pugh and was given a second yellow by the referee Graham Scott, effectively putting a comeback beyond his team.\n\nBy the 29th minute, when Marten de Roon forced a fine diving save from Artur Boruc when shooting ambitiously from midfield off the bounce from Álvaro Negredo’s knockdown, the only question was what margin of defeat Middlesbrough faced.\n\nTen-man Hull’s Sam Clucas seals win over Watford to boost survival bid Read more\n\nBournemouth played with patience and in the 65th minute Pugh extended their lead. A fine pass from the substitute Lewis Cook played him in, and from inside the area he curled across the face of goal and into the bottom-right corner. Their finest goal was also their last.

of exacerbating the woes of the Hull manager Robert Madley’s debatable interpretation of Niasse’s challenge on M’Baye Niang looked the sort of decision on which relegations can hinge and tens of millions of pounds be forfeited.\n\nYet, as the crowd howled in anger and anguish, Silva’s players evidently resolved to remind everyone that appearances can be desperately deceptive. Inspired by, among others, the excellent Sam Clucas, they responded to such adversity to register another victory in their once seemingly hopeless fight against relegation.\n\nFernando Llorente and Tom Carroll seal Swansea’s vital win over Stoke Read more\n\nThis latest win here left Hull having collected an extraordinary 19 points from a possible 21 on East Yorkshire soil since Silva succeeded Mike Phelan in early January.\n\nThanks to second-half goals from Lazar Markovic and Clucas, Hull kept their noses in front of Swansea City, staying 17th at the end of an afternoon that started less than auspiciously for a manager who has not lost a home fixture in England, Greece or his native Portugal for more than three years.\n\n“It’s a really important three points for us,” said Silva. “I don’t want to talk too much about the red card because I respect the referee’s job and I make mistakes sometimes too. But to play for 65 minutes with 10 men and win was fantastic from my players. I believe in these players and our work.”\n\nUnder the Portuguese’s tutelage Harry Maguire has turned into a much-admired young centre-half but before a minute was up his supposedly routine backpass to Eldin Jakupovic had morphed into a horribly mis-hit shot that whizzed inches wide of the far post.\n\nHad that gone in it would have been Watford’s first away goal in the Premier League since January and they kicked off as if on a mission to correct that statistic. Andy Robertson may be coveted by Liverpool but Silva’s left-back initially found Nordin Amrabat quite a handful.\n\nWith the stream of long balls pumped forward also bothering the less than jet‑heeled Maguire and Andrea Ranocchia, Clucas and company struggled to get their passing game going. Then, just as it clicked into rhythm, Niasse saw red.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Hull City’s Oumar Niasse is shown a red card during the Premier League game against Watford. Photograph: Gareth Copley/Getty Images\n\nGranted it was a little high, a little late, studs up and the striker’s boot appeared to fleetingly catch Niang below the knee but the striker’s challenge as they competed for the ball did not appear either reckless or totally out of control. It was certainly not a cynically calculated lunge and probably merited a yellow card.\n\nAlthough the impact seemed minimal and accidental, what possibly swung Madley’s decision was that, before collapsing in apparent, writhing, agony, Niang unleashed an anguished, piercing scream so loud it could be heard in one of England’s highest press boxes.\n\nWhen the winger finally rose to his feet one of his socks looked ripped but he was immediately able to run freely, albeit to a soundtrack of toxic, cacophonous boos every time he touched the ball.\n\n“My feeling was he hadn’t touched him but maybe a yellow card,’ said Silva. “We’ll appeal the red card, we’re hoping to have it rescinded.”\n\nThanks to a superb save from Jakupovic that somehow kept out Sebastian Prödl’s header the scoreline remained goalless at half-time but Madley had not been forgiven and was jeered off at the interval.\n\nIt did not help his cause that, by now, Walter Mazzarri was also on his case, Watford’s manager having taken exception to a bad challenge on Niang from Ranocchia that the referee had turned a blind eye to. Maybe the visitors’ sometimes unappealing gamesmanship had coloured the judgment of an official who might also have awarded Silva’s side a first-half penalty.\n\nJoshua King strike sets the tone as Bournemouth batter Middlesbrough Read more\n\nFuelled by righteous anger, Hull regrouped and, to wholesale astonishment, took the lead. No sooner had Jakupovic saved well from Étienne Capoue than they broke quickly with Kamil Grosicki sashaying down the right before crossing to the onrushing Lazar Markovic. Although the Liverpool loanee’s header bounced down on the goalline Markovic extended a boot and, crucially, lashed the ball in from point-blank range.\n\nShortly afterwards Clucas, a midfielder on Gareth Southgate’s England radar, took time out from helping hold things together in midfield to curve a free-kick wide of an upright.\n\nIt proved a preamble to a goal scored after Watford could only partially clear a corner. Having seamlessly chested the ball down, Clucas beat Heurelho Gomes with a sublime left-foot volley.\n\n“We underestimated the danger from 10 men,” said Mazzarri. “It makes me really angry but Hull were really, really good. They concentrated very well.

It has given the Liberty Stadium faithful hope that the Welsh team can pull off another great escape.\n\nTheir previous successful rescue mission came in 2003 when a 4-2 win over their current relegation rivals Hull stopped the Swans from falling out of the Football League. History could repeat itself, but this time by ensuring they extend their six-year stay in England’s top tier.\n\nHull’s unlikely win over Watford, where they played with 10 men for over an hour, means 18th-placed Swansea are still two points adrift of a safe position. However, their gutsy display proves they are up for the fight. The two-point gap could have been extended if Marko Arnautovic had converted his second-half penalty to draw Stoke level. His miss came seconds before Carroll doubled the lead.\n\n“It’s the first time I’ve called it a must-win game and I was right because if Hull had won and we hadn’t, the gap at five points would have been very difficult for us,” Clement said. “We created lots of chances and had a little bit of luck with the penalty miss. We haven’t had most things go our way but that little moment did. The momentum is with us. Hopefully it will give us that impetus to finish really strongly. We’re right behind Hull, breathing down their necks.\n\n“We were strong, aggressive and physical. I’m happy with the way we used the ball. It takes a lot of bottle to do that in a high-pressured game.”\n\nClement’s bold tactics paid off in a game he said was the club’s biggest since the Championship play-off final in 2011. The former Real Madrid and Bayern Munich assistant moved star man Gylfi Sigurdsson into his preferred No10 position in a new-look 4-4-2 diamond formation.\n\nSwansea pestered Stoke’s rearguard and were rewarded when their top goalscorer Llorente headed them in front in the 10th minute. The Spaniard connected with Sigurdsson’s corner and directed his header past Stoke goalkeeper Jack Butland, who was making his first Premier League start since fracturing his ankle in March 2016.\n\nLlorente’s 12th goal of the season came at the perfect time after the former Juventus striker had been criticised by Match of the Day pundit Frank Lampard for his lacklustre performance against Watford last weekend. Sigurdsson underlined his value once again. He has scored or assisted 20 of their 39 Premier League goals this term. Even if they avoid relegation, Swansea will find it difficult to keep the £35m-rated Iceland playmaker at the Liberty Stadium in the summer.\n\nSaido Berahino spurned two golden opportunities to not only draw Stoke level, but score his first goal in red and white colours since his £12m move from West Brom in January.\n\nThe former Swansea midfielder Joe Allen’s pinpoint cross found an unmarked Berahino, who somehow headed wide. He then failed to find the net again when he headed straight at Lukasz Fabianski from five yards, seconds before the break.\n\nTen-man Hull’s Sam Clucas seals win over Watford to boost survival bid Read more\n\nThe visitors started the second half with more purpose. Federico Fernández had to be at his best to block Arnautovic’s goal-bound strike.\n\nBut Fernández would go from hero to zero when his trip on Xherdan Shaqiri inside the box gave Stoke the chance to equalise from the spot on 69 minutes. Arnautovic stepped up and blazed his penalty over the bar.\n\nJust seconds later Swansea went up the other end and doubled their lead thanks to Carroll’s 25-yard strike, which took a mean deflection off Allen to beat Butland. Stoke could have lost by a larger margin if Butland had not denied Carroll and Jordan Ayew late on. Swansea then defended valiantly and this much-needed win keeps them in touching distance of survival.\n\nStoke are chasing a fourth successive top-10 finish under Mark Hughes but will have to improve on their dreadful away form if they are to do so.. They have lost eight of their last 10 away games.\n\n“I was disappointed with how we started the game because we talked about that beforehand and wanted to affect Swansea,” said Hughes. “But unfortunately we didn’t and they scored with their first corner . The match-defining moment was the penalty and it needed to go in from our point of view. We missed it and they went down the other end and scored from a deflected shot.”\n\nJoshua King strike sets the tone as Bournemouth batter Middlesbrough Read more"}, {"date": "22/04/2017", "arena":

the Premier League elite and proved Slaven Bilic is capable of some sly expectations management, as his scratch West Ham United team comfortably held Ronald Koeman’s side in their first goalless draw of the season.\n\n“I think we can do a really short press conference,” said a clearly enervated Koeman after the match. “I’m disappointed about the performance. We were not the team we can be; we were far away in every aspect. We didn’t bring intensity in the game, we had a lot of ball possession, too many players in the centre of the midfield, we took too much time to switch the play. If you start a game like this, it’s always difficult to change. Maybe the temperature was a little different from the last few weeks too. You try to find a reason, but it’s difficult.”\n\nKoeman was certainly right about the weather. With the sun shining across the open spaces of the London Stadium it was possible to detect a hint of summer in the air. Bilic embraced this theme of change, dropping his first-choice keeper, filling his first team with irregulars, his bench with kids and, finally, switching to an unfamiliar three at the back.\n\nJoshua King strike sets the tone as Bournemouth batter Middlesbrough Read more\n\nThat side, after an opening 30 minutes in which neither team seemed able to pass the ball or summon up any tempo, was well organised and composed, and Bilic declared himself pleased with the day’s endeavours. “Especially if you’re talking about how solid we were, how composed, how we kept the shape, I was very pleased,” he said. “If you’re talking about effort and determination there is nothing more to ask. Apart from set pieces, we had eight or nine situations where you are expecting to finish it with a good shot. I think we deserved to win the game.”\n\nBilic’s gameplan – to stifle the supply to Romelu Lukaku and break directly – became more and more effective as the game wore on. The first instance of note came when a counter from the little-seen forward Jonathan Calleri forced Idrissa Gueye into a lunging foul that brought a yellow card in the 27th minute. The subsequent free-kick led to a corner and, from that, the forgotten midfielder Havard Nordtveit picked off two strong long-range efforts that were first blocked by a defender and then held by Maarten Stekelenburg.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest West Ham United’s Jonathan Calleri leaps over Everton’s Phil Jagielka. Photograph: Tony O'Brien/Reuters\n\nIn the 36th minute, another succession of set plays almost ended in the opening goal, after Winston Reid won the ball from a Manuel Lanzini corner, played the ball back to the Argentinian, whose second cross was met by James Collins at the back post, but his header was wide. Five minutes later and Morgan Schneiderlin was forced to clear for another corner, after Collins caused more complications for Everton’s backline.\n\nWith the game scoreless and the visitors off the pace, Koeman made a double change at half-time, bringing off one teenager, Tom Davies, for another, Ademola Lookman, while Gueye, who had been booked, was replaced by Gareth Barry. “I made a signal to the team with the changes,” Koeman said, “but I feel sorry for Tom and Gana [Gueye] because if I was allowed to change 10 I would have.”\n\nSadly for Koeman, the substitutions brought little effect. Their only effort of any note in the entire match came from Lookman, but his long-range shot flew narrowly over the bar in the 75th minute. For the Hammers, José Fonte should have done better with a far-post header from an 89th-minute corner. To record any more events here would be to afford them too much importance.\n\nAll in all, West Ham will be happy with a draw. Their home form this season has not been much to write about and this was only their 22nd point from the London Stadium. Goalkeeper Adrián kept a clean sheet on his return and two more of the Hammers’ dead men, Arthur Masuaku and Edimilson Fernandes, turned in decent performances.\n\nEverton, meanwhile, surely waved goodbye to the Champions League dream in the meekest way possible.

Karanka a little earlier.\n\nAgnew has taken only two points from his five games in charge and Boro’s aim of avoiding relegation looks even less feasible than the prospect of Arsenal finishing in the top four but the Teessiders’ performances have improved markedly.\n\nSo much so that not only were Wenger’s experimental back three frequently made to sweat but the second half was sufficiently exciting for spectators to justify the decision to miss Broadchurch’s eagerly awaited denouement on TV.\n\nJohn Terry seeks Premier League stay after announcing plans to leave Chelsea Read more\n\nWith Hull and Swansea losing on Saturday, Middlesbrough had been teased by renewed hope. Six points behind Marco Silva’s 17th-placed side and two adrift of Paul Clement’s team with games in hand the possibilities tantalised.\n\n“We CAN make the great escape,” declared the local Evening Gazette’s giant backpage banner headline, conveniently ignoring the reality that Boro are the only English League side not to have recorded a victory during 2017.\n\nIf registering a first league triumph since mid-December seemed a tall order, Arsenal appeared strangely out of sorts and thoroughly distracted by Wenger’s delay in announcing whether he will still be in charge next season.\n\nArsenal had lost five of their previous eight league matches, failed to win away since January and arrived at the Riverside on the back of four straight away league defeats, each featuring the concession of three goals.\n\nThey departed having climbed to sixth and closed the gap on fourth-placed Manchester City to a still daunting seven points with a game in hand. It may be too little too late but this mild improvement reflected the extraction of a tactical rabbit from Wenger’s chapeau in the form of a switch to a defensive trinity for the first time in 20 years.\n\nThe last time Arsenal were configured in this way was in 1997 but the reappearance of 3-4-3 confirmed their manager accepted something had to change.\n\nPlay Video 0:37 Wenger revels in defensive switch and Arsenal's win over Middlesbrough – video\n\nInitially this velvet revolution looked less than seamless as Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, right wing-back for the night, took only four minutes to emphasise he is not a natural defender by collecting a yellow card for catching Fábio da Silva, the home left-back, late.\n\nHaving tried four different formations in as many games – back three included – Agnew reverted to 4-3-3. With Gastón Ramírez showing off some classy, defender-destabilising, touches, Boro began brightly. Suddenly feeling a chill possibly occasioned by more than just the fast cooling evening Arsenal’s manager reached for the comforting warmth of his club winter duvet coat and zipped it up tightly.\n\nHappily for him an injury to Fábio soon interrupted Boro’s rhythm, while Grant Leadbitter needed to watch his central midfield step after being booked for fouling Mesut Özil.\n\nAlthough Arsenal could conceivably have had a penalty when Dani Ayala manhandled Olivier Giroud at a corner, neither side had mustered a shot on target as the half-hour mark approached.\n\nGranted Marten de Roon had headed a partially cleared free-kick beyond Petr Cech but the midfielder was well offside. Both sides were struggling to click into any sort of passing groove but then Aaron Ramsey and Alexis Sánchez had a volley blocked and saved by Brad Guzan respectively. Sánchez was merely warming up and, with half-time fast approaching, the striker sent a 22-yard free-kick arcing over the wall for it to curve and dip well beyond a static Guzan.\n\nAwarded in the wake of Adam Clayton’s felling of Granit Xhaka it prompted Wenger’s first smile of the match and coincided with the start of a heavy rain shower which seemed to reflect Boro’s dampened optimism.\n\nGuzan was almost certainly unsighted by a somewhat over-staffed Boro wall but that would be scant consolation to those locals who had arrived hoping to witness an Easter miracle.\n\nThen, just as jokes about anyone believing survival dreams could be resurrected really needed to see a doctor sharpish, began circulating, the skies temporarily cleared and Boro equalised.\n\nIt began with the interception of a slightly slapdash Sánchez pass which permitted Stewart Downing to sashay down the right before cutting inside on his left foot and lifting a sublime cross in the direction of Álvaro Negredo. Bisecting a couple of defenders he proceeded to beat Cech courtesy of a fantastic flying volley.\n\nArsenal might quickly have fallen behind but Cech somehow kept out Ayala’s close-range header after a free-kick provoked panic among the backline. Members of the “Wenger to remain” camp looked a little crestfallen but Özil added welcome credence to their campaign by restoring Arsenal’s lead. With the much vaunted Ben Gibson and his fellow Boro defenders taking a turn to lose shape, Sánchez’s chip and Ramsey’s chest down led to the Özil lashing home at the near post.\n\nSo much for Sánchez and Özil being unsettled – not to mention Wenger’s supposed status as Arsenal’s “yesterday’s man”."}, {"date": "16/04/2017", "arena": "The Hawthorns", "attendance": 25669, "home_team": {"name": "West

that they have rediscovered the art of grinding out victories away from home and are tightening their grip on a top-four finish in the process.\n\nHot on the heels of their impressive win at Stoke last weekend, which was their first in the Premier League on the road this year, Liverpool clinched another three points away from Anfield and Roberto Firmino again made the telling contribution.\n\nThe parallels with Liverpool’s triumph at Stoke did not end there, however, as Simon Mignolet, who produced a couple of outstanding saves against Mark Hughes’s team, made another vital intervention against Albion by denying Matt Phillips as the winger broke through on goal with only 10 minutes remaining.\n\nTony Pulis had his head in his hands as Mignolet saved and the Albion manager must have felt like doing the same when Liverpool took the lead in first-half injury‑time. Scoring from set-pieces is supposed to be Albion’s forte, and defending them Liverpool’s achilles heel, yet the tables were turned here as Firmino, via a flick on from Lucas, headed in James Milner’s wide free-kick.\n\nIt was the Brazilian’s 11th Premier League goal of the season and provided the defining moment in a match that did not really come to life until the closing stages as Albion desperately pushed for an equaliser at one end and Alberto Moreno squandered a wonderful chance for Liverpool to put the game to bed at the other.\n\nWith Ben Foster caught upfield trying to score – Pulis made it clear to his goalkeeper afterwards that he never wants to see that again – Liverpool broke away and Moreno had options to his left and right. The substitute chose to go it alone, however, and stroked a 40-yard shot the wrong side of the post. It was tempting to wonder what Jürgen Klopp’s reaction would have been had Albion scored when they pumped the ball into the Liverpool area moments later.\n\nMignolet, though, was able to deal with the danger, punching clear at a time when his team needed him most, and shortly afterwards Klopp was jumping around on the touchline to celebrate a hugely important three points. “I hope you’re not surprised,” Liverpool’s manager said, when asked about his reaction at the final whistle.\n\n“This is one of the most difficult places to go because you can’t feel comfortable in one moment of the game. You need to be on the highest concentration level. But we have been actually. For us it was very important because showing this concentration level until the end didn’t work each week in the last few months, but today it was really good.”\n\nKlopp was reminded of the fact that Pulis, during spells in charge at Stoke, Crystal Palace and Albion, had never lost a home match against Liverpool before, yet maybe everything was in place here for that eight-match unbeaten sequence to end. Albion have enjoyed an excellent season and are still eighth but there are signs that things are tailing off now that they have passed the 40-point barrier. They have failed to score in four consecutive Premier League matches for the first time since 2003.\n\n“Missed chances,” Pulis said, when asked to explain that disappointing record. “We’ve had three really good opportunities where I would have expected to score but you can’t criticise the players. My one disappointment about our performance was the first 20 minutes of the second half. And they scored bang on half-time, a goal that we’re disappointed with because we think [Craig] Dawson was fouled. But we’ve still got to defend better.”\n\nFirmino was certainly grappling with Dawson prior to breaking free and stooping to head past Foster, although the chances are that Pulis would have expected the goal to stand if the same thing had happened at the other end. What is clear is that it was an awful time for Albion to concede.\n\nUp until that point they had frustrated Liverpool and restricted them to one decent opportunity, when Firmino dragged a low shot inches wide after Philippe Coutinho intercepted Claudio Yacob’s careless pass. Albion, who were playing mainly on the counterattack, had looked certain to score earlier on through Nacer Chadli until Firmino got the faintest of touches to prevent the Belgian from side-footing home. Hal Robson-Kanu later shot tamely into Mignolet’s arms.\n\nDespite those first-half scares Liverpool dominated possession and ought to have doubled their lead when Milner profligately volleyed Firmino’s cross over the bar just before the hour mark. Then came that late Phillips opportunityfor Albion, when Mignolet spread himself and stuck out a boot to block a shot that Pulis felt should have ended in the back of the Liverpool net."}, {"date":

Or, to use Ander Herrera’s description, “almost perfect”.\n\nChelsea still have a more obliging run-in than Tottenham Hotspur in second place but Conte’s men have seen a 13-point lead whittled down to four in just under a month and, if nothing else, it has applied an element of vulnerability to what was in danger of becoming a procession. Conte admitted afterwards that Spurs were now “the best team” and though it would be out of character for Chelsea to lose their nerve, perhaps United have shown the blueprint now for beating, or at least negating, the league leaders.\n\nMourinho cannot have found it easy to leave out Zlatan Ibrahimovic but the decision to drop his leading scorer was based on boldness rather than conservatism, and fully justified bearing in mind the chasing Marcus Rashford gave David Luiz and Gary Cahill. Rashford was exceptional but Herrera pushed him close to be recognised as the game’s outstanding performer on a day when the Spaniard was assigned an old-fashioned man-marking role on Eden Hazard. Herrera stuck to his man like a limpet but he also weighed in with the second goal as well as setting up the first for Rashford with an exquisite piece of vision.\n\nTo give Chelsea their due, Herrera also got away with an obvious handball before the opening goal, seven minutes in, but Conte did not try once to use that as an excuse for everything that followed. United’s starting XI had managed only 12 league goals all season but Mourinho had worked out everything to a T. It was his first win against Chelsea since leaving the club and though Conte still leads 2-1 on that front, it was also a reminder that opposition fans might have been a little premature this season in serenading United’s manager with chants of “you’re not special any more”.\n\nMourinho’s formation – a fluid 3‑1‑4‑1-1 – was certainly unorthodox but it was also designed to minimise Chelsea’s counter-attacking threat. Matteo Darmian, like Herrera, had his own specialist role, rarely leaving Pedro’s side. Ashley Young, an unusual choice for captain, seemed inspired by the role and was applauded off by his manager when he was substituted late on.\n\nIbrahimovic, Mourinho explained, has looked tired recently, but there was more to it than that. Mourinho not only started with Rashford but also had Jesse Lingard operating just off the striker, a decision based on the suspicion that Chelsea’s centre-backs would be vulnerable to quick, penetrative running.\n\nThat was certainly the case with the opening goal and the controversy surrounding Herrera’s handball should not entirely obscure the fact it was a beautifully weighted pass once the referee had given him the benefit of the doubt. All the same, it was easy to understand why Chelsea were aggrieved.\n\nThey had been on a promising counter-attack of their own when Herrera used his left hand to intercept Nemanja Matic’s pass. At this level it was poor from the referee, Robert Madley, to let it go, and in a matter of seconds Rashford was clear, running behind David Luiz, taking a couple of touches to steady himself and then angling his shot past Asmir Begovic.\n\nBegovic was in goal for Chelsea because Thibaut Courtois had injured himself in a promotional basketball shoot for the NBA and as if that was not galling enough for Conte, there was more disruption in the warm-up when Marcos Alonso was forced out with a virus.\n\nKurt Zouma was fast-tracked into the defence, with César Azpilicueta initially switching to Alonso’s role as a left wing-back before swapping places with Victor Moses on the right. It did not work on either side.\n\nChelsea had lost their full-strength XI with unfortunate timing but that does not fully explain their lack of cohesion. Moses was removed eight minutes into the second half and however much of a pest Herrera was, Conte is probably entitled to think Hazard ought to be accustomed to the close attention of opposition players. As for Diego Costa, he had one of those days when he seemed to base his entire strategy on antagonising whoever was marking him. It seems like old hat now, and Mourinho’s defenders had been drilled not to react.\n\nIf anything, the ordeal could have been even worse for Chelsea bearing in mind the dangers Rashford posed his markers and the lack of activity in David de Gea’s penalty area. Four minutes into the second half, Kanté’s heavy touch from a penalty-box clearance allowed Young to dispossess him. As Young moved into the penalty area, Zouma prodded the ball away and Herrera let fly from 20 yards. The deflection off Kanté wrong-footed Begovic and Chelsea, for the first time in a long while, no longer seem immune to danger."}, {"date": "15/04/2017", "arena": "White Hart Lane", "attendance": 31943, "home_team": {"name": "Tottenham Hotspur", "lineup": [{"name": "Hugo Lloris", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Walker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Toby Alderweireld", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jan Vertonghen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Davies", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eric Dier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mousa Dembélé", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [16], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Eriksen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [87]}, {"name": "Dele Alli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [84]}, {"name": "Heung-Min Son", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [19], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Kane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [48], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [79]}], "subs": [{"name": "Vincent Janssen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [90], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [87], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Wanyama", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [79], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kieran Trippier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Moussa Sissoko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [84], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joshua Onomah", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin Wimmer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pau López Sabata", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Bournemouth", "lineup": [{"name": "Artur Boruc", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Smith", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Simon Francis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steve Cook", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charlie Daniels", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Junior Stanislas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [69]}, {"name": "Harry Arter", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Wilshere", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [56]}, {"name": "Marc Pugh", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joshua King", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Benik Afobe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [77]}], "subs": [{"name": "Max Gradel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lewis Cook", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [56], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Allsop", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Fraser", "yellows": [70], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [69], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tyrone Mings", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lys Mousset", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [77], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Baily Cargill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "At times like these, with Mauricio Pochettino’s Tottenham utterly rampant, it is the points that got away from them earlier in the season that come to feel more and more significant. How about the two that they dropped in the 0-0 draw at Bournemouth in October? With just an extra couple to their tally, it would be possible to paint their Premier League title pursuit in an even more exciting light.\n\nAs it is, this procession in the north London sunshine against a team with glaring defensive flaws moved them to within four points of the leaders, Chelsea, who play at Manchester United today.\n\nTottenham are close but will they be close enough? What can be said with certainty is that they are finishing the season with a bang. There was so much to enjoy about this performance, from the zip, movement, flicks and incision in possession to the remorseless of their pressing when they did not have the ball.\n\nMauricio Pochettino says ‘the world tried to kill Tottenham last season’ Read more\n\nTheir defence, which is the meanest in the division, was never troubled and it said everything that the Bournemouth fans were reduced to mock celebration when Junior Stanislas and Charlie Daniels had shots towards the end.\n\nThere was a collector’s item goal for Mousa Dembélé to get Tottenham up and running – his first since January of last year – while Son Heung-min, Harry Kane and the substitute Vincent Janssen got the others. Kane has now reached 20 goals in the league for the third season in a row.\n\nIt was the 12th time over the campaign that Bournemouth had conceded three or more goals and they were lucky that the scoreline was not even heavier. Eddie Howe, the manager, said: “The danger is that everyone says we are safe. We are not.”\n\nIt was Tottenham’s day and a 15th consecutive win in all competitions here was all but secured by the 19th minute. That was all the time it took for Bournemouth to err badly at the back and Tottenham to punish them twice.\n\nFirst, Simon Francis allowed the ball to run out, wrongly believing that a goal-kick would be awarded. From Christian Eriksen’s corner, Dembélé was allowed the space to take a touch and finish from eight yards.\n\nIt was an afternoon to forget for Jack Wilshere, the on-loan Arsenal midfielder, who was jeered throughout and lost the ball to Eric Dier in the buildup to the second goal. It broke for Kane, who flicked on beautifully for Son and he accelerated past Steve Cook before shooting low past Artur Boruc from a tight angle.\n\nWilshere would leave the stadium on crutches, with his left foot in a protective boot, after he was hurt in making a challenge on Kane in the 53rd minute, as the striker shot for goal. He tried to play on after treatment only to realise that the pain was too great.\n\nIt had looked as though Howe ordered him to stay on while he readied the substitute, Lewis Cook. “I can’t move,” Wilshere shouted back at him, before he hobbled off. The Tottenham fans lapped it up.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Tottenham fans look on as Jack Wilshere walks off. Photograph: Dylan Martinez/Reuters\n\nPochettino had been unable to find room in his starting lineup for the fit-again Victor Wanyama, which was a reflection of his strength in depth and, also, the recent form of Dier and Son. The South Korean forward, who was moved to the left to accommodate the return of the England international Kane, has now scored eight goals in six appearances. Pochettino faces a selection dilemma for Saturday’s FA Cup semi-final against Chelsea at Wembley. Surely Son has to start?\n\nThe home crowd were subdued for long spells. It was as though they knew that their team did not need them to drive the team on.\n\nTottenham had plenty of other chances. Dembélé saw Boruc keep out a rasping 12th minute shot while Eriksen had two sightings of goal in the first-half and one more in the second. Kane was also denied by Boruc.\n\nPochettino raged at times in his technical area at what were only minor pieces of sloppiness from his players. The manager sets the standards for everybody at the club.\n\n“Our idea was to translate to the players that nothing was enough,” he said. “The only way to build that winning mentality is always to play with the same tempo and focus, whether it’s 1-0 or 4-0. The team must forget the scoreline.”\n\nPochettino could celebrate again early in the second-half when Kane got away from Francis far too easily to shoot home, while there were wild scenes in stoppage time when the Dutch striker Janssen scored at the second attempt for his sixth goal of the season in all competitions."}, {"date": "15/04/2017", "arena": "Selhurst Park", "attendance": 25504,

his players to “respect the point” ever since taking up the reins at Crystal Palace back in December, and on this evidence they are taking note. There was anxiety to endure over the last few minutes here as Leicester City, infuriated at having cast away a two-goal lead so wastefully, flung everything at the hosts in their eagerness to force a winner. A few months back, Palace might have wilted. Yet there is strength now where, only recently, fragility was all around.\n\nDanny Drinkwater fizzed Leicester’s best late chance just wide as Mamadou Sakho and Martin Kelly heaved to repel the barrage of centres and Jason Puncheon screamed instructions. Palace may have swarmed all over the visitors in the period immediately after falling two goals behind, missing as many presentable chances as they converted, but there was a deep sense of relief at the final whistle.\n\nTottenham keep pressure on Chelsea with hammering of Bournemouth Read more\n\n“It was a great point for us, a fantastic point,” offered Allardyce, with his side now seven points from the bottom three with a game in hand and a considerable advantage in terms of goal difference. “When you consider we scored two goals against Leicester, where Atlético only scored a freak penalty which wasn’t a penalty … it showed what we’re about.”\n\nLeicester will need to be more resilient than this in Tuesday’s quarter-final return leg against the Spanish side. Their best player here was Robert Huth, who followed up his early headed goal with a staggering series of timely blocks and interceptions – there were eight from Christian Benteke, Wilfried Zaha, Puncheon and Luka Milivojevic – but the German is suspended for next week. The sight of Yohan Benalouane cramping up will have concerned Craig Shakespeare, with Christian Fuchs an unconvincing replacement at centre-half once the Tunisian had limped from the fray. Hope is still being pinned upon Wes Morgan featuring for the first time since the match against Sevilla in mid-March.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jamie Vardy celebrates scoring for Leicester. Photograph: John Sibley/Action Image via Reuters\n\n“It looked better yesterday,” said the City manager of his absent captain, who has been suffering from back trouble since the last-16 tie. “He trained with the group for the whole session on Friday, and I hope he joins in with the rest of the group again on Sunday. It’s a big ask for him because it’s a difficult injury to get over, in terms of power and spring for a centre-back. But we’ll give him every opportunity and, with the medical staff, we’ll see what their feelings are.”\n\nAt least Benalouane should be fit, for all that he was traumatised at times by Benteke’s power in the air. It was the Belgian who had leapt above the centre-back to meet the excellent Andros Townsend’s delivery and power home Palace’s equaliser, though City were outraged the goal was not disallowed with the forward “riding”, according to Shakespeare, on the defender’s back.\n\nStoke City’s Xherdan Shaqiri stuns Hull City with touch of brilliance Read more\n\nThat completed the comeback sparked by Yohan Cabaye’s finish, the Frenchman perfectly placed to meet the loose ball after Jeffrey Schlupp’s shot had deflected off Danny Simpson. “Psychologically the players are in a far better place now than when I first arrived,” said Allardyce. “A player’s brain has to be functioning in the correct manner for his ability and skills to flourish. Our mental strength has increased in our decision-making process, and our fitness with it. Our quality, belief and determination have come shining through. Results are proving that now.”\n\nYet they had been forced to rally from a two-goal deficit here, Leicester having eased into an authoritative lead with a display that evoked last season’s triumphs. Huth’s early header from Fuchs’s throw-in had set the tone, the German rising above Joel Ward while Milivojevic dithered. “We’d practised defending against that here on the pitch yesterday,” said Allardyce, “but the players forgot. It’s that simple. They weren’t anywhere near where we put them, sadly, which is why he ran in with a free header and scored.”\n\nThe visitors’ second was just as trademark, with Townsend’s corner cleared out of City’s penalty area for Riyad Mahrez, holding off Zaha, to claim and liberate Jamie Vardy. The striker scuttled into the home half, tormenting Schlupp, a former team-mate, before cutting inside the full-back and curling his finish, via Wayne Hennessey’s fingertips, into the far corner.

The Everton midfielder responded to a traumatic period with an influential show against Burnley as Ronald Koeman’s team climbed to fifth with an eighth consecutive home win. Goodison Park, if he did not realise it before, is Barkley’s sanctuary.\n\nThere was a standing ovation for the England international when he left the pitch in the final minute and pointedly, amid doubts over his future at the club, Barkley responded in kind. The 23-year-old absorbed the celebrations on the Gwladys Street after striking a decisive second goal against Sean Dyche’s unfortunate side – credited to Ben Mee after a deflection off the Burnley defender – and pointed to all four sides of the ground, other hand on crest, while being booked for standing on the advertising hoardings as he did so. Phil Jagielka, with his third goal in three games, and Romelu Lukaku, with his 24th league goal of the season, sandwiched Barkley’s intervention.\n\nEverton join Liverpool in banning Sun journalists over coverage Read more\n\nLukaku struck for the ninth successive game at Goodison – equalling a feat last achieved by the legendary William Ralph “Dixie” Dean in 1934 – but this was Barkley’s day. Along with everyone else in royal blue, he made a subdued start against Burnley. Ultimately, however, this was a resilient response to a week in which he was punched in a city centre bar and the subject of a disgraceful column by Kelvin MacKenzie that resulted in Everton following Liverpool’s lead and banning The Sun newspaper. MacKenzie’s slurs were forgotten as Everton and Burnley marked the 28th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster with a minute’s applause before kick-off.\n\n“I can understand his celebration because what happened last week had really a big impact on him,” said Koeman, who was also indebted to the midfielder for two goalline clearances. “He will learn from what happened. I did some stupid things myself when I was 19, 20, 21. If you learn from mistakes, that is good. He is a human being and the best way for him to forget what happened is to play football. He was focused on the football side for the rest of the week and this afternoon. He was one of many in the team who started not good and struggled to adapt to the way Burnley played. They were the better team. It took us 30 minutes and after [that] I saw the Everton I like to see. It is a good win.”\n\nPlay Video 1:13 Ross Barkley will learn and move on, says Ronald Koeman after Everton win – video\n\nBurnley were initially the brighter, more aggressive side but their failure to capitalise on several defensive errors by Everton – two undercooked back passes from Jagielka and a dropped catch by Joel Robles – provided one explanation for their inability to win away from Turf Moor this season. They fell behind when Ashley Williams flicked on a Kevin Mirallas corner and Jagielka converted with a flying header that Tom Heaton clawed away, but too late. Goalline technology helped the referee, Mark Clattenburg, to make his decision before Jagielka had a second attempt from the rebound. The veteran defender celebrated with a cartwheel that demonstrated why 34-year-old men rarely perform them.\n\nTottenham keep pressure on Chelsea with hammering of Bournemouth Read more\n\nEverton’s lead was short-lived. Koeman was livid with Morgan Schneiderlin for losing possession in central midfield and his goalkeeper when, after Jeff Hendrick’s pass had sent Sam Vokes away from goal, Robles fouled the striker from behind to concede an idiotic penalty. “A stupid foul by the goalkeeper,” Koeman said. Vokes converted with ease.\n\nBurnley had a platform for victory but, once Everton stepped up a level, they had no response. Barkley’s shot found the far corner of Heaton’s goal via deflections off Michael Keane and Mee before Lukaku sealed victory in style, rolling Keane inside the area and finishing instinctively inside the near post. Leighton Baines’s ball into the striker made him the first defender in the Premier League to reach 50 assists.\n\n“I’m disappointed with the result but not the performance,” said Dyche, understandably. “That type of performance has to win you a game away from home eventually.”"}, {"date": "15/04/2017", "arena": "Bet365 Stadium", "attendance": 27505, "home_team": {"name": "Stoke

for goal of the season as any lingering relegation worries were eased.\n\nHull’s revival coupled with Stoke’s collapse had left the sides six points apart at the start of this game. Mark Hughes assured everyone there was no sense of panic, though there must have been a degree of concern when Hull came back from a goal down and began looking for a winner in the second half.\n\nHughes knows he has quality to call upon, even if the consistency is infuriating, and after sending on Jon Walters and Peter Crouch to restore the lead the home side were able to clinch an important victory with a sensational finish from Xherdan Shaqiri.\n\nHull will have to look for the points they need for survival at home, but they probably knew that anyway. If they continue playing as enterprisingly as this they have a decent chance. “The big difference was finishing,” Marco Silva said. “Stoke took their chances, we need to improve our final pass and make better decisions.”\n\nLate Fabio Borini goal earns Sunderland draw with West Ham Read more\n\nThe Hull manager also accepted his side began poorly, allowing Stoke to get off to an ideal start. Shaqiri set up Marko Arnautovic with a perfectly weighted pass that fully exposed the space between visiting defenders, and after stepping inside Michael Dawson and holding off Harry Maguire the striker confidently beat Eldin Jakupovic with a shot into the top corner.\n\nThe same player could have doubled Stoke’s lead three minutes later from another Shaqiri invitation, reading the chipped pass well but sending a right-foot volley over the bar. By the time Shaqiri had seen a shot of his own blocked from an Erik Pieters cross and Arnautovic had gone close again when he should really have hit the target from Glen Johnson’s pass, Hull seemed in danger of being passed to death.\n\nYet there is not as much between these sides as might be imagined. Although opened up a few times at the back, Hull kept coming forward with some stylish passing of their own. Maguire’s distribution was particularly eye-catching, Lazar Markovic and Kamil Grosicki were willing runners on the flanks and one pass from Alfred N’Diaye towards the end of the first half might have brought an equaliser, but for Grosicki electing to cross rather than shoot. With Oumar Niasse failing to connect from close range midway through the half and a Markovic volley bringing a save from Lee Grant the sides could easily have turned round level.\n\nSix minutes into the second half Hull were back on terms, thanks to a scruffy but nonetheless deserved goal from Maguire. When Pieters rather needlessly conceded a corner Sam Clucas and Grosicki worked it short and from the former’s eventual cross Maguire was able to force home via a deflection.\n\nChristian Benteke goal seals comeback as Crystal Palace draw with Leicester Read more\n\nHughes’s response was to send on the tried and trusted. The switch nearly paid immediate dividends as Walters brought a fine save from Jakupovic and Crouch was close to reaching the rebound, but Hull wasted an even better opportunity at the other end when Pieters was involved in a mix-up with his own goalkeeper and Niasse snatched at his shot.\n\nThe game was evenly poised at this point and even Stoke fans might have conceded Hull deserved something for their efforts, but the visitors ended up undone by the old firm. Walters popped up on the left with time to send over a precision cross to the obvious target waiting in the middle and Crouch rose high above Andrea Ranocchia to steer a well-placed header beyond Jakupovic’s dive.\n\nWith the pressure removed, Shaqiri sent the crowd home happy with the sort of goal few other players can score. Perhaps Andrew Robertson could have been a little quicker in closing him down, though there is not much anyone can do about a magic left foot. Shaqiri looked up and found the target from well outside the area, the accuracy, power and dip of his shot leaving Jakupovic no chance.\n\n“Shaq is all pace and strength but he’s a technician as well,” Hughes said admiringly. “It was a fantastic goal.”"}, {"date": "15/04/2017", "arena": "Stadium of Light", "attendance": 40168, "home_team": {"name": "Sunderland", "lineup": [{"name": "Jordan

An improved performance eventually drew most of the sting from the early, and vehement, calls for his head that rained down from the stands. That said a point is far from sufficient to rescue the division’s basement team from relegation.\n\nAt least they recovered from an opening so desperate that it took 35 seconds for Lee Cattermole to be booked for fouling Andre Ayew and five minutes for West Ham to score. When Javier Manquillo generously offered the advancing Sam Byram acres of space down the visiting right, his deep cross found Andy Carroll.\n\nNo matter that Carroll’s slightly miscued cross-shot hardly represented his finest moment, the ball fell for Ayew to place a shot just inside the post.\n\nSoon afterwards the ground echoed to chants of “We want Moyes out”. It was the first hint of such rebellion this season and felt significant, but the mutinous mood mellowed into an uneasy truce when Khazri equalised, thereby scoring Sunderland’s first goal in eight games.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A frustrated Slaven Bilic during the game. Photograph: Ian MacNicol/Getty Images\n\nPersistently, and puzzlingly, sidelined by Moyes this season, the gifted Tunisia winger returned to an interesting, somewhat politically freighted team-sheet with Lamine Koné – theoretically Sunderland’s best defender and a West Ham transfer target – dropped to the bench.\n\nKhazri takes a mean set piece and having won a corner courtesy of a clever run he took it himself, applying such extreme whip and curl to the ball that it evaded all comers before arcing over the wrong-footed Randolph en route to the bottom corner. “Are you watching David Moyes,” chorused the home fans, knowingly.\n\nAs skilful as that leveller was, West Ham could have done with having a defender at the far post. Khazri, starting a League match for the first time since October, has previously said that he likes to shoot from corners.”\n\nAnxious to remind everyone he also takes a decent set piece, Robert Snodgrass whipped a corner in with that wonderful left foot of his and, having dodged Jason Denayer, James Collins rose to power a header past Jordan Pickford.\n\nChristian Benteke goal seals comeback as Crystal Palace draw with Leicester Read more\n\nUndeterred, Khazri kept producing sufficient pleasing cameos to beg the question as to why Moyes – booed by sections of the crowd during journeys out of his dug-out – had consigned him to the deep freeze for so long. The Scot keeps lamenting the lack of quality in his squad but the winger positively oozes with the stuff.\n\nBilly Jones remains industry personified but Sunderland’s right-back received a nasty bang on the head for his ball chasing efforts here and required lengthy treatment on the pitch before being taken off on a stretcher, wearing a neck brace and oxygen mask. Happily, he was soon sitting up and talking lucidly before a trip to hospital for precautionary checks. He was later discharged.\n\nHis replacement, Fabio Borini, scored with his first touch, rifling in a shot after Randolph misjudged Darron Gibson’s cross.

They host Stoke at the Liberty Stadium and Clement, the Swansea manager, feels his side need to win that match after Mark Hughes’s side beat 17th-placed Hull to keep the gap at two points. He said: “With five games to go we are more than likely going to need to win three of those, and who will know if even that will be enough? I believe we can win three out of five games, we have won four out of six. It is an absolute must-win against Stoke.\n\n“Hull haven’t won so that is a bonus but also a missed opportunity, as if we had got the result we would have got out of the bottom three.”\n\nClement was unhappy with Mawson’s error and said the 23-year-old was feeling the pain of costing his side at least a point. “He’s very disappointed,” he said. “He knows he made a big mistake and we hope he won’t do that ever again.\n\n“Overall defensively in the game we were OK. It is clear what happened with the goal. It was an individual error and it came at a bad time. It is not something you expect from your central defender in that area of the pitch.\n\n“It was a better performance than last week at West Ham, more spirit and confidence in the players but not the quality where it was needed.\n\n“When you have gone six games and you have picked up one point, confidence can be affected and has been affected, but we have to deal with that.”\n\nStoke City’s Xherdan Shaqiri stuns Hull City with touch of brilliance Read more\n\nThings had started brightly for Swansea here though, with Heurelho Gomes making a smart save from Gylfi Sigurdsson.

The Belgian broke Southampton’s resistance by powering a header into the net 10 minutes into the second half, setting the stage for a City win that was embellished by late goals from Leroy Sané and Sergio Agüero.\n\nThe victory lifted City to third in the Premier League and widened the buffer zone between them and Manchester United, who are fifth but are, according to Guardiola, capable of gatecrashing the top four.\n\nThe Catalan said that Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur are uncatchable but that any two out of City, United, Liverpool and Arsenal could claim the other qualification spots for next season’s Champions League. After the weekend’s FA Cup semi-final, City host the Manchester derby, which their manager billed as “the real final”.\n\n“Until [City’s] last game at Watford the qualification for the Champions League will be so tough,” said Guardiola. “Two teams are already done and there are four top teams for two positions – Tottenham is so strong, they are not going to drop points. Thursday week we play the real final against United. That’s why it was so important to win [at Southampton] and for our confidence for the semi-final of the FA Cup.”\n\nFailing to challenge for the league title or the Champions League might be grudgingly accepted in Guardiola’s first campaign but dropping out of the top four would be much harder to bear even in a season of transition – especially if City were to be replaced by their neighbours in red. Losing points at St Mary’s would have been infuriating for Guardiola. Slack finishing briefly made it seem likely.\n\nAgüero frittered away two chances in the first five minutes. The first came courtesy of a lovely cross from the left by Gaël Clichy. Agüero showed dexterity to meet it, raising his right leg high like a ballerina before shooting like one, too. Moments later he was put clean through again but fired wide. It took the hosts 10 minutes to retort and then they, also, had cause to lament scruffy finishing. The move had been admirably neat, Nathan Redmond piercing City’s defence with a pass to Manolo Gabbiadini, who calmly cut it back to Dusan Tadic. The Serb’s shot landed in the upper reaches of the Northam Stand.\n\nMauricio Pochettino says ‘the world tried to kill Tottenham last season’ Read more\n\nThat Tadic had found such space in front of goal raised concerns about City’s defence, from which John Stones was absent due to an unspecified injury that Guardiola suggested was not too serious. The concerns about City’s defence turned out not to be serious here either, as Kompany and Nicolás Otamendi restricted the hosts to few openings after Tadic’s miss.\n\nCity still struggled to score, however. David Silva shooting into the side-netting from close range after a dinked cross by Agüero.\n\nIn the second half City raised the tempo. Fraser Forster had to excel to tip over a ferocious long-range shot by Jesús Navas. Kompany ensured that merely delayed the breakthrough. From the resultant corner he outjumped Maya Yoshida and butted a header into the net from six yards.\n\nSané and Agüero then killed the contest by finishing a pair of deadly counterattacks, each one orchestrated by Kevin De Bruyne.\n\nThe breakthrough goal was Kompany’s first since August 2015 and came on only his fifth league appearance of another injury-afflicted campaign. He celebrated his goal like a man giving vent to more than a year’s worth of pent-up fury but otherwise he channelled his anger into a polished performance. That came as no surprise to Guardiola.\n\n“Manuel [Pellegrini] last season missed him a lot last season and we’ve missed him a lot [this season],” said Guardiola. “He’s a guy with the quality to win duels one against one ... And he helps us in defensive and offensive set pieces because he’s a real defender.”\n\nAsked whether Kompany will remain important in the future Guardiola replied: “There is no doubt about it.” But he then added that, of course, plenty of doubt remains. “The problem is when a guy is injured for two or three years, what can we do?\n\n“In the past two years he has had a lot of problems and of course this is only his third or fourth game of the season and that’s not too much – but we are so happy he has come back and hopefully we can take care and he will be fit until the end of the season.”\n\nSouthampton v Manchester City: Premier League – as it happened Read more"}, {"date": "10/04/2017", "arena": "Selhurst Park", "attendance": 25648, "home_team": {"name": "Crystal Palace",

It was a display so feeble that the only consolation for Arsène Wenger was that the delirious din whipped up by the majority at the final whistle served to drown out the poison being directed at the visiting players from the away section. Only a handful dared approach that seething mass of frustration in the corner of the Arthur Wait stand. Even those few who did were dismissed as unworthy.\n\nArsène Wenger left wincing after Arsenal wave the white flag at Crystal Palace | David Hytner Read more\n\nParticipation in next season’s Champions League looks a pipe-dream now for Arsenal who remain seven points behind fourth place and utterly rudderless. It is just about excusable to labour in contests against elite opposition, as they have so often, but they were thrashed here by Crystal Palace. Local delight at the triumph was born less of a first home win against these opponents since 1979, when Terry Venables was in charge and this team wore a sash, but more of the victory taking the hosts further from the relegation places.\n\nThat damned Arsenal in itself but, while Palace’s momentum will surely carry them clear of trouble, Wenger’s team are in a tailspin. A dismissal of West Ham last midweek had merely papered over gaping cracks. This side have now conceded three goals in each of their last four away games in the top flight – Wenger had never previously lost that many in succession – and, in truth, were fortunate to ship only that many here. It was as if they never recovered from a tardy arrival at the ground 45 minutes before kick-off. They began flustered and rarely offered even a hint of composure thereafter. Alexis Sánchez was holding his head in his hands long before the end, a pose which is becoming excruciatingly familiar, while Wenger merely looked forlorn. Something surely needs to change.\n\nIt has at Palace. Sam Allardyce’s rejuvenation of this team is almost complete with his impact on this squad demonstrated here in their breathless energy, snarling aggression and bite in forward areas which shamed the visitors. Mamadou Sakho was a colossus once again, inspiring those across a back-line who must have been braced for Sánchez, Olivier Giroud or Mesut Özil to dazzle as they so often have in this arena. But, in truth, none of that trio, nor Theo Walcott or Danny Welbeck for that matter, were permitted to prosper while the hosts snapped at them, forever disrupting rhythm on the approach. That harrying was even more devastating at the other end where the visitors’ fragility was exposed from the off.\n\nPalace might have scored twice prior to edging ahead. Arsenal’s rearguard, denied Laurent Koscielny, was rendered ramshackle as opponents tore at them eagerly. “The whole emphasis on the players’ ability to shut them down, crowd them out of their fluent play, was the key to our success,” said Allardyce. The spaces that gaped were duly exploited by the lung-bursting running of Andros Townsend and Wilfried Zaha, or clever manouevring of Yohan Cabaye and Jason Puncheon. Christian Benteke tormented Shkodran Mustafi in the air and it was invariably a Palace player who gathered the knockdown.\n\nPlay Video 1:52 Arsène Wenger laments Arsenal's capitulation at Crystal Palace – video\n\n“We were full of energy, full of fight, full of belief and full of talent in the end,” added a manager who, eight days previously, had overseen a victory at the division’s runaway leaders, Chelsea. “It’s been one hell of a week for me and everyone at Crystal Palace.”\n\nArsenal, wheezing at the brutality of it all, never really threatened to recover from that early bruising inflicted by Benteke. It was the Belgian who had flicked on just after the quarter-hour to spread the panic, Cabaye and Townsend exchanging neat passes on the edge of the visitors’ box before easing the ball wide for Zaha. The winger actually seemed to slip as he squared into the six-yard box but no Arsenal player reacted and Townsend was unmarked to convert.\n\nArsène Wenger defiant despite Arsenal’s ‘damaging’ defeat at Crystal Palace Read more\n\nThe former Tottenham Hotspur winger would win a penalty from the panicked Emiliano Martínez’s lunge before the end, again from a Benteke flick which Arsenal could not repel. The excellent Luka Milivojevic thumped in his reward from the spot, prompting an ashen-faced Wenger to sink further into his trench coat on the Arsenal bench.\n\nHis team were still reeling from shipping a second moments earlier, a goal born of Townsend scrapping for possession at a throw-in and then sending Zaha free beyond a befuddled Nacho Monreal. The Ivorian sprinted into space and, rather than sliding a cross for Benteke, pulled his latest assist back to Cabaye at the top of the box. The Frenchman’s finish was clipped first time, arcing over Martínez and in. He had not scored here since 2015 and he has never delivered reward this sumptuous in a Palace shirt.\n\nThe first choruses of “You’re not fit to wear the shirt” had been bellowed from the travelling support in the aftermath of those goals, the tone becoming more spiteful while the visitors mounted late pressure which meant nothing and yielded less. This whole display had been shambolic, a humiliation to endure in a corner of the capital where this club have tended to thrive. Walcott’s post-match apology will have fallen on deaf ears.

Black Cats as José Mourinho’s players sustained their hopes of a top-four finish.\n\nAfter the final whistle sounded Ibrahimovic decided he was not really a run-of-the-mill mortal after all, informing an interviewer that he “felt like Benjamin Button” the fictional character who, living life in reverse, became younger rather than older. How Sunderland’s manager must wish he could turn the clock back and erase those unfortunate comments he directed at the BBC’s Vicki Sparks last month. Instead he is contemplating an imminent Football Association sanction while also facing the looming reality of Championship football after this deconstruction by the club who sacked him three years ago.\n\nJosé Mourinho says Manchester United will keep fighting for top-four finish Read more\n\nTen points adrift of 17th place, the Wearside club’s cause appears increasingly hopeless following 90 minutes in which they created little more than half-chances and were severely hampered by Seb Larsson’s highly controversial sending-off just before half-time.\n\nWhether that red card changed the destination of the three points is doubtful. Sunderland were already losing thanks to Ibrahimovic’s opener on a day when, not for the first time, the Swede’s magnetic presence masked the reality that prolonged parts of United’s overall performance were actually a little stodgy.\n\nTheir team-sheet had made interesting reading. There was no David de Gea, who was either slightly injured or dropped depending on whom one believed – Marouane Fellaini was captain, Marcus Rashford initially warmed the bench and Luke Shaw started at left-back.\n\nAfter being the subject – or should that be victim? – of a distinctly dubious bout of man-management on Mourinho’s part in midweek, Shaw began in such hyper-mode it seemed as if he must have had a caffeine overdose. He always appeared to be on the ball and it smacked of a player desperate to impress, never more so than when he was shown a yellow card for ploughing through the back of the similarly lively Didier Ndong. Across in the dugout Mourinho pulled a face.\n\nSubplots aside, it was a resolutely downbeat opening which seemed somehow out of keeping with the unusually warm Wearside sunshine but perhaps this sluggishness was only to be expected from two sides who have been heavily over-dependent on ageing strikers this season. Just as it is not Jermain Defoe’s fault that Sunderland are floundering so badly, neither is Ibrahimovic to blame for United’s struggles to finish in the top four.\n\nManchester United’s Ibra-dependence masks José Mourinho’s safe approach | Michael Cox Read more\n\nMeeting Ander Herrera’s pass, he emphasised the point by swivelling imperiously and, having turned Billy Jones while simultaneously wrong-footing Lamine Koné, shaping a wonderfully precise shot beyond Jordan Pickford and into the bottom corner.\n\nIt was his 28th goal of the season and left Pickford, who had earlier reacted superbly to turn Jesse Lingard’s shot away for a corner, helpless. If one had expected no less from United’s self-styled lion, Defoe was finding the going somewhat tougher. Watched by Gareth Southgate, the recently recalled England striker’s most notable first-half moment involved tracking back and winning a tackle against Shaw.\n\nAt half-time Defoe and friends were lucky not to be two down – Fellaini could not quite force Shaw’s fine cross past Pickford – but arguably unfortunate to be reduced to 10 men following Larsson’s sending-off for a slightly high challenge on Herrera as he followed through after a tackle.\n\nLarsson got the ball, many referees would have shown a yellow card and most people in the stadium were outraged by the decision. Conversely the referee would presumably argue that the height of the midfielder’s foot made it potentially dangerous and officials have a responsibility to minimise the risk of injuries similar to that recently suffered by Ireland’s Séamus Coleman.\n\nAfter initially being reluctant to depart, Larsson gave Mike Jones, the fourth official, an earful as he finally trudged off, leaving Ellis Short, Sunderland’s watching owner, looking extremely pensive.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sebastian Larsson attempts to plead his case as the referee Craig Pawson reaches for his red card after a foul by the Sunderland man on Manchester United’s Ander Herrera. Photograph: Stu Forster/Getty Images\n\nBarely a minute into the second half Short’s misery deepened when the excellent Henrikh Mkhitaryan received possession on the edge of the penalty area before threading a low, left-foot shot through Koné’s legs and into the bottom corner. Moyes’s players – now without a goal in seven games – had paid for their negligence in failing to close down United.\n\nShortly afterwards Shaw, who played very well, was withdrawn. Presumably well aware of the cameras zooming in, Mourinho made a big show of intercepting and embracing the young defender as he passed through the technical area. By then Paul Pogba’s volley had skimmed Pickford’s bar and, despite continuing to create the odd half-chance, Sunderland’s shoulders indicated by their slump there would be only one outcome.\n\nIt seemed a good moment for Mourinho to introduce Rashford’s pace and improvisation. It was a switch vindicated when, in the 89th minute, the teenager accelerated seamlessly on to Ibrahimovic’s pass and directed a low shot into the bottom corner, his first Premier League goal since

over for Craig Shakespeare but he will not dwell on a first defeat in charge of Leicester City, only the lessons. The interim manager was unable to equal Pep Guardiola and Carlo Ancelotti in winning his first six Premier League matches as Everton won a seventh home game in succession. Emulating the duo’s achievements in the Champions League would be ample compensation.\n\nLeicester may have lost an important Premier League game and momentum in the lead-up to the Champions League quarter‑final first leg at Atlético Madrid on Wednesday but there was little evidence at Goodison of a side losing their way. Shakespeare rang the changes ahead of the club’s historic date in the Spanish capital but the team’s focus and counterattacking strategy remained steadfast throughout an absorbing game. There will be concern at the champions’ defending without Wes Morgan, who Shakespeare confirmed will miss the first leg with an ongoing back problem, and the lapses in concentration from his replacement Yohan Benalouane. But better to be exposed and learn at Goodison instead of the Calderón.\n\nZlatan Ibrahimovic helps Manchester United stroll past poor Sunderland Read more\n\n“I don’t think we will lose momentum because of this,” Shakespeare said. “Footballers are resilient and these players are resilient. I told them afterwards that we have been on a really good run and now we have to go on another. We came up against a potent threat in Everton. They have some very good players but two set plays was the most disappointing thing. They have won the game on that.”\n\nCommitment to attack, defensive inexperience, errors and a sprinkling of quality made for a richly entertaining contest in which Romelu Lukaku and Ross Barkley responded impressively to the criticism their performances at Anfield last weekend had invited. Lukaku struck his 22nd and 23rd league goals of the season while Barkley delivered a decisive moment of class.\n\n“We speak a lot about Romelu and Ross because they are really important players who can make the difference between Everton and the opponent as they did today,” said Ronald Koeman, who reiterated his stance on the pair’s respective contract situations. “They are different – Rom has two years and Ross has one year remaining. We have offered Ross a new contract and so there are two possibilities. One is to sign the contract and if he doesn’t sign we need to sell the player. It’s simple.”\n\nIt was another homegrown midfielder, Tom Davies, who set the tone for a first half where the lead changed hands three times by scoring the quickest Premier League goal of the season on 29 seconds. Kevin Mirallas surged beyond Daniel Amartey and Benalouane before being pulled down by Danny Simpson’s replacement at right‑back. The referee, Robert Madley, played an intelligent advantage as Davies took over, shifted the ball on to his left foot and beat Kasper Schmeichel at the near post. Madley’s role was not overlooked by Morgan Schneiderlin, who congratulated the match official during Everton’s celebrations. They did not last long.\n\nLeicester’s changes included bench duties for Riyad Mahrez and Simpson plus a day off for Christian Fuchs, Shinji Okazaki and Wilfred Ndidi but their potency on the counterattack remained. Only four minutes had elapsed when the impressive Demarai Gray surged upfield. A more seasoned right-back than Mason Holgate would have taken a yellow card for the team by tripping Gray but he ran through to release Islam Slimani on the right. The unmarked striker finished expertly under Joel Robles.\n\nKoeman was down to the bare bones defensively with Séamus Coleman and Ramiro Funes Mori out with long-term injuries and Ashley Williams suspended, and inexperience cost Everton again when Leicester took the lead through Marc Albrighton. Matthew Pennington conceded a cheap free‑kick having turned into Jamie Vardy and trouble when a first‑time clearance was required. Albrighton curled his delivery from the left over the unreliable Robles and into the top right‑hand corner.\n\nHolgate and Pennington overcame their early jitters to provide valuable contributions to a home display that was elevated by the craft and industry of Lukaku and Barkley plus the fit-again Schneiderlin. “Morgan played a really clever role in front of the centre-halves,” said Koeman.\n\nGoodison was treated to a fourth goal with 23 minutes on the clock as Everton levelled in style. The central midfield trio of Schneiderlin, Davies and Idrissa Gana Gueye worked the ball out to Barkley on the right, who whipped a glorious cross behind Leicester’s defence for Lukaku to head home. It was a sixth assist of the calender year for Barkley and the eighth consecutive game in which Lukaku had scored at Goodison – the first time an Everton striker has accomplished the feat since Fred Pickering in 1965.\n\nBarkley looked certain to restore Everton’s lead when put through on goal by Davies’s challenge on Vardy. The midfielder rounded Schmeichel and struck for goal, only for the Leicester keeper to get the slightest touch on the shot and steer it wide. Barkley looked on in disbelief but, from the resulting corner by Mirallas the captain, Phil Jagielka, climbed highest and headed his second goal of the week into Schmeichel’s top corner. Another Mirallas corner, another Jagielka touch and more weak defending at a set-piece enabled Lukaku to lash home Everton’s fourth in the second half.\n\nThe Leicester substitutes Mahrez and Leonardo Ulloa twice combined to threaten late on but Gueye and Robles respectively blocked the striker’s headers to ensure their winning sequence was ended.

The wing-back Kieran Trippier was the man of the match but you would have to say that Son was exceptional, seemingly involved in every facet of Spurs’ manoeuvres.\n\nIf there was a team Pochettino could have handpicked to keep up momentum it had to be Watford.\n\n“Patience, time and a little bit of luck,” the Argentinian said of what Tottenham need now. “The most important thing is the next game, step by step. We have to be focused next week for Bournemouth and we have to prepare.\n\n“All the staff know it is important to build and believe in the fight for the Premier League. We are working a lot from day one and there is a lot of work to do but it is exciting here at this football club. It’s good for us, we are talking about building a winning mentality. That was a good opportunity for the future to keep pushing and believing and respect the way you play.\n\n“I am happy for Kieran, he deserved his reward. From the beginning it was a tough game, it was exciting, the players were very motivated to play and we started to control and dominate. We deserved the three points.”\n\nKane has made a remarkable recovery from an ankle ligament injury in just a few weeks. And with Tottenham on cruise control – they were 3-0 up at half-time – Pochettino decided to bring back the England striker, with match practice in mind, not only for the finale but also the FA Cup semi-final against Chelsea on 22 April. Kane could have capped his return with a goal only to hit the bar from a free-kick right at the end of a routine victory against injury-hit opponents.\n\nWatford had started with some industry, Stefano Okaka foraging in the absence of the benched Troy Deeney. However, once Alli opened up matters with a marvellously sweet strike into the top corner from range in the 33rd minute, the game took on a straightforward dimension for Spurs.\n\nSix minutes later Dier added another, a fizzing shot beating the Watford goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes.\n\nThe waves kept rolling and Son’s low shot from 25 yards just before half-time was augmented 11 minutes into the second half by a well-controlled side-footed finish from eight yards, from Trippier’s winding cross from the right. The stylish Dane Christian Eriksen had started the move.\n\nWatford are safe from any immediate relegation danger but, despite winning their previous two games, they were outclassed. Walter Mazzarri had to cope with several absentees and had said that he was, essentially, without a defence.\n\nThe Italian was full of praise for the victors, saying: “They were phenomenal. They have great players and they have great technique and physical condition. If we had more luck we could have made life more difficult.\n\n“Unfortunately in the first half when you are losing 3-0, the second half makes things difficult. We started well but they had three great shots from champion players and managed to score all three. In Italy they say they this cuts your legs completely.\n\n“If we look at what happened I am convinced we could have done better but we are doing well in the Premier League. We have to consider the injuries we had.”\n\nCruelly, all this hope may kill Tottenham – but not quite yet, at least."}, {"date": "08/04/2017", "arena": "Etihad Stadium", "attendance": 54393,

emphatic victory, with the winger staying out wide to find space on the right after the interval, where his pace swiftly provided the penetration that had previously been lacking.\n\nSterling kept coming inside in the first half, performing so anonymously that he was in danger of being upstaged by the contribution of Jesús Navas joining the attack behind him. But for an own goal the home side might not have turned round in front, yet any Hull hopes of getting back into the game were quickly extinguished when Sterling began to make his presence felt.\n\nRoberto Firmino caps Liverpool’s rapid turnaround against Stoke City Read more\n\n“Our second goal was beautiful, a good example of what we would like the team to be,” Pep Guardiola said. “I like everyone to be involved. The goal we conceded was more like what we want to forget. Six players forgot to defend properly and normally when that happens a goal is scored.”\n\nIt was easy to see what Guardiola meant about his side needing to be more clinical. City could have been a goal up inside five minutes but for a double save from Eldin Jakupovic denying first David Silva and then Leroy Sané. For much of the first half Yaya Touré was the home side’s most effective attacker, curling a shot over the bar, heading wide from a corner and bringing a fingertip save from Jakupovic from a free-kick.\n\nYet the truth was more that City were not creating many clear chances. Sergio Agüero was well looked after and rarely found himself on the end of attacks, Sterling and Sané offered little in the way of width and Hull were coping quite well until Ahmed Elmohamady’s error handed their opponents the lead.\n\nPlaying at right-back, Navas had his hands full trying to keep Kamil Grosicki quiet, but still found time to be a greater threat than Sterling down the wing. Crucially, when Silva sent him on a wide overlap he managed to get a decent cross in for a change. While Agüero could not quite reach it his attempt distracted Elmohamady at the far post, unless the defender had any other excuse for a far too casual attempt at a clearance that resulted only in a prod past his own goalkeeper.\n\nThe home side raised their game from the beginning of the second half, and were rewarded with a goal within three minutes of the restart. A patient passing move, with virtually every member of the team touching the ball, ended with a purposeful run from Sterling that took him past Andrea Ranocchia and into the area. Neither Michael Dawson nor Elmohamady could cut out his cross and though it fell behind Agüero the striker had time enough to pull the ball back and force a shot through the defenders on the line.\n\nAnother burst from Sterling almost produced a third goal within seconds. This time Dawson did succeed in reaching the ball, only to stab it goalwards, and it took a fine reaction save from Jakupovic to prevent a second own goal.\n\nCheikhou Kouyaté hits only goal as West Ham United sink Swansea City Read more\n\nHull could not really complain. Though holding their own in midfield they had not managed to test Claudio Bravo by the time they went two down, which, given the recalled Chilean’s shot-stopping statistics, has got to be regarded as a missed opportunity.\n\nMarco Silva sent on Abel Hernández and Markus Henriksen in an attempt to beef up his attack, though by the time Fabian Delph scored a spectacular third the visitors’ cause was lost. Sterling was once again involved, skipping away from Dawson down the right and ignoring Agüero’s calls for the ball in favour of a square pass to Delph, who took a couple of touches before lashing a glorious left-foot drive past Jakupovic from the edge of the area.\n\nRanocchia managed a consolation goal for the visitors with Hull’s first shot on target five minutes from the end. Bravo may have been partially unsighted but should have done better than merely getting a weak hand to the ball to maintain his dire record of being beaten almost every time by the first shot he faces.\n\nHull will doubtless wish they had been more adventurous earlier but they have never won a league match at Manchester City and have picked up five away points all season. If they are going to survive it is likely to be through points picked up at home.\n\n“We are in a big fight but our home form is amazing,” Silva said. “It is impossible to make any long-term plans, everything has to be about remaining in the Premier League this season.”"}, {"date": "08/04/2017", "arena": "Riverside Stadium", "attendance": 29547, "home_team": {"name": "Middlesbrough", "lineup":

warm spring sunshine dictated that Middlesbrough treated fans to a pre-match funfair in the club carpark. Complete with bouncy castle, carousel, live music and food it made for a carefree atmosphere only mildly tarnished by the cautionary presence of an adjacent fleet of ambulances and an NHS health bus. By the final whistle, though, it was Steve Agnew and his Boro players who seemed most in need of oxygen as their failure to beat a Burnley side without an away league victory this season nudged them a step nearer relegation.\n\nCheikhou Kouyaté hits only goal as West Ham United sink Swansea City Read more\n\nMathematically all is far from lost but the Teessiders have not won a league game since December and, despite adopting a much more direct, attacking approach, this was the 16th match in which they had failed to score this term.\n\n“Boro threw caution to the wind but we did enough to get the clean sheet,” said Sean Dyche, whose Burnley team are in effect safe, leaving Agnew deeply envious. “It was a game we should have won, we could have won and, of course it’s a missed opportunity,” said Aitor Karanka’s interim successor. “We’re six points adrift of safety but we’ve got a game in hand so I’m still positive.”\n\nAgnew certainly cannot be accused of failing to press every available tactical button; he has played a different formation in each of his four games in charge, with 3-5-2 used here. Ben Gibson, AKA the left-sided component of that defensive trinity, found himself scrutinised by Gareth Southgate, the former Boro manager turned England head coach who was in attendance.\n\nWith Burnley pressing assiduously, Gibson and co were soon under pressure and looked on anxiously as Robbie Brady’s early free-kick brushed the bar.\n\nIf Stewart Downing offered Boro real width from left wing-back while Rudy Gestede succeeded in persistently ruffling Michael Keane and friends in Dyche’s backline, the Teessiders’ final balls were far too easily second guessed. Significantly, Tom Heaton was rarely called to arms.\n\nBurnley generally proved well marshalled by Joey Barton’s midfield promptings and threatened sporadically on the break. Had George Boyd displayed a little more composure when an inviting shooting chance fell at his feet they could easily have assumed a first-half lead. Although Boro improved in the second period, they needed to speed up their passing; for all their virtues, Adam Forshaw and Grant Leadbitter are prone to dwell in possession when releasing the ball fractionally earlier might damage opponents.\n\nSensing a lifeline slipping away, Agnew introduced Álvaro Negredo. Almost immediately Downing’s clever trick and brilliant cross led to Heaton finally being stretched to the absolute limit to keep the Valencia loanee’s scissor-kick out.\n\nOn came Adama Traoré – startlingly sporting peroxide blond hair – to swiftly deliver a stellar cross into Adam Clayton’s path but, in a moment that seemed horribly emblematic of Boro’s plight, the midfielder shot tamely at Heaton. The sight of Sam Vokes failing to make the most of a similar opening at the other end possibly persuaded Agnew to play his final card, namely liberating Patrick Bamford from the bench.\n\nBoro’s forgotten man after being placed in deep freeze by Karanka, Bamford swiftly assumed centre stage, surging on to a splendid through-ball before being brought down by Keane – the last man and another defender feeling the heat of Southgate’s gaze – on the edge of the area.\n\nContentiously – extremely so – Keane received merely a yellow rather than a red card before Downing’s free-kick was deflected away by Matthew Lowton. The ensuing corner led to Dani Ayala’s header being clear off the line, with Lowton once again Burnley’s saviour. Negredo then had an effort rightly disallowed for handball. As the teams trudged off, the pitch remained bathed in sunlight but an ominous haze clouding the view of the Cleveland Hills hinted at gloomy days ahead."}, {"date": "08/04/2017", "arena": "Bet365

It was Coutinho’s neat finish that brought Liverpool level and two minutes later Firmino scored a goal of the highest quality to put Klopp’s team ahead, raising questions about whether either of the Brazilians could have started.\n\nKlopp addressed the issue afterwards, making it clear that playing either from the beginning would have been too big a risk, and acknowledged the contribution of Mignolet, who made two excellent saves at critical times. The first prevented Charlie Adam from doubling Stoke’s lead early in the second half and the second, coming just after Firmino had thumped a bouncing ball over the head of Lee Grant, was a candidate for save of the season, the Belgian scrambling across his line to deny Saido Berahino.\n\n“We needed Simon Mignolet, he made two outstanding saves,” Klopp said. “The second one was the best I’ve ever seen. The save of the day, the month, the year – well-deserved for him. He’s had a lot of criticism in his Liverpool career, so to show this … sometimes these are the moments you need as a player.”\n\nRaheem Sterling inspires Manchester City to victory over Hull City Read more\n\nAs for Coutinho and Firmino, Klopp justified his decision to leave them out of his starting XI by pointing to the figures he had received from Liverpool’s sports science department, saying: “This was the moment when each alarm clock was ringing for both.” Ideally he would not have played them for longer than half an hour but that plan went out of the window at half-time.\n\n“I had a difficult decision to make because it was not clear Roberto and Phil would be ready for 45 minutes,” Klopp said. “After the last game, Roberto, who is a guy who usually never says anything about how he feels, said: ‘I’m really done.’ It was clear that if we tried to bring him through 90 minutes it would cause us real problems. Phil lost three kilos in the last few days [owing to illness]. At the hotel this morning he said he was fine but we knew he would have low energy levels.”\n\nThe entire Liverpool team looked flat in the first half and Klopp’s disappointment at conceding just before the interval was compounded by the fact he felt Mike Dean, the referee, should have given the visitors a penalty moments earlier when Erik Pieters hacked at Woodburn’s heels.\n\nDean waved play on and Xherdan Shaqiri broke away on the left, skipped around Ragnar Klavan, who was playing on the left of a three-man central defence, and delivered an inch-perfect cross for the unmarked Walters to head home from inside the six-yard box. Adam should have scored from a similar position early in the second half but Mignolet managed to smother his shot and the significance of that moment would soon become clear.\n\nJordy Clasie breaks duck as Southampton close gap on West Brom Read more\n\nLiverpool had started to attack with more conviction and it was no surprise when Coutinho steered the ball into the bottom corner from 10 yards out to equalise. Stoke were still reeling two minutes later when Georginio Wijnaldum’s lofted pass from deep invited Firmino to run beyond the Stoke defence. The Brazilian let the ball bounce once before striking a wonderful 25-yard shot that flashed over Grant.\n\nStoke could – and probably should – have salvaged something from the match but Mignolet made that breathtaking save to deny Berahino, condemning Mark Hughes’s side to a fourth successive defeat and leaving the manager to reflect on what might have been. “We needed to take our chances and capitalise when we were on top,” he said."}, {"date": "08/04/2017", "arena": "The Hawthorns", "attendance": 24697, "home_team": {"name": "West Bromwich Albion", "lineup": [{"name": "Ben Foster",

"report": "Claude Puel says Southampton’s win can give them a perfect platform to end the season. Jordy Clasie’s first Premier League goal earned back-to-back league wins to edge the Saints four points behind West Brom, who are eighth and have now won once in their last six games.\n\nThe visitors, who have two games in hand on West Brom, were indebted to their goalkeeper, Fraser Forster, for a fine reaction stop he produced to deny Craig Dawson an equaliser in injury time.\n\nPuel is looking ahead to the final seven games following Clasie’s first-half winner. “We will see in the future but it was important to take this result, to keep a good ambition for the end of the season,” he says. “The spirit and attitude of the players was perfect,” said Puel, with Southampton ninth. “Now it’s important to keep this regularly and we will see against [Manchester] City for the next game.\n\n“It’s a great challenge but it’s important to keep this confidence for this game. We lost our first game against this team at home so it was important to take a little revenge but that was not the most important thing.”\n\nSaints were comfortable for long spells but needed Forster to secure the points when he clawed away Dawson’s six-yard volley before saving from Jonny Evans a minute later.\n\nPuel said: “It was fantastic for Fraser to finish the game with a clean sheet. We made a fantastic first half with quality in many situations and many opportunities but without the second goal.\n\n“I am happy for the team because it showed quality in the first half and character in the second half with Fraser.”\n\nIt was a forgettable game where the Baggies lacked the necessary quality to break their opponents down as Salomón Rondón, the Venezuela forward, who has not scored since December, was also thwarted by Forster in the first half.\n\nThe defeat was Albion’s second on the spin after Tuesday’s 2-0 defeat at Watford as they strive to reach 50 points for the first time in the Premier League. Their manager, Tony Pulis, said: “We’ve got to hit the target and be more clinical in front of goal.\n\n“Southampton are a good side but in the last 20 to 25 minutes we really took over the game. That’s when you need that little bit of composure to put the ball in the back of the net. There are lots of areas I’m going to look at in the summer, there’s no way in a million years that I’m going to criticise this group of players.”\n\nThe Saints clung on to their slender lead as the home side pressed in the latter stages – James McClean’s penalty appeals were waved away – but could not find a way through thanks to Forster’s saves in stoppage time.\n\nFirst, Dawson was not tracked as he latched on to Jake Livermore’s lofted pass but Forster pulled off a brilliant one-handed reaction stop to beat away the defender’s close-range effort.\n\nA minute later, the England goalkeeper turned Evans’s late header away to seal victory.\n\nCheikhou Kouyaté hits only goal as West Ham United sink Swansea City Read more"}, {"date": "08/04/2017", "arena": "London Stadium", "attendance":

over could have blown over the Orbit sculpture just outside. But for Slaven Bilic this win, which established an eight-point gap between West Ham and the bottom three, does not mean the threat of relegation has been completely dismissed.\n\n“There’s still work to do,” said the Hammers manager after a performance that was a long way from pretty but a result that was absolutely necessary. “We opened the gap a bit more, but we opened the gap a bit more a few months ago then we lost five in a row. Four more points is the minimum we need. Forty points is normally enough.”\n\nWest Ham are probably safe now, but Bilic pointed to another side who thought they were safe as an example of how quickly things can change. “You see PSG v Barcelona,” said Bilic, referring to the Champions League tie in which Barcelona scored three times after the 88th minute to knock the French side out. “We are talking about players who’ve won European Cups, World Cups, but when they lose confidence they went out.” No chickens are being counted here.\n\nSwansea’s position, still in the bottom three, is more perilous. As their manager, Paul Clement, said, their best news of the day came from elsewhere, with Middlesbrough drawing and Hull losing to Manchester City.\n\n“There was a lot of fear in our play – I can’t sit here and make excuses for that. It wasn’t good enough,” said Clement, pointing to the physically and psychologically draining late defeat to Tottenham as a possible cause for today’s struggles. “We put in a massive shift on Wednesday and there was a lot of heartbreak at the end of the game.”\n\nA Cheikhou Kouyaté goal just before half-time was enough to snag the three points for West Ham, though it was a game that virtually nobody could have enjoyed. Not the home team, who had to suffer horrific tension, not the away team, who lost, and not neutrals, who were hardly provided with an afternoon of rip-roaring entertainment.\n\nThe opening stages were played as if both teams had been challenged not to make moves of anything over three or four passes at a time – a bit like a large-scale and very expensive version of the Crystal Maze, only with less skill and in less atmospheric surroundings.\n\nJordy Clasie breaks duck as Southampton close gap on West Brom Read more\n\nThe first real moment of any quality came from the Swansea keeper, Lukasz Fabianski, who, while falling back into his own goal managed to somehow contort his body in such a way as to stop a Robert Snodgrass header from going past him. The home fans, desperate for some – any – good news, pleaded for the referee’s watch to buzz with conformation that the ball had crossed the line, but play continued.\n\nAfter about half an hour Clement looked at his own watch. Maybe he was bored. Fabianski produced another decent save to stop André Ayew’s low shot, but the general level of quality remained low, to put it kindly. This looked like a game between two sides struggling at the grim end of the table with the prospect of relegation looming. Which perhaps should have been no particular surprise.\n\nWest Ham took the lead just before half-time after a neat passing interchange – one of the first of the afternoon – fed Kouyaté outside the area, and his powerful shot dipped into the bottom corner. The midfielder dashed into the waiting arms of the home fans, who hugged him tightly: for this spontaneous expression of relief and joy he was, of course, booked.\n\nRaheem Sterling inspires Manchester City to victory over Hull City Read more\n\nHaving the lead didn’t seem to calm Bilic’s nerves. He limped around the London Stadium’s vast technical area, hands on hips, pausing only occasionally to move the hands to his knees and double over like a man with chronic stomach cramps. “It is not a time to panic or make kneejerk decisions,” wrote the co-owner David Sullivan in his programme notes. “We have 100% faith in Slaven Bilic’s ability to lead West Ham United forward.” That reassurance had not seemed to relax the Hammers manager.\n\nAs time ticked down Swansea inched their way into the game, missing a couple of presentable chances, while at the other end Ayew and Jonathan Calleri could have made things less tense.

They had marched on to the pitch with the sound of Tottenham’s heavy boot steps clanging in their ears, along with Conte’s order not to be spooked. Any Chelsea player unnerved by Spurs’ pursuit might also have harboured concerns about Bournemouth’s home form.

The Brazilian was grateful for the sharp reflexes of Thibaut Courtois, who batted the ball to safety.\n\nVictor Moses’s return from injury meant Conte could field his first-choice lineup and Moses soon launched Chelsea’s first attack. His cross from the right led to a blocked shot by Marcos Alonso. The Nigeria international tried again in the 17th minute, collecting a long pass by David Luiz before cutting in from his wing to zip a low pass to Costa, who spun past his marker and shot from 12 yards. It was a wonky effort that threatened to embarrass the striker until it took a benevolent deflection off Smith and made its way to the net. Luck like that works wonders against jitters.\n\nRaheem Sterling inspires Manchester City to victory over Hull City Read more\n\nSoon Chelsea swaggered farther ahead and flukiness was not a factor. N’Golo Kanté dissected the home defence with a pass from deep and Eden Hazard skedaddled into the box, duped Boruc into prostrating himself in front of him and then sidestepped the goalkeeper and slotted home. You could almost hear the groans from north London.\n\nThere were louder groans from the home crowd in the 29th minute when Charlie Daniels raced behind Moses and crossed for Benik Afobe, whose shot from 12 yards beat Courtois but cannoned out off the post.\n\nBournemouth though are too strong-minded to lapse into fatalism. They continued working to turn things in their favour and were rewarded just before half-time when King’s shot from 20 yards took a nick off David Luiz and flew into the top corner. Chelsea had food for thought to go with their half-time oranges.\n\nThey emerged for the second period in game-management mode, again intent on softening the home side’s bite by hogging the ball. Bournemouth are tenacious and when they finally regained possession in the 50th minute they immediately tried to sink their teeth into Chelsea. A fast-flowing move finished with Fraser firing just wide.\n\nCosta should have restored Chelsea’s two-goal lead shortly after that but failed to profit from six yards after Alonso teed him up for a tap-in.\n\nThat attack was a sign Chelsea were back in control and this time they did not look like relinquishing it. From then on Bournemouth were allowed to do nothing more than scamper gamely after Conte’s side as the visitors took command.\n\nChelsea started to make their dominance look effortless to the point of imperiousness. Alonso confirmed that impression in the 68th minute by curling a sumptuous free-kick over a six-man wall and into the top corner. In theory there was enough time for a comeback but Chelsea played the game out with an authority that made that seem an impossibility."}, {"date": "05/04/2017", "arena": "Emirates Stadium",

least Arsène Wenger and in these fragile times, it was one that the club’s directors could greet with relief. For them, it was exhibit A in the case for continuity.\n\n‘Not as easy as it looks’ could be Wenger preparing Arsenal fans for the worst | Paul Wilson Read more\n\nArsenal edged back up into fifth place and after the nervy but fortifying home draw against Manchester City on Sunday, this was a powerhouse performance – albeit against a disappointing West Ham United team who have now lost five in a row. Slaven Bilic was the manager who departed with the weight of the world on his shoulders.\n\nIt was an evening when Mesut Özil made the difference. At last. The playmaker scored his first goal since 10 December with a curling shot into the far corner and he also laid on the second for Theo Walcott. The substitute, Olivier Giroud, bent a sweet finish beyond Darren Randolph for the third and following the full-time whistle, a group of Arsenal fans could be heard to chant Wenger’s name. It was an occasion for the Wenger In brigade to clear their throats.\n\nÖzil has suffered more than any Arsenal player in recent weeks and Wenger said he had been “hit hard” by the Champions League exit against Bayern Munich. “It took some time for him to recover mentally,” the manager added.\n\nÖzil was on his game here, probing to unlock a deep-sitting West Ham defence. Crucially he caught a break. Randolph was unnerved by the presence of Alexis Sánchez in front of him after Özil had wafted in his shot and the West Ham goalkeeper could only help it into the net. It was a bad moment for him – as Bilic acknowledged afterwards. “It was a stoppable shot,” he said. Sánchez looked to have been offside but the replays showed he had timed his run to perfection.\n\nIt was as if a switch had been flicked in Özil and shortly afterwards he darted on to Sánchez’s back-heeled return pass to pull back the inviting cross for Walcott to score his 19th goal of the season.\n\nWest Ham had started well. They were compact and they snapped into tackles. There were even a couple of attacking flickers. Manuel Lanzini sent a dipping free-kick over the crossbar and Mark Noble shot past the far post.\n\nBut that was it until the game was beyond them. Emi Martínez, the third-choice Arsenal goalkeeper who played because of injuries to Petr Cech and David Ospina, was not extended until the 75th minute, when he reacted to beat away Lanzini’s fizzing drive. He showed clean handling to save from the substitute, Edmilson Fernandes, in stoppage time.\n\nWenger could enjoy the clean sheet – particularly, in the absence of the key defender, Laurent Koscielny – and his team’s superior technical quality told. They came to dominate the first-half but could not score. Danny Welbeck missed the clearest chance on 23 minutes when he fluffed a side-on volley following Sánchez’s dinked free-kick.\n\nWalcott felt he ought to have had a penalty in the 18th minute, when Arthur Masuaku checked him with his upper body but there was no decision from Martin Atkinson. The referee would ignore another strong Arsenal penalty appeal on 80 minutes when James Collins went into Nacho Monreal and a blatant one at the very end when Sam Byram caught Monreal.\n\nWest Ham put their bodies on the line. Héctor Bellerín had a shot blocked by José Fonte before half-time and Collins threw himself at Mohamed Elneny’s rebound while, after the interval, Collins jumped into a wonderful saving tackle on Özil.\n\nThere was niggle. Shkodran Mustafi argued that he was elbowed in the head by Andy Carroll in an aerial challenge while the Arsenal defender was guilty of a reckless lunge at the substitute, Robert Snodgrass, for which he was booked.\n\nArsenal might have had more in the second-half, with Randolph denying Welbeck at close quarters and Bellerín nudging just wide from Sánchez’s pass. West Ham were left to consider a must-win home game against Swansea City on Saturday. “We are in that fight now [at the bottom],” Bilic said. “It’s not being negative. It’s being realistic.”\n\nFor Wenger, there was a moment to reflect on the “world of extremes” in which he lives. “We are always praised too much when it goes well and criticised too much when it doesn’t,” he said. He was not complaining here."}, {"date": "05/04/2017", "arena": "KCOM Stadium", "attendance": 20380, "home_team": {"name": "Hull City", "lineup": [{"name": "Eldin Jakupovic", "yellows": [], "reds":

adventurous and exciting performance of Hull City’s season, a victory unlike many under Marco Silva and one that makes Middlesbrough’s task of retaining Premier League status appear grim.\n\nBoro have not won a league match since mid-December and now sit seven points behind Hull, albeit with a game in hand. For Silva’s side, though, there is renewed hope after Swansea’s late defeat to Tottenham, a result that pulls City out of the bottom three for the first time since October.\n\nIf they do achieve salvation this season, Hull’s home form will have been the key. Just a few months back and this stadium was echoing with chants against the owners, but Silva’s turning of the tide in such a short space of time has been a remarkable achievement.\n\nThe goals were spread across the team – coming from Lazar Markovic, Oumar Niasse, Abel Hernández and Harry Maguire – and although Boro were a more potent attacking force than in recent weeks, their first-half efforts from Álvaro Negredo and Marten de Roon papered over the cracks of a weak defensive display which frustrated the caretaker manager, Steve Agnew.\n\nSilva, the Hull head coach, said the performance was the finest since he joined the club. “I think it is our best game, we started fast with a good intensity. We controlled all the first half. We had a very good reaction [to their goal],” added the Portuguese.\n\n“It’s important, but nothing is finished tonight. It’s a big fight until the end of the season, I don’t doubt that. But [it’s good] when I look to the table and see our different position.”\n\nMiddlesbrough had not scored an away league goal this year before this crucial game and the five goals shared between the two sides in the first half – the most in any Premier League game this season – were therefore a shock to most inside the KCom Stadium.\n\nAlli, Son and Eriksen strike late to give Tottenham dramatic win at Swansea Read more\n\nIn the fifth minute neat interplay from Rudy Gestede and Negredo down the left was followed by a fine first-time through-ball from the Spaniard to Adama Traoré. The winger jinked into the penalty area and waited, with the chance seemingly gone, before scuffing a low shot towards the far post that the onrushing Negredo steered into an empty net.\n\nThe Hull equaliser nine minutes later was provided by Markovic, his first goal for the club since joining on loan from Liverpool, a simple prod home from inside the six-yard box after Niasse had headed a deflected cross towards goal and Hernández’s initial effort was blocked by Ben Gibson.\n\nThey looked a threat whenever they came forward and were ahead in the 27th minute through Niasse, demonstrating the kind of sharpness that has made him a key part of the Tigers’ recent renaissance by finishing swiftly following a flicked header by Hernández.\n\nSoon Hernández himself was on the scoresheet and Hull seemed in complete control. Maguire played a precise ball from deep to Kamil Grosicki and the Poland winger drove forward before squaring for the Uruguay striker to finish into a gaping net.\n\nEldin Jakupovic brilliantly tipped Gestede’s header onto the crossbar before Agnew’s side controversially pulled one back. Gibson helped on a corner and De Roon was clearly in an offside position when he nodded past Jakupovic but the goal was given after a consultation between the officials.\n\nBut Middlesbrough’s hopes were dashed with 20 minutes remaining and, yet again, their defending was poor. Andrew Robertson whipped in a deep free-kick from the left towards Maguire at the back post and with the Boro rearguard looking to play offside, the Hull defender ghosted in unmarked and nodded past Víctor Valdés.\n\nAgnew said: “That’s not like us to concede goals like we did. We didn’t get the balance right, in trying to win the game we became too open. We did give it a go, but we were far too open. Within the game, the disappointment was the goals we conceded. The goals weren’t just the [fault of] the backline. We conceded poor goals.\n\n“After the game it was silent and you’d expect that.

It should have been, ‘See the game out lads, terrific result after three points at Chelsea’, we should have had more responsibility as a team to make sure Southampton did not score.”\n\nAllardyce was just as livid with the assistant referee for his decision not to award a foul against Steven Davis, who robbed Wilfried Zaha on the byline in the buildup to Nathan Redmond’s equaliser just before half-time.\n\n“It is a diabolical decision that the assistant referee did not make on Zaha,” he said. “They are very difficult decisions sometimes they have to make but this was so easy and it cost us not being 1-0 up at half-time.”\n\nSouthampton, who came into this game with two wins from their past eight matches, were in no mood for any slip-ups. The troublesome penalty spot from which Bournemouth’s Harry Arter had spectacularly missed on Saturday, was re-laid with a patch of hybrid turf to ensure the surface was 100% firm. There were a couple of personnel changes too, with Shane Long preferred to Jay Rodriguez up front and Ryan Bertrand absent.\n\nLong was Southampton’s biggest culprit in front of goal, thrice guilty of missing from close range. The Saints could have had a penalty too, but the referee, Roger East, dismissed appeals of handball against Jeffrey Schlupp. Palace always looked a threat, with Benteke bullying Jack Stephens at times and Luka Milivojevic earlier rattling the outside of a stanchion on Fraser Forster’s goal.\n\nAlli, Son and Eriksen strike late to give Tottenham dramatic win at Swansea Read more\n\nSouthampton, though, kept pressing. Davis was denied by Mamadou Sakho and Damien Delaney but eventually Palace’s defence capsized, with Yoshida tapping home at the back post from Redmond’s cross and Ward-Prowse adding a simple third less than a minute later.\n\n“With all of the opportunities we could have scored many goals and we would have not been able to accept just a draw at the end,” said Southampton’s manager Claude Puel.\n\nA night that started so well got away from Palace, who also lost Yohan Cabaye to a calf strain. But it was the pain on Allardyce’s face at full-time that told the biggest story, with the Palace manager saying his team must “get a result” against Arsenal on Monday. “I think we have got the hardest run-in of all the teams down there and that is why we had to get a result tonight,” the manager added."}, {"date": "05/04/2017", "arena": "The Liberty Stadium", "attendance": 20855,

Swansea City as Dele Alli, Son Heung-min and Christian Eriksen struck late on at the Liberty Stadium.\n\nAlli deservedly cancelled out Wayne Routledge’s opener in the 88th minute and with the referee Jon Moss indicating seven minutes of added time, Son pounced on a Vincent Janssen flick to slot past Lukasz Fabianski and Eriksen sealed what could yet prove to be a vital three points as he waltzed through Swansea’s tired defence to score the third.\n\nEden Hazard outwits Manchester City to strengthen Chelsea’s title grip Read more\n\nUp to that point, it had been a night of frustration for Mauricio Pochettino’s men, but their dominance of this encounter meant they deserved to win. For Swansea, this was a bitter pill to swallow as they slipped back into the relegation zone.\n\nRoutledge’s first-half goal had given them hope but they were unable to hold on and the nature of this defeat could yet cause long-term damage to their top-flight survival hopes.\n\nFor Tottenham, it was a different story, and Pochettino’s celebrations at their late salvo said everything about the importance of this win.\n\n“We pushed hard in the last six minutes, Swansea were deeper, and we showed faith, belief and didn’t go away,” the Argentinian said. “From the touchline, you must behave and translate confidence and belief. The players deserve all the praise for this result.”\n\nLooking to keep pace with the leaders Chelsea, Tottenham lost their captain Hugo Lloris to illness before kick-off, Michel Vorm stepping in between the posts at late notice against his former club. The former Tottenham players Kyle Naughton, Tom Carroll, Gylfi Sigurdsson and Routledge all started for the home side, while the striker Fernando Llorente failed to brush off an ankle knock.\n\nIn Lloris’s absence, Tottenham conceded a poor early goal. A long pump forward from Fabianski found Jordan Ayew, who outpaced Ben Davies and crossed for Routledge to poke home from inside the six-yard box. Despite the goal, Swansea were on the back foot, but held firm in defence in the face of constant Tottenham pressure to reach half-time with their lead intact.\n\nThe second half started with claims for a penalty from either side. First, Ayew went down under a Toby Alderweireld challenge, and then Son appealed for handball after his shot was blocked by Federico Fernández. Moss waved away both appeals, but it took Tottenham, who reverted to a 3-4-3 formation at half-time, until the final 10 minutes to break through.\n\nMauricio Pochettino says Spurs showed champions’ mentality at Swansea Read more\n\nFabianski produced two wonder saves to deny the substitute Janssen and then Alli, with the first of those blocks leaving him injured and causing the long period of added time. It looked like Swansea were going to introduce their replacement goalkeeper Kristoffer Nordfeldt, but Fabianski insisted he was fit to stay on.\n\nMinutes later, Swansea were leaving the field with their tails between their legs. Hull’s win over Middlesbrough did the Welsh side no favours, either.\n\nClement said: “It’s a result that’s very tough to take for me, the players and the fans. We got off to a really good start, and the goal gave the team a lot of belief.\n\n“It’s heartbreaking we’ve come out with nothing. We have to be encouraged by our performance for long periods of the game. They put in a good physical effort and we have to be professional and go again on Saturday against West Ham.\n\n“The players know the situation, we’re in the bottom three, but we have to go there believing we can get a result.

The Italian spent most of the second half a frenzy of livid agitation on the edge of his technical area, frantically waving to his players and barking instructions or imploring the beleaguered fourth official, Bobby Madley, to offer plausible explanations for every tight decision. He is emotional at the best of times on the touchline, of course, but all his mannerisms were particularly exaggerated as time ebbed agonisingly from this contest.\n\nHe had stared in disbelief as John Stones went unnoticed just inside the six-yard box as Manchester City’s last corner of the contest veered into the penalty area, then puffed out his cheeks in relief as the centre-half’s awkward volley from in front of goal flew harmlessly over the bar. His own cheers were drowned amid the din at the final whistle seconds later. This victory squeezed the last breath of life from City’s vague challenge but, critically for Chelsea, also kept Tottenham Hotspur an arm’s length away. Spurs could mount their late rally in distant south Wales, but the seven-point lead is maintained. Everything about this win felt significant.\n\nAntonio Conte tells Chelsea to assume Tottenham will win all remaining games Read more\n\nIt was the kind that is secured by champions, not because the home side were at their scintillating best, despite Eden Hazard’s best efforts in establishing their lead before the interval. Rather, it was in the refusal to permit City an equaliser where Chelsea demonstrated their strength. This defence has been punctured too often of late, not least by lowly Crystal Palace at the weekend. Sergio Agüero’s equaliser here, converted into a gaping net after Thibaut Courtois had inexplicably cleared straight to David Silva, had ensured the leaders are still without a top-flight clean sheet since January. Yet they had still recovered their poise to edge back ahead, and then succeeded in containing the visitors’ late attempts to force parity.\n\nCity, as Pep Guardiola was keen to point out post-match, had enjoyed a fine 10-minute spell early on and had been by far the more authoritative of the two teams after the interval. The first six minutes of the second period had seen Fernandinho, on the turn, skying a volley over the bar and Vincent Kompany, on his first league start since November, looping a header on to the woodwork. Suddenly Leroy Sané and Agüero were menacing, Kevin De Bruyne more adventurous with his passes, and Silva threatening to orchestrate a revival as if these pedigree players had been reminded of their lofty reputations.\n\nYet the visitors’ increased threat actually coaxed the best from the home side. David Luiz roused himself, conjuring arguably his best performance of a fine campaign, while Gary Cahill and César Azpilicueta blocked, tackled and forced away everything flung at them. That familiar trio had actually been disrupted from the start, the Spaniard thrust into a role at right wing-back in Victor Moses’ absence, but Kurt Zouma’s toils against Sané had been relieved by his withdrawal at the break. This team sought safety in familiarity thereafter. “We had a better balance and defended very well,” said Conte through a whisper, his throat raw from the evening’s instruction and exhaustion setting in.\n\nEden Hazard’s brilliance lifts Chelsea as view from the Bridge improves | Barney Ronay Read more\n\nIt was the kind of defiant scrap the Italian would have relished in his playing days, his current charges heaving themselves to stifle City’s revival. Hazard, a match-winner with his two goals, conceded it was not always “beautiful” to behold but having experienced such a rare and untimely loss on Saturday, this was solely about recovery. His first-half rewards, the opener benefiting from a flick off Kompany’s head and Willy Caballero’s weak attempt to block with his right hand, would claim the points.\n\nChelsea’s second, plucked 10 minutes from the interval, stemmed from a penalty awarded for Fernandinho’s trip on Pedro, with Cesc Fàbregas’ slide-rule pass in the build-up a thing of beauty. Caballero had at least redeemed himself to a certain extent by blocking Hazard’s penalty, but the Belgian slid in the rebound while the goalkeeper was still prone on the turf. No one can match the 10 goals the winger has scored in this arena this term. “It was a big win,” he added. “We can do better than the way we played but after a defeat, it’s good to come back. Our target is clear.”\n\nSo is that of City. For all the exquisite nature of so much of their attacking play, and the periods of dominance they have enjoyed in both fixtures against the champions elect, Guardiola’s team lost both and are 14 points adrift, with qualification for the top four now their priority. The manager, while satisfied his team had performed “1,000 miles better” than in their draw with Arsenal on Sunday, put their failures in the head-to-head down to Chelsea being “better than us in the boxes”. He will address those issues in the summer and City will come back stronger. Just as Chelsea did here after their weekend blip.

This season’s other familiar flaw, struggling against teams in the bottom half of the table, had also reappeared to undermine Liverpool’s hold on a top-four finish.\n\n“We had to change Phil because he felt sick at half-time,” said the Liverpool manager. “He vomited then said he felt better but it was clear when he made the sign that he has to change. It’s no joy when you have to take off your best player.\n\n“We decided to organise a little differently, three at the back plus two in front with Lucas [Leiva] and Emre to give the full-backs opportunity to use the space on the wings. We could close the game in one moment, we didn’t, we left it open – second goal after a set-piece and then nearly vomit from me. That is not nice. We have to take it. It is my responsibility all of this. I have to be more clear to my players but we will find a solution.”\n\nLiverpool still had chances to win after King’s late leveller but Klavan headed straight at Artur Boruc from close range and Origi was unable to connect with Joël Matip’s flick towards the far post.\n\nMatip, shifted to the substitutes’ bench as a result of a back problem suffered against Everton on Saturday, was the man chosen to replace Coutinho as Klopp opted for insurance over adventure at 2-1. Bournemouth’s refusal to accept defeat has yielded four points against Liverpool this season but their manager insisted Klopp’s defensive switch was not a factor in their latest impressive recovery.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Divock Origi climbs highest to score Liverpool’s second goal. Photograph: Clive Brunskill/Getty Images\n\n“The game had changed and the scoreline was the more defining factor as we had to throw caution to the wind at the end,” said Howe, who instructed his tireless forwards, King and Benik Afobe, to drop deep and congest midfield whenever Liverpool had possession. “It was human instinct for Liverpool to sit back on what they had rather than anything tactical.”\n\nErrors undermined Liverpool’s victory prospects at the start and close of the contest. Before kick-off, with Kenny Dalglish on the Kop and Margaret Aspinall, chair of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, in the directors’ box, the club paid tribute to the 96 people who were unlawfully killed at Hillsborough in 1989, the survivors and the families, in their final home game before the 28th anniversary of the disaster. Anfield will no longer hold a memorial service on 15 April at the request of the families.\n\nLiverpool banned from signing academy players and fined £100,000 Read more\n\nOn the pitch, Georginio Wijnaldum gifted the visitors an early lead with a back pass under pressure from Arter straight to the lurking Afobe. The former Arsenal striker made no mistake and Mignolet had no chance of reaching Wijnaldum’s wildly optimistic pass.\n\nMarc Pugh should have doubled Bournemouth’s advantage but volleyed inches wide when found unmarked at a corner. A big miss, punished five minutes before half-time when Roberto Firmino released Coutinho with an exquisite pass into the penalty area and he beat Boruc with an expert finish from 12 yards. In the process, he equalled Juninho’s record as the Premier League’s highest scoring Brazilian.\n\nWijnaldum atoned for his error when he sold both Jack Wilshere and Adam Smith a dummy inside the Bournemouth area and floated a perfect cross on to the head of Origi, who made no mistake from four yards out.

Uncertainty had begun to creep into Sean Dyche’s team and their Premier League status following a worrying run of form but another home triumph, their 10th of the season, against Stoke City edged them closer to survival.\n\nGeorge Boyd’s instinctive finish was sufficient to punish Mark Hughes’s side, who have badly lost their way since December, and again put into focus the contrast that is keeping Burnley afloat in the top flight. Of their 35 points, a Premier League record for the club, 32 have been collected at Turf Moor and only the top three of Chelsea, Tottenham Hotspur and Liverpool have won more matches at home. Dyche could have designs on Europe if Burnley could replicate this form on their travels.\n\nZlatan Ibrahimovic’s late penalty rescues Manchester United against Everton Read more\n\n“If you’re a Burnley season ticket holder, then you are certainly getting your money’s worth,” he said. “I’ve lost chunks of my scalp scratching my head over why we haven’t won away this season but our performances at home have been fantastic. There has been a lot of noise about us going seven games without a win but five were away and the other two at home were against the top two so it has been difficult. We played well considering we were coming off the back of an awkward run but it was a goal worthy of winning the game.”\n\nThat was undoubtedly true and Burnley’s resistance when the substitute Peter Crouch led a late aerial assault was also impressive, although Hughes legitimately lamented the first-half profligacy that cost Stoke dearly. There was no shortage of attacking intent and commitment from both teams but a painful lack of quality in the final third helped explain their recent struggles.\n\nStoke, now with only four wins in 17 league games, created the better openings before half-time but Marko Arnautovic squandered two clear sights of Tom Heaton’s goal to leave his supporters aghast. Burnley needed the reprieves having slipped from 10th to 15th, and only five points above the relegation zone before kick-off, since their previous win, over Leicester City in January.\n\nArnautovic should have given Stoke the lead when a misplaced corner from Burnley enabled Charlie Adam and Saido Berahino to break on the counterattack. The Austria international was played clean through on goal by Berahino but a dreadful first touch gave the ball straight to Heaton. He was given a second bite on the stroke of half-time, again from a delightful Berahino touch, but attempted to pass back to the striker instead of shooting and wasted another opportunity.\n\nLeicester’s Islam Slimani and Jamie Vardy deepen Sunderland gloom Read more\n\nHughes said: “We should have converted at least one chance in the first half and that would have made things difficult for Burnley. Our performance was OK but we lacked the quality and guile to pick the right pass in the final third and when you don’t take those chances you are always susceptible.”\n\nThe second half began in similarly ominous, as well as comical, fashion when Adam attempted to take a corner, tripped on his approach, stumbled knee-first on to the ball and handled to concede a free-kick to Burnley. At least he and Hughes managed to see the funny side. Their smiles were removed, however, when the hosts produced a rare moment of quality to score.\n\nJeff Hendrick was the provider with an incisive run from central midfield into the Stoke penalty area beyond two weak challenges. The Republic of Ireland midfielder crossed low from the left and Boyd, from 12 yards out, swept a first-time shot beyond Lee Grant’s despairing dive. “It was a sublime finish and a great set-up from Jeff,” said Dyche."}, {"date": "04/04/2017", "arena": "The King Power Stadium", "attendance": 31757, "home_team": {"name": "Leicester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Kasper Schmeichel", "yellows": [],

suggesting he might slap a female reporter. Islam Slimani and Jamie Vardy scored to extend Leicester City’s winning run but, before that, Moyes’s employers pledged to allow him to continue trying to fight against relegation.\n\nSunderland declared on Tuesday that their manager’s remarks to the BBC’s Vicki Sparks had been “wholly unacceptable” but that no further action needed to be taken against the Scot, who has apologised both privately and publicly. The club noted in a statement that Moyes had “proactively” informed the club about his comments two weeks ago and said sorry to the reporter.\n\nThe Football Association, which has requested Moyes’s observations about the exchange, may decide that stiffer punishment is in order but Sunderland concluded that “the club continues to fully support David in his role as manager”.\n\nThe joshing, the slap-joke, the fallout: the Great Moyes Debate has begun | Marina Hyde Read more\n\nMoyes welcomed that statement and said it was nothing less than he expected. He also said he was “surprised in many ways” by the extent of the criticism of his criticism.\n\nThe club’s statement was no doubt intended to mitigate any reputational damage caused by what has been interpreted variously as an ill-judged quip or a sinister threat. It certainly did not have the side-effect of inspiring an improvement in Sunderland’s performances on the pitch, most of which have brought derision of another kind this season.\n\nAs Moyes and his players trudged away from the King Power Stadium after their latest failed assignment, they might have been struck by the contrast in moods around their club and Leicester.\n\nNearly six weeks on from the shock firing of Claudio Ranieri, the home of the champions is again at peace, albeit a delightfully noisy and giddy peace. Free beer and cakes were distributed to fans before kick-off to celebrate the birthday of Leicester’s chairman, Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, while the club’s manager, Craig Shakespeare, has progressed from feeling like a “pantomime villain” in his first press conference after Ranieri’s dismissal to a manager who can do no wrong. This victory brought his record to six wins from six matches. The champions are back in the top half of the Premier League.\n\nShakespeare had the pleasure of deploying the same lineup that had swatted away Stoke City on Saturday. Moyes, meanwhile, had the pleasure of calling on Lee Cattermole. Injury had kept Sunderland’s captain out of the team since September but here he was cast straight back into the side on a mission to stimulate renewed fight from a team that have seemed resigned to relegation. Sunderland, in fairness, did not lack gusto here. But they were nowhere near good enough to deserve any points.\n\nNeither team shone in a brisk but untidy first half. The visitors hinted at menace from several corners and a couple of long shots but Leicester came closest to scoring.\n\nJordan Pickford tipped a header by Robert Huth over the bar after a free‑kick by Riyad Mahrez. The goalkeeper excelled just before the break when he dived across goal to turn away a curling 20-yard shot by Demarai Gray.\n\nGray posed a regular threat. It hardly came as a surprise even to Moyes when Cattermole was booked for trying to sabotage a Leicester break by tripping the young winger in the 34th minute.\n\nMoyes saw no need to change approach at half-time, hopeful that his team could eke out a goal even if their top scorer, Jermain Defoe, had barely been involved in the first half.\n\nSunderland fans sensed an opportunity in the 54th minute when Sebastian Larsson lined up a free-kick at the edge of the Leicester box. Larsson disabused them of their optimism by nearly hitting them with his shot. Three minutes later another free-kick by Larsson led to Defoe’s first shot of the night. He struck it crisply but straight at Kasper Schmeichel.\n\nSunderland’s David Moyes surprised at level of criticism after ‘slap’ remark Read more\n\nShakespeare was concerned. Just after the hour he made a double substitution, introducing Slimani and Marc Albrighton. Soon that pair combined to open the scoring. Albrighton crossed from the left and Slimani outmanoeuvred the hitherto solid Lamine Koné before heading into the net from seven yards. Shakespeare’s changes had paid off.\n\nMoyes hoped to have a similar impact when he, too, made a double substitution in the 72nd minute, throwing on Wahbi Khazri and Victor Anichebe. The latter almost granted his manager’s wish but his shot from 15 yards was deflected on to a post. Then Vardy deepened Moyes’s misery. After more excellent work by Albrighton and more sloppy defending by Sunderland, Vardy walloped a shot into the net from 16 yards.\n\n“I thought we’d done a really good job up to 60 or 65 minutes but ultimately we allowed a cheap cross into the box and we should have won the header for the first goal,” said Moyes, who said a second defeat in four days left his team needing an improbable feat to avoid relegation. “We needed to win one of these two away games.

His 20-yard curler in the 13th minute set Watford on their way to a win that pushes them up to ninth and all but confirms their top-flight place for another season, even if Miguel Britos’s sending off with 25 minutes to play meant the game became more a struggle than a celebration.\n\nFor the first time this season the Hornets kept a clean sheet against a side in the top half of the division and, though the visitors created few clear chances, not many will be harder earned. The fiery atmosphere that settled over this match like a foul fog will be familiar to veterans of the teams’ first meeting of the season, at The Hawthorns in December, which Watford also finished with 10 men and a lengthy list of complaints and accusations, but on that occasion with no points.\n\nGeorge Boyd edges Burnley closer to survival with victory over Stoke Read more\n\nThe referee, Paul Tierney, was booed off at half-time after Craig Dawson’s studs-up challenge on José Holebas went unpunished and James McClean’s off-the-ball ankle swipe on the same player brought only a yellow card, both incidents coming in stoppage time. For much of the second period the match simmered with barely repressed aggression both on the pitch and the bench, where Walter Mazzarri had to be restrained as he rushed furiously at the fourth official after Jake Livermore tackled Niang from behind – again without punishment – in the 54th minute.\n\n“I was trying to speak to the fourth official and since on the other team their whole bench was speaking the whole time with the fourth official, in this game and in the first game on their ground, I thought I could do the same and someone on my bench said I shouldn’t,” the Italian said. “I told him to leave me alone. The rules should be the same for everyone.”\n\nTen minutes after that Britos, booked for a foul on Hal Robson-Kanu in the first half, gave the ball away in midfield and tugged Salomón Rondón’s shirt in the aftermath, and this time Tierney did act, setting up a breathless and merciless 30-minute barrage that the home side, with a combination of determination and desperation, withstood.\n\nDespite its breathless conclusion Niang’s contribution will be the abiding memory of the match. In the 13th minute Troy Deeney flicked Craig Cathcart’s long pass to Niang, who cut unopposed across the edge of the area before thumping the ball deliciously inside the far post. Watford continued to attack impressively, albeit creating few chances, until Niang’s impeccable first-time 50-yard curling through-ball in the 54th minute found Deeney racing between Jonny Evans and Allan Nyom. In desperation Evans flung out a foot, bringing the striker down and diverting the ball, only for it to bobble up invitingly for the striker to prod past the stranded Ben Foster. Mazzarri described the opening hour as “the best we have played this season” and “the football I would like to see all the time”, a wish his side’s fans would surely share.\n\nFor all that, West Brom might have taken the lead in the seventh minute when Robson-Kanu let Darren Fletcher’s pass run through to Nacer Chadli, who ran clear only to strike his first shot into the onrushing Heurelho Gomes and spear the rebound in the wrong direction from a yard. The same player missed their best chance of the second half as well, volleying wide of the near post after the ball had been chipped over the home defence. “I’m not going to criticise the players,” said Tony Pulis. “They gave it a right go tonight but just lacked a little bit of quality and a little bit of luck.”"}, {"date": "04/04/2017", "arena": "Old Trafford", "attendance": 75272,

going to come in handy if Manchester United continue playing like this. They have taken only two points from two successive home games and they needed a 94th-minute penalty to avoid defeat against a desperately unlucky Everton.\n\nThis was a classy and convincing response from the visitors after their abject display in the Merseyside derby, while once again questions were raised about the ponderousness of United’s attack. At this rate they are not going to instil much fear into Europa League opponents, though a certain amount of luck remains on Mourinho’s side, otherwise it would not have been Luke Shaw’s shot that brought about the last-minute spot-kick.\n\nJosé Mourinho criticises Manchester United’s finishing after Everton draw Read more\n\nAccording to Mourinho the left-back is not currently worth a place on the bench, never mind the pitch, but after coming on midway through the second half he was in position to pile on the pressure when the ball came his way with seconds to spare. His shot was low but on target, it hit the diving Ashley Williams on the arm rather than the head and Everton’s outstanding defender had to make the walk to the dressing room as Zlatan Ibrahimovic stroked in the penalty.\n\nThough Shaw made the bench for this game, in spite of managerial reservations, Wayne Rooney did not. After appearing for a mere 16 minutes against West Bromwich Albion, United’s erstwhile captain was omitted with what his manager described as “pain in both ankles”. Whatever interpretation one wishes to put on that it would appear the 31-year-old’s time at Old Trafford is drawing to a close, at a point when Ibrahimovic, already four years older, is claiming to be capable of carrying on for another two or three years.\n\n“I know the Premier League is begging me to stay,” the Swede told BT Sport before the game. “I came here at 35 and everybody thought I was in a wheelchair, but the lion is still alive.” Giving his opinions of the best strikers around in the Premier League Ibrahimovic mentioned Romelu Lukaku – “strong” – and Sergio Agüero – “good all round” – without mentioning himself. Modesty? Hardly. “Lions don’t compare themselves with humans,” he said, making a bid for the Eric Cantona award for talking the pith.\n\nLukaku had a quiet game against Liverpool last time out and had been invited by Ronald Koeman to show his worth against United, who in turn struggled without Ibrahimovic in the goalless draw against West Bromwich.\n\nIbrahimovic was the first to show up, powering through Mason Holgate’s challenge in the opening minutes and forcing Williams to come across with a covering block, before a run from Lukaku at the other end took him past Marcos Rojo to be stopped by an Eric Bailly tackle on the edge of the area.\n\nThese turned out to be mere preliminaries to Everton taking the lead in bizarre fashion midway through the first half. Kevin Mirallas had just brought the first save of the game with a shot from a narrow angle and, from the corner which David de Gea conceded, Williams sent a looping header vaguely goalwards. It was slightly awkward for Rojo to deal with, though there was still no apparent danger until, with his back to goal, Phil Jagielka stuck out a boot to reach the ball first and flick a shot through De Gea’s legs. If West Brom’s refusal to cross the half way line on Saturday irked Mourinho, the look on his face at the manner in which United fell behind suggested an even darker mood, though the United manager cannot have it both ways.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Phil Jagielka celebrates with Romelu Lukaku after putting Everton in front in the first half. Photograph: Jason Cairnduff/Reuters\n\nEverton did more than cross the halfway line; they moved the ball around and played with a confidence that had been absent at Anfield, and the opening goal was a reward for their spirit and adventure even if it came as a gift from a generous defence.\n\nIt was up to the home side to respond and they almost did on the half-hour when Joel Robles could not hold Daley Blind’s free-kick and Ander Herrera’s follow-up attempt skimmed the crossbar. Herrera brought another save from Robles before the interval but Everton also had their moments, particularly on the couple of occasions when Lukaku found himself able to run at Rojo.\n\nLeicester’s Islam Slimani and Jamie Vardy deepen Sunderland gloom Read more\n\nMourinho sent Paul Pogba on for Blind in the second half, a switch that necessitated all manner of recalculations in the United back line, though at least the substitute got involved quickly, heading against the bar from Ashley Young’s free-kick. There were predictable bookings for Gareth Barry and Ross Barkley as the game became a little overheated, with Young cautioned for the home side, and Mirallas was sensibly withdrawn before he could get into serious trouble.\n\nYoung was pulled for the same reason, though sending on Shaw in his place was surely Mourinho’s last desperate gamble. Ibrahimovic forced a close-range header past Robles from Herrera’s cross but was brought back for offside, then Marouane Fellaini had a chance to score against his old club but hit his shot high into the Stretford End. Everton remained tight at the back and in control, while United remained short of ideas. Lukaku might have made the game safe had he looked up and found Barkley after another surging run past Rojo near the end; instead he went for glory and saw his shot charged down by Bailly.\n\nShaw was not a conspicuous success until his moment arrived in stoppage time. Neither, it has to be said, was Ibrahimovic, who despite his rest was as slow and predictable as everyone else in red.\n\nThe self-proclaimed mane man put a last-minute header over the bar with a chance to rescue a point and would have been as relieved as anyone else when United gained a shot at redemption from the unlikeliest source."}, {"date": "02/04/2017", "arena": "The Liberty Stadium",

end this way. Neither Swansea City nor Middlesbrough had enough about them to pick up the victory they so badly needed, the result leaving both sides in grave danger in a Premier League relegation battle where the momentum lies with other clubs.\n\nCrystal Palace and Leicester City have both climbed clear of the bottom three in recent weeks and Hull City will fancy their chances of doing the same after this result. Marco Silva’s side are now only one point behind Swansea, whose revival under Paul Clement is threatening to run aground after taking only one point from their last three matches.\n\nFrustration was written all over Swansea faces at the final whistle, yet the damage could have been worse for the Welsh club had Rudy Gestede taken the chance that Álvaro Negredo expertly created for him in the second minute of injury time with a glorious pass with the outside of his boot. Gestede profligately headed wide and with that Middlesbrough’s hopes of snatching their first league win since the middle of December slipped through their fingers.\n\nClement admitted his heart was in his mouth at that stage but also made the point that it would have been “very harsh” on Swansea if they had come away with nothing. On the balance of play the Swansea manager was right in that respect, yet he also knows they need to show much more conviction in front of goal if they are to win this survival battle.\n\nGetting Fernando Llorente back on the pitch is vital. The Spaniard was ruled out with an ankle injury here and Swansea, quite simply, are not the same team without their leading goalscorer. So many crosses were delivered into the penalty area, from open play and set pieces, and it was hard not to think that Llorente would have got his head on the end of one of them had he been on the pitch.\n\n“I think you do miss him because he’s a big focal point,” Clement said. “But that’s not to say that Jordan Ayew didn’t play well, he gave us another dynamic that Fernando doesn’t have. But when you are crossing a lot of balls into the box, Llorente is a miss, of course.”\n\nThere is a chance that Llorente will be back for Tottenham Hotspur’s visit on Wednesday, although Clement did not sound overly confident. Middlesbrough go to Hull on the same night and surely must win that match if they are to have any chance of staying up. Steve Agnew’s side were resilient defensively against Swansea, as they have been for much of the season, but never offered enough as an attacking force. The fact they registered only one shot on target says it all.\n\nAdama Traoré looked dangerous every time he got on the ball – Leroy Fer and Alfie Mawson were both booked for desperate challenges on the winger as he tried to scamper clear – but Boro’s threat was sporadic. Traoré dragged a shot across goal early in the second half, Negredo and Stewart Downing both saw early efforts blocked and then there was that wonderful opportunity for Gestede, who replaced the injured Gastón Ramírez in the first half.\n\nGiven that Gestede had now gone 39 Premier League games without a win, going back to August 2015, he could be forgiven for lacking a bit of confidence. “Rudy is a terrific lad,” Agnew said. “He’s gone on and you have to remember he had a hamstring injury and came off, then he had a recurrence of that and came off, so he worked hard to be ready for today. He was up to the speed of the game, his movement was terrific and on another day, which could be Wednesday, he scores.”\n\nA breakthrough beckoned on a few occasions for Swansea. Tom Carroll’s 25-yard drive flashed inches wide in the first half, Gylfi Sigurdsson’s curling shot was arcing towards the top corner until Víctor Valdés stuck out a hand to make a superb save and in a frantic finale Mawson’s close‑range header was nodded clear and Fer was thwarted with some last‑ditch defending.\n\nMawson’s chance came after Sigurdsson’s 20-yard free-kick was deflected behind, with replays showing that the ball struck Adam Forshaw on the wrist. Not that there were any great Swansea appeals at the time.\n\nClement, rather curiously, decided not to make any substitutions, which seemed strange given that Swansea were crying out for some fresh impetus at times in the second half. He explained that he was worried about “unbalancing” the team, yet twisting rather than sticking may have been the best option at that point.\n\n“We’re disappointed because the objective was to win,” Clement said. “I think there was some nervousness in the stadium today from both sets of players and from the supporters, that’s normal. There’s a lot at stake at the moment, there’s a lot of pressure at the top and bottom. We have to deal with that. We’ve got eight more games now, lots of opportunities to pick up valuable points and why not on Wednesday night?”"}, {"date": "02/04/2017", "arena": "Emirates Stadium", "attendance": 60001, "home_team": {"name": "Arsenal", "lineup": [{"name": "David Ospina", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Hector Bellerin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shkodran Mustafi", "yellows": [61], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [53], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Laurent Koscielny", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Nacho Monreal", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Francis Coquelin", "yellows": [15], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Granit Xhaka", "yellows": [32], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Theo Walcott", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [40], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [68]}, {"name": "Mesut Özil", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alexis Sánchez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Welbeck", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [77]}], "subs": [{"name": "Kieran Gibbs", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gabriel Paulista", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Olivier Giroud", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [68], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex Iwobi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [77], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Emiliano Martinez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mohamed Elneny", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ainsley Maitland-Niles", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Manchester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Willy Caballero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jesus Navas", "yellows": [8], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Stones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nicolás Otamendi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gael Clichy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fernandinho", "yellows": [47], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin De Bruyne", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Raheem Sterling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "David Silva", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [89]}, {"name": "Leroy Sané", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [5], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sergio Agüero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [42], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Claudio Bravo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Vincent Kompany", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pablo Zabaleta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [89], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nolito", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aleksandar Kolarov", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fabian Delph", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yaya Touré", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Arsène Wenger has talked in recent weeks about personal reinvention while the buzz phrase coming out of Arsenal on Sundaywas “catalyst for change”. In short, as the chief executive, Ivan Gazidis, explained to a group of fans’ representatives in the morning, everyone at the club has to evolve in order to drive improvement – and that includes the manager.\n\nIt felt like a snappy piece of management-speak rather than any meaningful clue as to whether Wenger was going to remain in charge for the start of next season – with the feeling persisting that the directors want him to stay. It was followed by an Arsenal performance that took in several familiar themes. The Emirates crowd were edgy, the team were loose at the back and erratic in central midfield, while it was impossible to ignore the impression that disaster lurked around the corner.\n\nExcept that it did not. Manchester City were equally skittish and Pep Guardiola was unhappy at how his players took care of the ball – at least until Yaya Touré came on for the second half to bring a little more composure. They were also undermined, once again, by a failure to take their chances.\n\nCity were the more threatening team at 2-2 and they argued loudly for a penalty in stoppage time, when the Arsenal left‑back Nacho Monreal got himself into a tangle, misjudged a header and felt the ball hit an arm. Guardiola went on to the field at full-time to remonstrate with the referee, Andre Marriner, who, he noted, was the official who had denied Raheem Sterling a penalty in the 2-2 home draw with Tottenham in January.\n\nArsenal emerged with the draw and given their miserable recent run, it was easy for Wenger to feel not only relief but a measure of satisfaction. The performance might have been disjointed and there were further clashes between the Wenger In and Wenger Out factions of the support but, at least, the result served to check the negative spiral.\n\nIt had not looked too promising for them at the outset. Arsenal were riddled with nerves and they conceded an early goal that laid bare their fragility. Shkodran Mustafi had stepped up to execute a clearing header but he sent the ball straight to Kevin De Bruyne, who volleyed it first time back up the middle.\n\nIn the blink of an eye Leroy Sané had muscled on to it, with Héctor Bellerín on the wrong side and nobody in red covering. Where were the centre-backs? Sané is a beautifully balanced player and he made a difficult finish look routine, holding off Bellerín before going round David Ospina and rolling the ball into the empty net.\n\nAt the very outset, Fernandinho had played in Raheem Sterling only for Ospina to get out to clear and there was a backs‑to-the-wall feel for Arsenal by the 10th minute, when De Bruyne bent a shot against a post and David Silva worked Ospina with the rebound.\n\nWenger’s team got back into it without looking truly cohesive. Danny Welbeck had gone close in the early running and after Sané’s goal, Arsenal flickered through Mesut Özil and Alexis Sánchez. The first equaliser came when Arsenal botched a short-corner routine but the visitors botched their attempts to clear. Mustafi sent a header back into the area and it found Theo Walcott, who got the better of Gaël Clichy to prod past Willy Caballero. Walcott’s celebrations, and those of his team-mates, were muted.\n\nArsenal’s good feeling lasted 131 seconds. Actually, it was less than that because they fell apart almost immediately at the back and were grateful that De Bruyne could not finish when well placed.\n\nCity regained the lead with their next possession. Özil lost the ball and the ease with which the visitors cut through his team was remarkable. After an incision from De Bruyne, Silva worked it wide to Sergio Agüero, who had manoeuvred himself into yards of space, and he flashed a low shot into the far corner.\n\nThere was still time before the interval for Walcott to lift a half-chance over the crossbar from Sánchez’s set-up. It was a strange game and a curious atmosphere, with the Arsenal support fearing the worst when Laurent Koscielny did not reappear for the second half because of an Achilles problem.\n\nThere was also the moment on 50 minutes when Mustafi stepped out of defence with the ball only to overrun it and surrender possession in a dangerous area. Sánchez was next to Mustafi and he berated him before standing still as City surged into the area – on a move that would come to nothing. Sánchez had earlier tracked a run by De Bruyne and when he looked around, he noticed that he was the only Arsenal player to have chased back.\n\nCity continued to look threatening, Agüero fluffing a free header from Jesús Navas’s cross. Guardiola had started Navas – one of six out-and-out attackers in his lineup – at right-back, which felt risky against Sánchez. He did an excellent job.\n\nThe game twisted again when Mustafi leapt to glance a corner beyond Caballero but, thereafter, City were the better team. Fernandinho was denied by Ospina; Agüero worked the goalkeeper after some faffing by Sánchez; Francis Coquelin risked a second yellow card for a barge on De Bruyne and Monreal got away with his apparent handball. At last Wenger could feel he had caught a break."}, {"date": "01/04/2017", "arena": "Anfield", "attendance": 52920, "home_team": {"name": "Liverpool", "lineup": [{"name": "Simon Mignolet", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathaniel Clyne", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joel Matip", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dejan Lovren", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Milner", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Emre Can", "yellows": [68], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lucas Leiva", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Georginio Wijnaldum", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sadio Mané", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [8], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [57]}, {"name": "Roberto Firmino", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Philippe Coutinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [31], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [74]}], "subs": [{"name": "Loris Karius", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marko Grujic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ragnar Klavan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alberto Moreno", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Divock Origi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [60], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [57], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Woodburn", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Trent Alexander-Arnold", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [74], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Everton", "lineup": [{"name": "Joel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matthew Pennington", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [28], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [67]}, {"name": "Ashley Williams", "yellows": [62], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Jagielka", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mason Holgate", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Davies", "yellows": [26], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [66]}, {"name": "Idrissa Gueye", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leighton Baines", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ross Barkley", "yellows": [40], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Romelu Lukaku", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dominic Calvert-Lewin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [82]}], "subs": [{"name": "Arouna Kone", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin Mirallas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [82], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gareth Barry", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [67], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Enner Valencia", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [66], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Maarten Stekelenburg", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ademola Lookman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonjoe Kenny", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Liverpool kept up their top-four hopes with a second victory of the season over Everton, who were unable to rise to the occasion or even show much of a hint of their recent league form. The sides found themselves depleted after the international break, but in Matthew Pennington and Dominic Calvert-Lewin Everton threw in two players with barely a dozen appearances between them and no experience of Anfield. Liverpool were in control from the start and, truth to tell, won without having to be at their best. Everton still await their first win on this ground since the turn of the century.\n\nBoth managers said they were proud of their players’ efforts, even though Jürgen Klopp was obviously happier with the result than Ronald Koeman. Both thought their side had controlled the game, too, which clearly cannot have been the case, but Klopp was rightly enthusiastic about Liverpool’s finishing while Koeman accepted that the home side had the edge in quality and experience. “We had four boys aged 22 or less,” the Everton manager said. “I’m not afraid to put young players in, it is the only way they will gain experience, and they played in a way that I like to see Everton play.”\n\nKlopp paid a classy tribute to Séamus Coleman in his programme notes and though Everton were missing other players, notably Morgan Schneiderlin and Ramiro Funes Mori, it was the patched-up right side of the defence where the unlucky Irishman normally operates that Sadio Mané exploited to give Liverpool an early lead.\n\nAfter evading a Tom Davies challenge Mané carried the ball across the edge of the Everton area and Mason Holgate and Pennington managed to get in each other’s way in their attempts to close him down. The two defenders were also obscuring the view of Joel Robles, so that when Mané hit a crisp low shot through Pennington’s legs an unsighted goalkeeper was down too late to save it.\n\nRobles did rather better in preventing Philippe Coutinho extending Liverpool’s lead midway through the first half, leaping to get a strong hand to a goal-bound shot. Even then the ball looped up and over the goalkeeper and would have gone in but for Phil Jagielka tidying up on the line.\n\nLiverpool 3-1 Everton: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nEverton were not being overrun, they were holding their own in midfield without managing to set Romelu Lukaku or Ross Barkley free up front. The Liverpool defence was coping well enough with Everton’s limited attacking threat until the visitors equalised from a set piece, Pennington drilling home from close range for his first goal for the club after Jagielka had got his head to a Leighton Baines corner.\n\nThe Everton supporters tucked away in a corner of the Anfield Road end celebrated noisily, only to be silenced within a couple of minutes when Coutinho succeeded in what he had been trying to do earlier and sent a curling right-foot shot into Robles’s top corner. As soon as the Liverpool forward got away from Idrissa Gueye it was clear he was going to try his luck and though Pennington and Ashley Williams recognised his intention neither was able to get to him quickly enough.\n\nFor a Merseyside derby the first half was unusually open and entertaining, though two Everton players went into the book before the interval. Davies mistimed a challenge on Mané, while Barkley, who had already been spoken to for a foul on Emre Can, went over the top after showing too much of the ball to Dejan Lovren, catching the defender on the ankle when he had no chance of retaining possession.\n\nBarkley seemed in danger of allowing his frustration to get the better of him once again. He has previous against these opponents, though 22 men remained on the field and it was an innocuous looking collision between Baines and Mané that resulted in Liverpool having to make the first substitution. Mané hobbled off and Divock Origi came on, putting himself on the scoresheet with virtually his first touch. Such was the opportunity presented by the Everton defence, with Williams and Jagielka missing in the middle, that Origi could hardly miss. Invited to beat Robles from the edge of the area the substitute confidently did exactly that.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Kenny Dalglish watches from behind Gary McAllister, with Ian Rush in the row behind – and Daniel Craig wearing sunglasses. Photograph: Phil Noble/Reuters\n\nThere were further bookings for Williams and Can but with the result not in doubt the rest of the game passed off relatively peacefully. It might have been different had Everton pulled a goal back, but when Holgate had the opportunity from a Baines cross he headed tamely over. Lukaku might have done better, though the story of Everton’s afternoon was that Lukaku was hardly in the game.\n\nEverton can always rely on their neighbours to put any hint of a revival into perspective.

League title race.\n\nWithout their talisman Harry Kane, forced into two late first-half alterations, and with a goalless draw at one of the top flight’s toughest grounds beckoning, Pochettino ditched his usual interval routine of analysing the first-half highlights. Revamping a beleaguered Spurs and altering their system, he returned to the bench unusually early alongside his assistant Jesús Pérez, leaving his players to contemplate the task ahead.\n\nThe response to their adversity – Victor Wanyama was forced off with a back injury and Harry Winks taken off on a stretcher and given oxygen on the way to hospital after going over on his ankle – was stunning. With Eric Dier, who seamlessly switched from a position in the back three to one in front of the defensive line, and substitute Mousa Dembélé directing traffic, Tottenham’s monopoly on second-half possession paid rich dividends as Chelsea’s lead was cut to seven points with nine games remaining.\n\nFirst, Dier kept his composure to steer the ball home after Burnley failed to deal with a Christian Eriksen corner midway through it. Then, 11 minutes later, victory was sealed when Son Heung-min converted one of half a dozen other good chances in the final quarter, emerging at the far post to sidefoot in after Dele Alli tightrope-walked the offside line.\n\n“It was a massive three points for us to still believe and fight for the title,” said Pochettino. “It’s always difficult the first game after the international break but it was a very professional performance. We showed great belief, character and faith and that made me proud.”\n\nOf the interval intervention, he said: “It was a big hit for us, for the team, so it was very important when the players got in to switch on and change things. We changed formation. The team needed lifting. It was a very concerning moment but the reaction was really good.”\n\nTottenham, with a back three selected to combat Burnley’s physical threat down the middle that often became a five early on, struggled to create chances before the break.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Tottenham’s Harry Winks is taken off on stretcher. Photograph: Jason Cairnduff/Reuters\n\nWith Chelsea trailing to Crystal Palace, a muted anticipation pervaded the travelling support but all their team could create in the opening 45 minutes was a single opportunity for Alli. Having played a major role in a quicksilver counter from deep, he, arrived right on cue to seize upon the rebound after Tom Heaton parried Eriksen’s low cross, yet somehow lifted over the top with the goal at his mercy.\n\nWhen several others were squandered at the start of the second – Moussa Sissoko, another replacement, slashed wide when well-positioned and Heaton foiled Vincent Janssen and Ben Davies in quick succession – time was running out.\n\nChelsea stunned by resurgent Crystal Palace and Christian Benteke Read more\n\nBut Eriksen’s corner travelled to the back post and when Jeff Hendrick failed to clear, Dier controlled with his first touch and stroked in with his second.\n\nWith the game stretched opportunities came by the bucketload: Son hit the side-netting after Eriksen robbed Hendrick in midfield before anticipating Alli’s low centre 13 minutes from the end. Had Alli’s delightful dink put a finer sheen on the result there could have been few objections.\n\nWest Bromwich Albion frustrate Manchester United the Tony Pulis way Read more\n\nThe result also has significance at the other end of the table with Burnley – momentum stalled by hosting two of their past seven league fixtures – now five points outside the relegation zone.\n\nHowever, despite this and a failure to test Hugo Lloris in the Tottenham goal, their manager, Sean Dyche, remained buoyant: “We know we have been on a tough run.

Chelsea, untouchable for so long at the top and a side that had won 13 games in a row at home, succumbed here to a team who have spent almost the entire campaign choked in the grip of a relegation battle. For the second season in succession, this corner of the capital has been conquered by Crystal Palace. From nowhere, the first seeds of doubt may have crept into the leaders’ procession.\n\nThis was a far more eye-catching victory than last season’s success given its context, a team from the lower reaches having checked the Premier League’s previously irrepressible force. Even Palace’s staff and players appeared genuinely startled in the aftermath, Wilfried Zaha catching his breath after another performance to leave the Football Association privately cursing in regret to announce he was stunned.\n\nSam Allardyce marched into his post-match media conference to joke: “That shocked you all, didn’t it?” He added that with his players four points clear of the cut-off this was no time for celebration, though the din from the away dressing-room, the dance music interspersed with choruses of “Mamadou Sakho, Sakho, Sakho”, suggested otherwise.\n\nChelsea’s players, more sombre in a neighbouring room, will still be perplexed as to how they had run aground on the Liverpool loanee. Or had been denied so consistently and thrillingly by Wayne Hennessey, a player who has been much maligned throughout his Palace career but is suddenly in the form of his life.\n\nThe hosts’ had whipped up frantic pressure almost from the moment they fell behind in the 11th minute, but as the visitors refused to wilt desperation had rather set in. Too many centres were intercepted by Palace players, too many shots belted close enough for Hennessey to claim. Composure drained. Antonio Conte was left hopping in anguished frustration when Diego Costa met Eden Hazard’s cross on the edge of the six-yard cross, but with the goalkeeper resigned he steered a header wide.\n\nThe Italian has not been used to picking over losses since arriving in England last summer and looked utterly exhausted as he conducted his own assessment. He has been warning for months that the title is not yet Chelsea’s, with this perhaps a timely reminder to his players of the peculiar quirks of this race.\n\nTottenham Hotspur have trimmed the gap to seven points – still a relative chasm – but Manchester City are visitors on Wednesday. The recovery must be swift, the sense of alarm that infected much of their play exorcised immediately. Once they had taken time to review this occasion, Conte and his staff will take solace from their attacking vim and vigour, even if the opportunities had been fluffed.\n\nThey converted one of them, Cesc Fàbregas flicking in off the near-post early on from Hazard’s delivery, and must briefly have anticipated another stroll against a team near the foot. Palace had not conceded since mid-February but, as Allardyce had made clear, their game-plan was not built for a chase. That merely made the manner of their riposte all the more remarkable. Zaha, inevitably, sparked their rally, squeezing space from a dithering César Azpilicueta and Marcos Alonso just outside the penalty area before fizzing a low shot back across a startled Thibaut Courtois and into the far corner. The speed and accuracy of the shot appeared to take the goalkeeper by surprise. Zaha had no right to gain such power from a cramped position between opponents. It was as if Chelsea had not sensed the danger.\n\nThey were still dawdling a little over a minute later when Christian Benteke, a striker so shorn of confidence over recent weeks, bustled forward from the halfway line. David Luiz attempted to stifle his progress only for the ball to deflect to Zaha, sprinting up in support. The Ivorian’s return pass found Benteke alone in front of Courtois, with the striker calmly waiting for his compatriot to go to ground before lifting a delightful finish into the gaping net. It was his first league goal since the end of January.\n\n“Instead of their heads going down, which is what I saw when I first arrived, I saw a massive response,” said Allardyce. “Determination and will to get back into the game ... the two goals we scored put Chelsea in shock. It was an outstanding result.”\n\nFor all that, so much thereafter hinged upon Hennessey’s brilliance and Sakho’s rugged refusal to grant Chelsea a sight of goal, Zaha’s pace and trickery also offered Palace hope on the break.\n\n“There’s a man on the other side, in Hazard, who is an outstanding individual like Wilf and his ability is something Wilf could look at to try and match,” said Allardyce.\n\nHe has grown infuriated discussing the winger’s future at the club with constant talk of Tottenham’s long-standing interest in the 24-year-old. “Wilf is already realising his potential with the way he’s playing. Potential is becoming a reality.”\n\nPalace’s only disappointment was a potentially serious knee injury suffered by Scott Dann, a half-time replacement for the injured James Tomkins, but their reshaped back-line repelled everything flung at them over the frenetic final exchanges.\n\nThis was a result to fire hope that relegation can be staved off. It was also a Chelsea defeat to preserve a degree of intrigue in the title chase.\n\nTottenham close gap at top as Son Heung-min goal seals win at Burnley Read more\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Palace fans celebrate after Benteke’s goal.

Andrew Robertson’s strike after the break had cancelled out West Ham striker Andy Carroll’s landmark opener.\n\nThis victory was their fourth in five unbeaten league games at home under their head coach Marco Silva and lifted them level on points with their relegation rivals Swansea, who play Middlesbrough on Sunday, while West Ham slumped to a fourth straight defeat.\n\nWatford return to winning ways as Miguel Britos adds to Sunderland’s woes Read more\n\nBilic said: “The only way you can stop the speculation is if you win games or get a point or climb up the table. After four defeats of course I can expect even more speculation, but as I said I wasn’t worried before and I’m not worried now. I’m doing my job. I’m very motivated and very positive.”\n\nThe visit of West Ham had been billed as the return of winger Robert Snodgrass, sold to the Londoners for £10.2m in January, but the Scot made little impact and was withdrawn in the second half.\n\nSnodgrass was booed every time he was on the ball, but almost silenced the Tigers fans in the 13th minute when he headed Sofiane Feghouli’s bouncing right-wing cross straight at goalkeeper Eldin Jakupovic.\n\nNeither side had mustered an effort on goal until that point, but West Ham took the lead with their next chance five minutes later. Hull’s captain Curtis Davies misjudged his headed clearance from Aaron Cresswell’s excellent cross and, as the ball dropped invitingly for Carroll six yards out, the big No9 kept his composure to side-foot home on the volley for his 50th Premier League goal and seventh of the season.\n\nJakupovic denied West Ham a second soon after when he turned away Manuel Lanzini’s dipping, low shot from outside the area. Hull tried to rally and only some desperate defending denied Oumar Niasse a shooting chance in the area after Sam Clucas’s clever back-heel, but the home side failed to trouble Darren Randolph at all in the first period.\n\nAn out-of-sorts Davies was withdrawn for the winger Kamil Grosicki at the interval as Silva looked to inject some vigour into his side and not for the first time this season his tactical switch paid dividends.\n\nHull’s best move of the match saw Lazar Markovic link well with Grosicki and the latter slipped in a marauding Robertson to run on into the area and bury a low left-footed shot into the bottom corner for a 53rd-minute equaliser.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Hull City’s Andrew Robertson celebrates scoring.

Jamie Vardy confirmed the victory in the second half by scoring with a fine volley.\n\nFurther vindication was perhaps the gift desired most by Srivaddhanaprabha, who turns 60 on Tuesday, and a fifth win from five matches since Craig Shakespeare assumed managerial duties amounts to a strong endorsement of the club owner’s decision to sack Claudio Ranieri in February.\n\nWest Bromwich Albion frustrate Manchester United the Tony Pulis way Read more\n\nThis was a day when anyone doubting Leicester was made to look foolish. Twenty-four minutes had elapsed when the Stoke City fans struck up a chant of “Champions of England – you’re having a laugh” whereupon Ndidi wiped the smile off their faces in the most satisfying way. After receiving a pass from Danny Simpson, the 20-year-old took one touch to set himself up for a shot that seemed ill-advised and then thrashed the ball into the top corner from 25 yards. He hit it with such power that by the time the Stoke goalkeeper Lee Grant had finished diving, Ndidi was already cupping an ear to savour the cheers of the Leicester supporters and the stunned silence of the visitors. Shut-ups have seldom been more spectacular.\n\nIn truth the Stoke contingent had been jeering the hosts merely in the name of terrace repartee rather than to denounce Leicester’s performance, as the champions had been the superior side in a bright first 25 minutes. Demarai Gray, who would have been on the bench if Marc Albrighton had not reported ill in the morning, was causing regular trouble down the left wing with his speed and trickery, even after Ryan Shawcross upended him with a late tackle in the 17th minute. The free-kick following that foul almost led to a goal, Christian Fuchs’ delivery provoking a goalmouth scramble and forcing Erik Pieters to head the ball away in a panic before Glen Johnson intervened to stop Vardy from converting from close range.\n\nMark Hughes, the Stoke manager, admitted afterwards that his team “were a yard short all day” but it was only after Ndidi’s rocket that Leicester really took flight. Shinji Okazaki went close with an overhead kick following a corner, his effort whizzing over the bar. Then Riyad Mahrez tried to join in the fun with a devilish low shot from 20 yards. This time Grant’s dive was not in vain and the keeper managed to tip the ball around the post.\n\nIf the interval came at an opportune time for Stoke, they did not seem to make wise use of it as less than two minutes after the resumption they fell further behind. Their problem began with another incursion by Gray, this time down the right, and it was aggravated when the winger laid the ball back to Simpson, who swept in a cross that caught Johnson dozing. There were no flies on Vardy, however, and the striker took advantage of the full-back’s negligence to wallop the ball into the net with a terrific volley from 12 yards.\n\nChelsea stunned by resurgent Crystal Palace and Christian Benteke Read more\n\nThat was the England striker’s sixth goals in his last eight matches in all competitions, a tally that reflects his rejuvenation since Shakespeare replaced Ranieri as manager.\n\nFurther evidence of Leicester’s transformed fortunes came in the 70th minute, when Marko Arnautovic had a goal disallowed after being wrongly flagged for offside.\n\nLeicester are still only six points above the relegation zone but no one is talking any more about them becoming the first reigning champions since 1938 to drop out of the top flight. Instead Leicester helped Shakespeare create a small piece of history of another sort, as this victory made him the first British manager in the Premier League era to win his first four league matches in charge. The only other men to have done so are Pep Guardiola, José Mourinho, Carlo Ancelotti and Guus Hiddink. “I’m at a very, very early stage in my management career but to be mentioned in the same breath as them makes me very proud,” said Shakespeare. “You sometimes have to pinch yourself.”\n\nHughes, a veteran in the management game, is suitably impressed with his counterpart. “He’s doing exceptionally well. He’s got a good team, a good group, and he’s getting what he wants out of them at the moment. Being a No1 is completely different to being a No2 but he’s making a good fist of it.”"}, {"date": "01/04/2017", "arena": "Old Trafford", "attendance": 75397, "home_team": {"name": "Manchester

what was Manchester United’s eighth draw at Old Trafford.\n\nWith the defeat to Manchester City it is now 19 points ceded by Mourinho’s team at home this season. Factor in Liverpool’s earlier win to leave United six points behind Jürgen Klopp’s men – with two matches in hand – and this was not a happy day for the manager.\n\nChelsea stunned by resurgent Crystal Palace and Christian Benteke Read more\n\nTony Pulis’s side were particularly negative, so when asked if United and West Brom were of a similar level Mourinho said: “You think the game was equal? I can smile win, lose or draw. I am sorry to say, it is a silly question. When the team crosses the line once in 90 minutes and when the team is in the opposition half trying and trying and trying, you ask if we were equal? David de Gea was sleeping and he did the funny thing at the end, I was laughing with that.”\n\nThis last comment referred to a late Darren Fletcher effort that went through the goalkeeper’s hands on to the bar before De Gea clutched it. A winner for Pulis’s defence-first-and-last team would have been unfair. As Mourinho said: “One team had the ball, one team didn’t. One team tried to win, the other tried to draw. One keeper did a funny thing, the other made three great saves.”\n\nOf the dropped points, the Portuguese said: “We have a lot of draws this season. Teams come here just to defend. Goalkeepers come here to be man of the match. We cannot score a goal even when we are one-on-one. We beat everyone on quality of play and direction of the game, possession, creation and ambition but we drew too many matches.”\n\nTottenham close gap at top as Son Heung-min goal seals win at Burnley Read more\n\nMourinho pointed blame at the attacking quartet of Jesse Lingard, Marcus Rashford, Anthony Martial and Henrikh Mkhitaryan for lacking a killer touch. “Today for 90 minutes [Antonio] Valencia was consistent, Ashley Young was consistent, Marcos Rojo was consistent, Eric Bailly was consistent, [Marouane] Fellaini was consistent, [Michael] Carrick was consistent,” he said, of his defence and midfield. “And the other ones were not consistent, the other ones were a flash of talent, a glimpse of talent, almost a goal and we need to keep opponents and this is deja vu all season. When you score a goal against these teams [who United have drawn against] you don’t win 1-0. You win three or 4-0 because if we score a goal the game is open and you have a different story. Then they have to play a different way and we are not consistent on this. We miss easy chances.”\n\nThe manager hinted the attack is where he will look to strengthen in the summer. “In football, especially in teams that want to win things, you need consistency in the individual,” he said when asked his priorities in the market. “In these teams at this level you need to be consistent.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mourinho and Pulis at full-time. Photograph: Andrew Yates/Reuters\n\nMourinho said the attacking quartet vanished at times against Albion. “Then a couple of players disappear and there are 10 minutes when you don’t see them and you see always the same people, always the same guys in front of the train pulling the train, so it’s disappointing, yes, because it’s one more draw.”\n\nUnited remain unbeaten since losing 4-0 at Chelsea on 23 October. “It’s an amazing unbeaten run, 19 matches in the modern Premier League is amazing,” Mourinho said. “It is fantastic but too many draws at home because some draws away from home are very acceptable, positive, you can deal with it but there are too many draws at home.”\n\nPulis’s side did not come to attack and the manager was fair in acknowledging West Brom did not deserve to win via De Gea’s mistake near the final whistle. “If we won at the end, it would have been unjust,” said the manager, whose side remain eighth. “We are really pleased with the effort and commitment they put in today, United have some really good players. No matter how well set up you are, you will always be on your back foot. We have players who can do better in possession but it is a fabulous point to get at Old Trafford. The group plays very well together, they play very compact but we had opportunities to spring out of it like against Arsenal. Their resilience and commitment was fantastic.”\n\nNext for United are Everton on Tuesday but they could have Paul Pogba back, as he trained on the pitch afterwards here.

A match full of chances, the scoreline remained low only thanks to impressive goalkeeping by Huerelho Gomes and, especially, Jordan Pickford.\n\n“We don’t need a miracle, but we do need to win games,” Moyes said. “We needed to get something from this game and I think we deserved to get something from this game, but we haven’t played well enough for long enough this season. We defended well at set-pieces against one of the biggest teams in the league, apart from one, and that was enough.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Watford’s M’Baye Niang in action with Lamine Koné.

I think we have been always far away from relegation and very troubled with injury. Our aim was always to stay in the Premier League.”\n\nTottenham close gap at top as Son Heung-min goal seals win at Burnley Read more\n\nThe game was played at a feisty pace, especially in the first half, with the teams exchanging blows throughout the opening 45 minutes. Jack Rodwell had an effort deflected on to the roof of the net and Adnan Januzaj a cross-shot turned round the post by Gomes before 10 minutes were up.\n\nThe hosts punched back immediately with Étienne Capoue’s forceful 11th-minute breakaway ending with first Niang and then Abdoulaye Doucouré drawing saves from Pickford with long-range efforts. In the 20th minute, Stefano Okaka, the striker deputising for an unwell Troy Deeney, should have done better than head Capoue’s cross over from six yards out.\n\nAndrea Ranocchia gives Hull renewed hope with late win against West Ham Read more\n\nHalf-time arrived with the result finely poised and the teams evenly matched, but after the restart Watford slowly ground their way on top.\n\nMazzarri brought off the reliable Nordin Amrabat for the raw pace and power of Success. The hosts started to crank up the corner count and one resulted in the opening goal. Tom Cleverley, who agreed a permanent deal at Vicarage Road this week, found the immovable object of Okaka on the penalty spot. His header was powerful but somehow deflected on to the bar by Fabio Borini. From the rebound, Craig Cathcart found the composure to pick a header out to the far post where Britos arrived to leap over two defenders and thump the ball into the roof of the net.\n\nMoyes swiftly made changes, withdrawing Januzaj for Wahbi Khazri. A packed Sunderland end booed the Belgian, who once again looked short of the fighting spirit required for a relegation battle, and cheered the Algerian, so crucial to the Wearsiders’ escape from relegation last year. But by the end, bar a long-range effort from Borini, Sunderland had barely crafted a chance.

It was Bournemouth’s 10th penalty of the season – no team have won more in the top flight – but after scoring their first seven they have now missed their last three.\n\nSouthampton 0-0 Bournemouth: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nThese teams started the day level on points and finished it in the same manner, after an ultimately profligate display from both sides. Arter’s miss was almost identical to that of Harry Kane’s in December, with his standing foot giving way in more or less exactly the same spot at St Mary’s.\n\n“There is no blame [attached] to any individual who misses, I am just glad that we are making the chances,” Eddie Howe said, keen to outline the positives after Bournemouth extended their unbeaten run to four matches.\n\nThis was a south-coast derby, geographically at least, and a match-up that is slowly blossoming on the Premier League stage. After eight weeks away from St Mary’s, Southampton settled quickly, but as Claude Puel was keen to point out, the international break eventually took its toll, with 15 players away with their respective countries.\n\n“It is not an excuse, but it is difficult,” Puel said, although Maya Yoshida still started in defence, despite travelling more than 14,000 miles over the international break with Japan. Jay Rodriguez led the line in the absence of Manolo Gabbiadini, who remains a doubt for Wednesday’s game against Crystal Palace because of a groin injury.\n\nDusan Tadic also kept his place, despite his manager accusing the midfielder of showing him a lack of respect last week, after publicly voicing his frustration about being continually substituted. They had words and they seemed to have the desired effect, with the Serb a menace throughout here.\n\nRodriguez, who scored twice in this fixture in December, was again a nuisance and forced Artur Boruc, back at St Mary’s for the first time since May 2014, into a fine save from a powerful volley.\n\nBournemouth, although on the back foot, almost took the lead when Andrew Surman got the faintest of touches on the ball after it dropped in the box from Ryan Fraser’s corner. Fraser Forster made a mess of it and Steven Davis cleared off the line.\n\nMarch proved magnificent for Bournemouth – with Howe picking up the manager of the month award – and he had no intentions of allowing his team to begin April with a whimper. Southampton controlled the contest, with Bournemouth made to soak up large spells of pressure.\n\nIn doing so they waited patiently for an opening to present itself, although when it did, after 61 minutes, Benik Afobe failed to pounce, shooting harmlessly wide.\n\nSouthampton then poured forward, with the substitute Shane Long this time guilty of firing wide after further invention by Tadic.\n\nHowe recognised one creative spark would change the game and looked to Jack Wilshere from the bench. He made a difference, but it was Fraser who took the immediate initiative. The winger jinked into the box, with Southampton reluctant to challenge his dainty footwork. But when Oriol Romeu eventually cleared, the ball fell at the feet of Adam Smith, who let fly from distance. His effort struck the post before a scramble ensued. Southampton would survive, although Bournemouth’s best opportunity was still to come.\n\nWilshere threaded the ball through for Fraser, amid little danger, but Ryan Bertrand was adjudged by the referee, Jonathan Moss, to have made contact with the winger.\n\nWith Joshua King departed and Afobe having also missed from the spot against West Ham United, the onus was on Arter to convert. But he lost his footing and blazed high into the Northam Stand.\n\n“I do not know where we go next,” Howe said, when asked about who might take a penalty should one arise at Liverpool on Wednesday. “We will have to have a think about it and see.”"}, {"date": "19/03/2017", "arena": "Riverside Stadium", "attendance": 32689, "home_team": {"name": "Middlesbrough", "lineup": [{"name": "Victor

into the tunnel but, away from the sound and fury, both managers were left harbouring grounds for cautious optimism.\n\nHope can be a fragile commodity but on a day when goals from Marouane Fellaini, Jesse Lingard and Antonio Valenica lifted his side to fifth, José Mourinho can still dream of gate-crashing the top four while, thanks to Gestede, Boro at least scored their first goal in five League games.\n\nThey have now gone 11 games without a win but there were signs that life after Mourinho’s old friend Aitor Karanka, who was sacked on Thursday, might be looking up under the much more attacking interim manager Steve Agnew.\n\nMiddlesbrough 1-3 Manchester United: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nWith slow-motion replays indicating that initial suggestions Gestede had attempted to bite Bailly were inaccurate, Agnew should be free to deploy the 4-4-2 formation which enabled the 19th‑placed Boro to finish strongly here in their next three, vital games – against Swansea City, Hull City and Burnley.\n\nSignificantly, an afternoon which ended with Mourinho refusing to answer questions about his part in that tunnel fracas, neglecting to shake Agnew’s hand on the pitch and, not entirely convincingly, denying he had exchanged cross words with Stewart Downing, aka Karanka’s bete noire, left Boro’s caretaker quietly satisfied following an impressive second half.\n\nKaranka’s successor might not have been left smiling had Marcus Rashford not spurned a highly inviting early opening, though. After meeting Lingard’s ball and proceeding to burn Bernardo off with that astonishing pace, the young striker – without a League goal since September – misplaced his shot, permitting Víctor Valdés to save.\n\nValdés’s own, unhappy, stint at United featured only a couple of first-team appearances but he showed off high‑calibre reflexes courtesy of a pair of quite stunning saves to first thwart Rashford’s attempt to turn in Juan Mata’s low cross and then, almost instantly, repel Valenica’s shot on the rebound.\n\nYet even Valdés was confounded when Ashley Young deceived the overstretched Antonio Barragan – experiencing an awful afternoon – before unleashing a deep cross met by Fellaini’s forehead. The Riverside emitted a collective groan as, played onside by Ben Gibson, Fellaini rose above Fabio before thumping a header beyond the goalkeeper’s reach. It was the Belgian’s first League goal since December 2015 and left Steve Gibson, Boro’s watching owner, looking rueful, as a tracksuited Agnew urged his troops to regroup.\n\nIf Valdés’s heroics were responsible for keeping Boro in the game and Rashford’s highly convincing Thierry Henry impression as, invariably cued up by Lingard, he persistently peeled away from the hapless, consistently outpaced Bernardo, was becoming an ominously recurring theme, there remained hints that a draw was not entirely out of the question.\n\nWhile Downing, recalled to arms by Agnew after spending far too many months in Karanka’s deep freeze, showed off the odd classy manoeuvre, Gaston Ramírez, Álvaro Negredo and Marten de Roon all missed half chances while Negredo had a penalty claim against Phil Jones dismissed. Such skinny statistics failed to do justice to the clear improvement in Boro’s game. Infinitely more attack-minded than before, they enjoyed more possession than usual while Ramírez prompted persistent malfunctioning of the Bailly‑Valencia axis down United’s right.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Marouane Fellaini heads Manchester United into the lead. Photograph: Lee Smith/Reuters\n\nUnfortunately for Agnew, Lingard had clearly tired of playing in Rashford – who for all that exhilarating movement was repeatedly let down by his final ball – so when Mata set him free, he ignored a couple of decent passing options and simply accelerated to around 25 yards out, whereupon he dispatched a viciously bending shot which swerved away from Valdés as it curved, imperiously, towards the top corner. Once again, Bernardo and Barragan stood off.\n\nRather than opt for damage limitation, Boro’s caretaker aimed to at least end the goalless run by liberating Gestede and Adama Traoré from the bench. Evidently concerned by the former’s aerial ability and the latter’s pace, Mourinho displayed Karanka-esque pragmatism in replacing Mata with Marcos Rojo and switching from a back three to a back four.\n\nUndeterred, Gestede, following Downing’s slightly speculative left‑wing cross, swiftly delighted in side-footing from close range Boro’s first goal in more than eight hours of League football. The ball was headed on by Negredo and then De Roon and, aided by botched attempts at clearing from Phil Jones and then Chris Smalling – the ball falling to the defender’s weaker left foot – Gestede revelled in applying the final touch.\n\nGareth Southgate says England players can benefit from moving abroad Read more\n\nUnder Karanka Boro rarely seemed to have sufficient bodies in the box to polish off such chances but their new‑found boldness indicated fortune really does favour the brave – not to mention ruffling Mourinho’s players, who were drawn into a spot of argy bargy as Boro pressed for an equaliser and Gestede and Bailly crossed swords.\n\nIn stoppage time a flattering gloss was applied to United’s victory as, attempting to make a routine clearance from Downing’s back pass, Valdés slipped, permitting Valencia to walk the ball into the net.

This was a 13th consecutive win at White Hart Lane in all competitions, with 10 of them having come in the league and, if it was underpinned by angst in the second half, as Southampton mounted a comeback, they got the job done.\n\nThe visitors had gone close during the first half and, when James Ward-Prowse scored to cut the deficit in half on 52 minutes, they pressed on to the front foot. But, for all their latent menace, Southampton did not have a moment when they threatened the equaliser. Mauricio Pochettino’s Tottenham substitutions were designed to see the game out, with one of them being the midfielder, Harry Winks, for the striker, Son Heung-min. His team ground their way to the points.\n\nTottenham Hotspur v Southampton: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nTottenham missed their top scorer, Harry Kane, who has started his latest spell of rehabilitation following ankle ligament damage and in his stead Son did little to distinguish himself apart from a few darting runs.\n\nPochettino made it clear that the result was all important and it was secured by Christian Eriksen’s drive and Dele Alli’s penalty, the award of which had seemed a little soft.\n\nSouthampton were guilty of a series of scuffs and a failed attempt to clear and, when Steven Davis stamped in to take control, he did not notice Alli on his blindside. For Alli it was all about getting to the ball first and then feeling the contact. In Kane’s absence he stepped up to the spot and he now has 17 goals in all competitions this season.\n\nMoments earlier Manolo Gabbiadini, Southampton’s in‑form striker, had been forced off with a groin injury, which Claude Puel hoped was not too serious, and his replacement Shane Long was unable to get on straight away – even though he was stripped.\n\nLong was apoplectic on the touchline and Southampton conceded the penalty while they were down to 10 men, which Puel would complain about afterwards.\n\nSouthampton’s ire was stoked further in first-half stoppage time when Ben Davies swung and connected with Dusan Tadic’s shin inside the area. Before the impact the Tottenham defender looked to have got a piece of the ball but Puel felt that, if the referee, Andre Marriner, “gives the first penalty, then he needs to give the penalty for us. I cannot see the difference.”\n\nIt was pointed out to Puel that Marriner had been in charge of his team’s EFL Cup final defeat against Manchester United, when he controversially disallowed a legitimate Gabbiadini goal for offside. “The details were very important and, as against Manchester, they were not for us,” Puel said.\n\nThis was only Southampton’s third game in five weeks, since their win at Sunderland on 11 February and perhaps that lack of games played a part as they were guilty of a lapse in the early running, from which Eriksen profited. Nobody in red-and-white got close enough to the Denmark international and, having moved to the edge of the box, he fizzed a shot into the bottom corner.\n\nArsène Wenger determined to stay on as Arsenal manager Read more\n\nSouthampton had their moments at 1-0 down and there were winces on 28 minutes, in particular, when Tadic blazed over from the edge of the six-yard box, after Nathan Redmond had volleyed back Cédric Soares’s deep cross. Oriol Romeu sent a pot-shot narrowly wide and Gabbiadini fired into the side-netting after a smart one-two with Tadic.\n\nToby Alderweireld extended Fraser Forster with a header from Eriksen’s corner in the 23rd minute while Alli had earlier spun and shot straight at the goalkeeper. “Dele has an unbelievable personality and all is possible with him,” Pochettino said.\n\n“In the box he looks like a striker and outside the box he plays like a midfielder. I watched him when he was 17 years old at Milton Keynes and he played as a holding midfielder against Manchester United. Maybe one day he plays as a goalkeeper, full-back or centre-back.”\n\nThere were some outstanding performances in midfield, not least from Tottenham’s former Saint, Victor Wanyama, whose power in the one-on-one challenges is something to behold. On the other side Romeu was a snapshot in tenacity and polished technique. He drove Southampton’s second-half superiority.\n\nPuel could be proud of how his players responded to Alli’s penalty and their goal followed a botched attempt by Alderweireld to deal with Ryan Bertrand’s cross. With Jan Vertonghen wrong-footed behind him, Ward-Prowse took a touch and squeezed his shot past Hugo Lloris.\n\nYet the closest Southampton came to parity was when the substitute, Sofiane Boufal, blasted well wide from outside the box.\n\nThe Tottenham substitute, Vincent Janssen – who provided a focal point late on – nearly added a third for his team only for Forster to touch his fierce shot over the crossbar."}, {"date": "19/03/2017", "arena": "Etihad Stadium", "attendance": 54449, "home_team": {"name": "Manchester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Willy Caballero", "yellows": [], "reds": [],

to recall the last time a 1-1 draw had provided so much incident and drama. Between them, Manchester City and Liverpool kept up a long narrative of breathless, energetic football. A two-goal thriller that had just about everything: controversy, penalties, non‑penalties, near-unremitting attacking and, from Adam Lallana, a miss that might wake him in a cold sweat. Everything, in fact, apart from a winner.\n\nPep Guardiola: Manchester City draw with Liverpool ‘one of my happiest days’ Read more\n\nLallana will certainly not wish to see the replay of the moment late on when Georginio Wijnaldum and Roberto Firmino combined to leave him with a golden chance, six yards out, only for the England international to take his eye off the ball. A second Liverpool goal seemed a near certainty and it was the first incident Jürgen Klopp mentioned in his post‑match interviews.\n\nThe only consolation for Lallana is that Sergio Agüero, scorer of City’s equaliser, missed another opportunity a few minutes later that a striker with his goals record would normally be expected to convert as a matter of routine. The chance went high into the crowd and, without wishing to sound too corny, perhaps it was fair that the game finished as a draw. Both sides had given everything. They could both reflect on chances to win, and they could both have lost. It was a tremendous battle, full of everything that is good about the Premier League, featuring two sides playing with a shared sense of adventure.\n\nNot that City will see it that way, perhaps, given that James Milner should really have been sent off for depriving Raheem Sterling a near-certain goal in the first half. Milner’s foul on Sterling was missed by the referee, Michael Oliver, and that had considerable ramifications bearing in mind it was the former City player who opened the scoring with a penalty of his own five minutes into the second half.\n\nTo dwell too much on the various penalty appeals would perhaps be unfair when the game was such a rich spectacle, not only because of the speed and skill of the players but also the spirit in which both teams faced one another down. Exhibit A: the mistimed tackle from Yaya Touré that connected painfully, studs-up, with Emre Can’s shoulder as he lay on the floor. Touré might have been in trouble if Can had indulged in some pretend agony. The Liverpool player was straight back on his feet, earning a round of applause from the home crowd.\n\nEqually, there is no doubt the game’s controversies formed a considerable part of the narrative and it was a difficult occasion for the match officials. By half-time, there were already four penalty appeals to sift through and, uppermost among them, it was an almighty let-off for Liverpool when David Silva, such a gem of a player, sent a low cross into the six-yard area and Milner’s sliding challenge connected with Sterling’s right foot as he was waiting to turn the ball into an unguarded net.\n\nJürgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola cancel each other out in frantic contest | Michael Cox Read more\n\nThe mitigation for Oliver is that everything happened so quickly it was difficult at first to be clear whether Sterling had taken his eye off the ball or if Milner had caused the miss. Fernandinho might have made the argument irrelevant if he had been able to turn in the ball at the far post but the Brazilian was caught by surprise, turning his shot into the side-netting, and the replays confirmed that Sterling had been clipped. It was a subtle, yet decisive, intervention from Milner and would have been his last involvement if Oliver had not missed it.\n\nIn response, Liverpool might point out there was a reasonable argument that Touré had manhandled Wijnaldum for a possible penalty earlier in the first half. Yet City had a separate case that Agüero was impeded by Ragnar Klavan from another early chance. Klopp, meanwhile, felt the opening 45 minutes had another potential red-card incident – stretching it, this one – when Sadio Mané outran the accident‑prone Nicolás Otamendi and went down in the penalty area.\n\nA more realistic view is that Mane’s foot had connected with Otamendi, rather than the other way around, and Guardiola had the more legitimate grievances. Liverpool certainly rode their luck at times but there were also periods when they looked the more rounded side in terms of getting the balance right between defence and attack. Milner’s penalty came from Gaël Clichy slipping at a key moment, then flattening Firmino in his desperation to make amends, and they will be disappointed they could not add a second goal to recognise how often they threatened the home side from that point onwards. Aside from Lallana, Firmino had an outstanding chance, running on to Philippe Coutinho’s pass, and Willy Caballero’s save was vital for the home side salvaging a draw.\n\nThe equaliser came after 69 minutes. Fernandinho sprayed a pass out to De Bruyne on the right wing and the Belgian’s delivery into the six-yard box was measured beautifully. Agüero had been anticipating the cross and stroked a first-time shot past Simon Mignolet from eight yards.\n\nThe rest of the match, like much of what had gone before, was played at a rare speed and maybe, to be generous, it was a touch of fatigue that denied Liverpool their best chance. Lallana, Klopp reported, had apologised for his wastefulness. Agüero’s miss spared him any more misery and Chelsea remain a speck in the distance."}, {"date": "18/03/2017", "arena": "The Hawthorns", "attendance": 24065, "home_team": {"name": "West Bromwich

Albion team who, in losing their last two matches, appeared to have switched off on reaching 40 points.\n\nThere was no such luck for the visitors, who remain outside the top four after losing for a fourth time in five league games and will not gain their annual pass into the Champions League playing like this. Two of the goals Arsenal conceded were from set pieces, always on the cards against a Tony Pulis side, and the one in between followed a farcical mix-up in defence.\n\nThere were occasional flickers of interest from Alexis Sánchez, at least until his mobility was reduced by a wild challenge that brought James McClean a booking, though players such as Theo Walcott and Danny Welbeck were merely peripheral presences. “There’s only one Arsène Wenger,” could be heard throughout the game; unfortunately it was the home fans doing the chanting.\n\nWest Bromwich Albion 3-1 Arsenal: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nWest Brom got off to a flying start. After breaking into the Arsenal penalty area Allan Nyom might have done better after five minutes than hammer a cross across the face of goal that neither Salomón Rondón nor Darren Fletcher could reach. But when Chris Brunt’s inspired pass allowed McClean to bring an early save from Petr Cech the home side took the lead from the corner. Nacer Chadli’s delivery was excellent andCraig Dawson timed his leap to perfection to climb above Laurent Koscielny and head down and in from barely two yards out.\n\nFrom that point on it looked as though it might be another long afternoon for Wenger, subjected to the indignity of a light aircraft buzzing the ground trailing a banner demanding his removal, though his players did manage to dust themselves down and draw level within four minutes. Granit Xhaka’s diagonal ball picked out Sánchez unmarked at the far post and before the home cover could close him down he had controlled the ball with his chest and rifled a shot past Ben Foster.\n\nPlay Video 0:59 Arséne Wenger promises decision on his Arsenal future 'soon' – video\n\nThe action was evenly balanced for the remainder of the first half, so much so in fact that another plane appeared carrying a banner reading: “In Arsène We Trust.” Typical Arsenal. Why stop at one ostentatious gesture if you can afford two?\n\nOn the pitch Walcott was unable to convert at one end after Sánchez had won the ball from Chadli, and Fletcher brought a save from Cech at the other with a shot on the turn from Jake Livermore’s neat pass behind the Arsenal back line. That turned out to be the Arsenal goalkeeper’s last significant action, for he pulled up sharply in the act of passing to Xhaka a couple of minutes later and immediately signalled he could not carry on and was replaced by the Colombian David Ospina.\n\nThe second half opened with Rondón missing a header in front of goal after reaching Brunt’s cross ahead of Koscielny, at which point Pulis hooked his striker in favour of Hal Robson-Kanu. This looked like a stroke of coaching genius when the substitute scored with his first touch.\n\nThere was an element of comedy to the goal, Ospina leaving his line to deal with Chadli’s chip into the box but succeeding only in finding Robson-Kanu. Although Arsenal felt McClean was both offside and interfering he was not actually obstructing anyone by allowing the ball to roll through his legs. “I thought he was offside at first,” Wenger admitted. “I’ve seen replays since and he wasn’t.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Another banner flown over the Hawthorns during Arsenal’s defeat. Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Reuters\n\nOlivier Giroud took the field on his usual rescue mission but it was Welbeck who slapped a header against the crossbar from Xhaka’s corner, before Ospina made some amends for his earlier misjudgment by leaving his line promptly to deny Robson-Kanu a second.\n\nThough Wenger could be seen debating the legitimacy of West Brom’s second goal with the fourth official for some minutes afterwards, any sense of grievance Arsenal had went out of the window when the home side scored a third. Again from a corner, again from Dawson, this time finding space for a free header on the six-yard line.\n\nAt such times Wenger really must feel like giving up. “You don’t know what you’re doing,” was the travelling support’s reaction to the sight of Sánchez being replaced by Alex Iwobi, even though Wenger felt the Chilean should not have come out for the second half.

He was looking to prove a point after being left out of the England squad despite scoring five goals in his last six appearances, yet the afternoon was to end on a sour note.\n\nZaha, who played for Southgate in the England Under-21s, went down on the edge of the box under a challenge from Craig Cathcart in the game’s first meaningful incident after four minutes. The referee, Martin Atkinson, waved away the protests and, on closer inspection, Zaha appeared to be pushed but the contact came just outside the area.\n\nAfter that there was little to report during the first half as both teams struggled to create chances on a blustery day in south London. Watford stuck to their game plan of allowing Palace possession in the second half as Deeney continued to hustle and harry against the powerful Mamadou Sakho.\n\nThe France centre-half – so instrumental in Palace’s last two victories – also seemed to be the team’s most potent attacking weapon at times with his long-range passing. Twice Christian Benteke latched on to them but could not quite create the opening. Zaha then should have done better when Andros Townsend’s cross found him at the back post and his shot was way off target.\n\nIt felt as if a goal was coming and so it proved. Switched to the left flank, Zaha was taken out by Sebastian Prödl with a wild tackle and, after a long delay while M’baye Niang received treatment, Yohan Cabaye’s free-kick skimmed off the top of Deeney’s head and in via the post.\n\n“We had to tough it out for long periods of time,” said Allardyce, who admitted that Benteke, who missed two late opportunities, was suffering a crisis of confidence in front of goal. “Today was about matching them and producing a bit of quality to win the game and that came on a couple of occasions before we got the goal. The result came about by our outstanding defending – the whole team is working hard to deny the other team opportunities and we got what we deserved in the end.”\n\nDeeney’s own goal was a cruel blow for the Watford captain, with Walter Mazzarri, the manager, complaining afterwards that Niang had been fouled in the build-up. “I’m not really worried with our position,” insisted the Italian. “We must be better going forward but, if we keep playing like that, it shouldn’t be a problem.”"}, {"date": "18/03/2017", "arena": "Goodison Park", "attendance": 39248, "home_team": {"name": "Everton",

20 league goals in a season for Everton promptly earned a move to Barcelona. It scarcely hindered Gary Lineker’s cause that he was the 1986 World Cup’s most prolific player, but Lukaku is on course for a Golden Boot of his own. An added-time double meant that, with 21, he surged clear in the Premier League scoring charts and emulated both Lineker and Bob Latchford, who was the last Everton forward to score in seven successive home games. Lukaku voiced a desire to seal a transfer that will consign him to Goodison Park history. In the meantime, he is making it.\n\nHe may eye the exit, but his attitude was impeccable. He may leave Everton behind, but he was received rapturously at the final whistle. Indeed, barely a boo greeted Lukaku before kick-off. The Gwladys Street End started to sing his name after Eldin Jakupovic tipped a howitzer of a shot over and Lukaku, who had already seen a goal ruled out when he was offside and come close with a rising shot, was eventually rewarded for his persistence.\n\n“The fans love Rom and everyone loves Rom,” said his manager, Ronald Koeman. “Yes, you may be able to hold him back for 85 minutes but then he was focused to the last second. We killed the game perfectly.”\n\nAllying two goals with an assist, Lukaku was the executioner in chief but only the third Everton forward to find the net. He had supplied the second. A minute after coming on, Enner Valencia’s first contribution was to exchange passes with Lukaku and slot home. Then the favour was returned, the Belgian scoring from the Ecuadorian’s through ball. His next provider could take less pleasure from the pass, Hull’s Omar Elabdellaoui picking out Lukaku by mistake.\n\nHe brought a cruelty to the scoreline for the visitors. “It was more tough than the final result reflected,” Koeman accepted. Lukaku can prey on the weak and if Hull prevented him from scoring with a full complement of players, they were doomed when depleted, hopes of a first away win since August departing with their captain.\n\n“I saw one game until 70 minutes and after, another game,” said their manager Marco Silva. Tom Huddlestone’s sending off, for a lunge at Idrissa Gueye, brought sympathy from Everton. “It is too harsh. It is a yellow, not a red,” said Koeman. Silva is considering mounting an appeal and said: “We didn’t deserve this decision.”\n\nThe Portuguese lamented spurned chances, particularly when Sam Clucas’ lob landed on the roof of the net after a breakdown in communications between Joel Robles and Ashley Williams. He noted, too, that Koeman felt the need to match his system, bringing on a third centre-back, Ramiro Funes Mori, with 35 minutes remaining. Lukaku immediately became more dangerous as Everton acquired a counterattacking menace.\n\nHe had wondered about the club’s ambition. The £20m signing Morgan Schneiderlin may have appeared evidence of it, but in the sole blight on Everton’s afternoon, he limped off with a calf injury that may sideline him for several weeks. But for a club Lukaku accused of living in the past, Everton nonetheless offered an enticing glimpse of the future.\n\nTwo years ago, Dominic Calvert-Lewin was playing in the Conference North for Stalybridge. Now his first top-flight goal came five divisions higher and in a move involving three players with a combined age of just 61. Ross Barkley, a comparative veteran of 23, conjured a defence-splitting pass. The 18-year-old Tom Davies displayed the energy to run on to it and centre. “The final pass was outstanding,” Koeman said and the 20-year-old Calvert-Lewin, only starting because Kevin Mirallas was attending the birth of his second child, added the finish.\n\nIt added a progressive feel to proceedings. If only briefly, Everton appear a club on the up. Their 83-day stay in seventh place was ended as they leapfrogged Manchester United. They are behind Arsenal only on goal difference. A sixth straight league win at Goodison Park, secured by an aggregate score of 22-3, also gives them the distinction of taking most points in the division in 2017. As ever, though, the statistical landmarks felt dominated by Lukaku.\n\nKoeman criticises Lukaku and warns Everton will not be held to ransom Read more"}, {"date": "18/03/2017", "arena": "Bet365

roof of Chelsea’s bench and the captain mobbed by team-mates in front of a delirious travelling contingent.\n\nThis was particularly sweet for Cahill as his push on Jonathan Walters allowed the same player to equalise Willian’s opener as the break encroached.\n\nUntil Cahill’s intervention Chelsea Chelsea had been heading for two dropped points that would have offered a glimmer of hope to the chasing Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester City. But this smash-and-grab victory will only sap spirits in north London and east Manchester.\n\nConte hailed the three points as significant, and with Chelsea leading by 13 after 28 matches he was looking at the mathematics, pointing out that the equivalent of seven more victories will guarantee the championship.\n\n“Today was a great win, a good signal but it is important to continue with the same commitment and work rate as a team,” he said. “We need to take 21 points for the title win. There are 10 games to go. I am pleased because to play Stoke at this point of the season, you have to be prepared mentally and physically. For this reason, we won today. It was a tough game, we tried to play football and deserved to win. We faced a really good team.\n\n“I am pleased for Gary Cahill because we conceded a penalty after a little push from him. To score the winning goal is great for him and our team. Diego Costa played very well and showed great discipline. It is not easy to start the game with a yellow card and then to stay calm. Diego is showing me a great will to think and fight for the team. I want to continue this way.”\n\nCosta had a typically spiky afternoon, which did not particularly impress Mark Hughes. “Diego Costa draws fouls and tries to make most of contact – when they are not fouls,” said Stoke City’s manager. “He is adept at the dark arts and everyone in football recognises that. He has many elements and factors, you have to put up with them.”\n\nStoke started brightly, troubling the visitors along their flanks. This had the home crowd urging them on though N’Golo Kanté’s slick midfield act soon had Chelsea threatening via Marcos Alonso and Costa, whose first half featured a running battle with a variety of opponents.\n\nCosta went down under a Geoff Cameron challenge perhaps too easily, which caused the midfielder to tell him to find his feet again quickly and Blues fans to reel off a few rounds of “Diego, Diego”.\n\nAn incident and noise-filled beginning next featured Alonso steaming down the left and when he drew a free-kick Chelsea made the most of the opportunity. This was as soft as goals come. From an acute angle about 30 yards out, Willian struck the ball cleanly but Lee Grant should not have allowed it to squeeze past him at his near right post. He did, though, to cue a Chelsea celebration and some despairing Stoke navel-gazing regarding how, precisely, they were 1-0 behind.\n\nOn 32 minutes Stoke started a fight-back. Marko Arnautovic collected a free-kick and his cross claimed a corner. From here the contest took a controversial turn. Bruno Martins Indi finished Cameron’s header-on but, after consultation with an assistant, Taylor ruled the strike out for Saido Berahino either pushing César Azpilicueta or for being in an offside position that interfered with play.\n\nThe next incident was the Stoke goal for which Cahill was culpable. Erik Pieters launched a diagonal free-kick from the left into the area and the defender, for some, reason shoved Walters. Taylor pointed to the spot and that was 1-1.\n\nMeanwhile the Costa-versus-Stoke sideshow continued in venomous manner, as a free-kick won by the Brazilian from a Shawcross challenge was followed by Phil Bardsley being shown a yellow card for taking him out. In the second half Costa was relatively becalmed, though he and Martins Indi continued to suggest each might boil over at any moment.\n\nAfter Alonso crashed a free-kick off the bar, Stoke’s final threat was a late Arnautovic corner that Chelsea dealt with. Now came Cahill’s winner and the feeling they will continue to handle the pressure and claim a fifth Premier League title.\n\nWhen Taylor blew for full time Bardsley had just been sent off, following a second booking, and Conte and his men greeted their fans’ jubilant singing of “We’re going to win the league” as if they, too, now firmly believe it. As Conte added: “To have a 10-points gap, 13 at the moment [is good], but I like to think our opponents will win tomorrow. We have to look at ourselves. We are happy. We must be ready to fight, today we were ready.”\n\nHughes has no doubt. “It is Chelsea’s title now,” he said."}, {"date": "18/03/2017", "arena": "Stadium of Light", "attendance": 41518, "home_team":

startled club officials by turning up for this one and, with Joey Barton frequently dictating midfield, the first half must have made for uncomfortable viewing for him.\n\nIf the moment when Burnley’s self-styled enforcer was booked for hacking down Adnan Januzaj briefly lifted the crowd, Sunderland’s strictly limited manoeuvres offered precious little else to cheer about.\n\nIndeed George Boyd would surely have given the visitors an early lead had he not misjudged Stephen Ward’s cross, shooting thin air before Jason Denayer cleared while Ashley Barnes later toe-poked inches wide with Pickford – and the entire home defence – momentarily frozen.\n\nThe Wearsiders are the only club in the bottom six not to have changed managers this season and Short’s surprise appearance prompted questions as to whether he was considering regime change.\n\nWhile that seems unlikely – although hardly an impossibility on the part of an owner with serious form for March dismissals – Moyes cut a disconsolate figure in his padded dug-out seat.\n\n“I saw Ellis this morning and he was fine. He owns the club so he’s entitled to come to matches,” said Sunderland’s manager, who lost Lamine Koné, his key defender, to an 11th-hour knee injury. “It wasn’t the prettiest but we had the chances to, on another day, have won.”\n\nSunderland’s first real opening arrived early in the second half when Fabio Borini could only shoot straight at Heaton after connecting with Bryan Oviedo’s splendid through-ball.\n\nA marginally encouraged Moyes subsequently saw Heaton do very well to keep out a volley from Januzaj – cleverly cued up by the hitherto service-starved Defoe – before Seb Larsson sliced the rebound’s fall-out over the bar.\n\nChelsea believe the title is coming after Gary Cahill sinks Stoke Read more\n\nBy now cascading rain had replaced the mist rolling in from the North Sea and Sunderland’s fragile optimism threatened to be washed away as a disbelieving Billy Jones punched the turf after heading Larsson’s cross wide.\n\nTellingly, Defoe’s body language looked increasingly frustrated, the stretching striker appearing furious at his failure to divert that effort past Heaton and then cursing a Januzaj shot that whizzed fractionally wide.\n\nAs the weather cleared, a flock of seagulls swooped into the stadium for a rather surreal fly-past, seemingly rousing Burnley. A Denayer error prefaced Pickford saving brilliantly from Sam Vokes – who also went close with a header – before the Belgian defender’s fine redeeming block prevented Arfield scoring.\n\nBorini might have enjoyed the final word but Heaton’s reflexes denied the Italian before Short’s ears were assaulted by the boos greeting the final whistle."}, {"date": "18/03/2017", "arena": "London Stadium",

routine, then Kasper Schmeichel is building a compelling case to be seen as the equal of any of his goalkeeping colleagues. The greatest goalkeepers win matches and the man whose penalty save against Sevilla ensured that Leicester City are the last English team left in the Champions League came to their rescue again by frustrating West Ham United with some wondrous late defiance.\n\nMinutes away from recording their first away win in the Premier League in 342 days, cracks were starting to appear in Leicester’s stout resistance.\n\nFor all that they have rediscovered their champion swagger at home, their revival under Craig Shakespeare had not been tested away from the King Power Stadium.\n\nIn the end, after a frenzied late assault from West Ham, they passed this test. That they did so owed much to Schmeichel’s latest heroics. The Dane was engaged in a personal duel with Andy Carroll by the end and it was difficult to know which of his two saves from the West Ham forward was better.\n\nThe first came from a low header that seemed destined for the bottom left corner until Schmeichel clawed it away. From the stands, it looked a certain goal. For pure drama and timing, however, perhaps the second stop was superior. With West Ham hammering away in search of an equaliser in stoppage time, only Schmeichel stood in their way. “He’s in the best form I’ve seen him in,” Shakespeare said after Leicester crawled six points clear of the bottom three.\n\nTroy Deeney’s own goal gifts Crystal Palace rare home win against Watford Read more\n\nThe champions had come agonisingly close to blowing their 100% record under Shakespeare. Scoring three goals for the third Premier League game running gave them a solid platform, though, and West Ham paid for a dismal first half. Slaven Bilic’s side are winless in five matches.\n\nLeicester’s response to the heavy criticism they endured after sacking Claudio Ranieri has been a reminder that the best teams do their talking on the pitch. Their faultless start to life under Shakespeare has silenced all those jibes about a dressing room full of treacherous snakes and the Foxes arrived in east London having demonstrated how fantastic they can be during that gutsy midweek victory over Sevilla.\n\n“We’re going to Madrid,” the Leicester fans chanted, giddily looking forward to next month’s Champions League quarter-final against Atlético Madrid, and it was not long before they had further cause for celebration after punishing West Ham’s muddled defending with three cheap goals inside the opening 39 minutes.\n\n“They have done some good stuff but it wasn’t from chances they created,” said Bilic, who revealed that Michail Antonio could be forced to withdraw from England duty with a hamstring injury. “It was very sloppy from our point of view. You can’t concede like that.”\n\nRiyad Mahrez’s goal in the fifth minute was a case in point. The danger looked minimal when he swung a cross into the middle from the right, only for it to drift past Darren Randolph.\n\nWest Ham’s goalkeeper was picking the ball out of his net again two minutes later. Mahrez rolled a free-kick to Marc Albrighton, who crossed for the unmarked Robert Huth to head past Randolph.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Robert Huth heads home Leicester’s second goal. Photograph: Steve Bardens/Getty Images\n\nThis was a rare occasion when West Ham’s starting 11 contained a proper right-back. Cheikhou Kouyaté has filled in there in recent weeks, but Mark Noble’s injury forced Bilic to move the Senegalese into his favoured midfield role and start Sam Byram.\n\nYet Kouyaté soon found himself trotting back into central defence when Winston Reid went down with a hamstring injury. On came Robert Snodgrass and West Ham hauled themselves back into the game when Manuel Lanzini delicately feathered a free-kick past Schmeichel, only for Jamie Vardy to pounce on further awful defending from Mahrez’s corner shortly before half-time.\n\nWest Ham grabbed another lifeline early in the second half, Carroll heading a corner back into the middle and André Ayew nodding home, and Leicester had to dig deep.\n\nWes Morgan’s back injury meant that Yohan Benalouane was starting his first league game this season and Carroll towered over the centre-back at the far post with 17 minutes left.\n\nSchmeichel was there, but Leicester were wobbling. Ayew spurned a wonderful opportunity and Kouyaté had a shot scrambled off the line, but an equaliser looked inevitable when Snodgrass’s free-kick squirmed through to Carroll.\n\nYet Schmeichel spread himself so wide that he looked like he was about to smother Carroll with a bear hug.

Eddie Howe felt he was ageing after his team’s difficult start to the year but this relentless display will have left him full of vigour.\n\nThe pressure was on for both teams, with wins for Leicester and Crystal Palace before kick-off amplifying the importance of this fixture. The significance of a result for Bournemouth was even more pertinent given that Chelsea, Liverpool and Tottenham are three of their next four opponents.\n\nLeicester’s Kasper Schmeichel plays heroic role in 3-2 victory at West Ham Read more\n\n“I do not feel any younger but I feel very pleased with the team,” Howe said. “I feel very grateful because when results are not going your way it is easy for the camp to become split or negativity to creep in. I really do admire how much the guys have been fighting for the club.”\n\nHowe was conscious of what to expect of Swansea under Paul Clement, insisting they are a “different team” since they turned them over 3-0 on New Year’s Eve. A lot has changed: Clement was skiing in the Austrian Alps at the time, Swansea were rock-bottom but they are still in trouble now after a fourth consecutive away defeat.\n\n“We must not panic, not start looking for culprits or pointing the finger – we are very much in this together,” Clement said, before referencing Bournemouth’s recent upturn in form. “We have got some really positive results over the last two and half months and we have another two and half months to go now.\n\n“The objective is very clear, to finish in 17th position and any higher than that is a bonus, based on the position we were in at the start of January.”\n\nBournemouth made a high-powered start but Swansea ensured they did not have it all their own way. Gylfi Sigurdsson’s delivery from set pieces proved problematic for the home side, with Alfie Mawson and then Joshua King, at the wrong end, heading narrowly wide.\n\nRyan Fraser, named in the senior Scotland squad for the first time this week, was again bright and bypassed Tom Carroll on the edge of the area before skimming an effort across goal and wide of Lukasz Fabianski’s right post.\n\nBut it was a slice of luck that brought Bournemouth the lead just after the half-hour mark. King beat Federico Fernández to the ball on the edge of the box and played a one-two with Marc Pugh before crossing paths with Benik Afobe who then drove towards goal. His tame shot was surely heading wide until it struck Mawson’s shin-pad, wrongfooting Fabianski as it rolled into the net. The scruffy nature of the goal typified a first half that made largely painful viewing.\n\nClement, a towering presence in his technical area, demanded a reaction. Carroll clattered into Adam Smith after earlier harrying Andrew Surman. Perhaps, though, Swansea were trying too hard. Jack Cork, a one-time Bournemouth loanee, lost the ball in the middle of the park, allowing Dan Gosling to force Fabianski into a save from distance.\n\nRomelu Lukaku maintains Everton hot streak with brace in 4-0 defeat of Hull Read more\n\nThe fear for Bournemouth was Sigurdsson, the Swansea playmaker silencing the home crowd every time he stood over a dead ball. After all, no team have conceded more points than the 18 Bournemouth have dropped from winning positions this season. Both Steve Cook and Afobe threw their bodies at crosses, with Fernando Llorente lurking.\n\nBut Bournemouth made sure of the points after 72 minutes when Afobe added a goal that this time definitely belonged to him. King was again involved, feeding the striker, while Mawson slipped, to slot past Fabianski. The Swansea goalkeeper then made a magnificent save low to his left from King’s header to deny Bournemouth a third goal.\n\n“Full credit to the players because it is one thing knowing the importance

There were a few other moments, a lot of headed challenges and then you are 1-0 down.”\n\nThe travelling support were singing “We are super Burnley” and memories flooded back of the visitors’ 2-0 defeat of Liverpool at Turf Moor in August’s reverse fixture. Then they stunned Klopp’s side after only two minutes. Now, the task for Liverpool was to avoid conceding another first-half goal, as the had done that day. Sadio Mané suggested how by taking the contest to the visitors. His cross contained menace but Origi could not reach it.\n\nWhat followed, though, was drift from the red-shirted side. On that late summer’s afternoon in Lancashire Burnley hit Liverpool on the break. Now they were allowed to operate via a patient build-up that Klopp’s high pressing system is supposed to smother. A group of players the German said had instantly focused on this encounter post-Arsenal were surprisingly disjointed, with Mané proving the only bright spark as the half-hour approached.\n\nThe familiar sight of the Senegalese bursting along the right wing before feeding Origi ended with the No27 failing to find Georginio Wijnaldum. This was the story of Liverpool’s half: no rhythm could be found. They enjoyed more ball and territory yet Burnley were comfortable. Towards the end Coutinho, who usually possesses the time that marks the best, was hassled into stabbing the ball out.\n\nThen, as can be football’s way, Liverpool grabbed an unlikely equaliser. Origi punted the ball into the area and a defensive mix-up involving Ben Mee ended with Wijnaldum burying the finish. This was the final touch before the interval.\n\nDespite the goal Klopp’s job remained the same: to engineer a turnaround in ascendancy for Liverpool. The problem is there is no solution for a manager, whatever his instructions, if the ball is wasted, as Emre Can and Coutinho continued to do at the start of the second half.\n\nOn the hour Klopp had enough and it was Coutinho who was removed for Ben Woodburn. Immediately after this Origi fed the hitherto misfiring Can and the German drilled a 25-yard shot to the left of Heaton, who might have done better.\n\nThis was followed by Can being booked and Burnley nearly profiting: from the free-kick a Mee header fell to Barnes, whose effort was blocked by Ragnar Klavan.\n\nSteven Gerrard: 'I thought I was a bit young to be Liverpool's captain at 23' Read more\n\nLiverpool finished camped in Burnley’s half and with Mané forcing a fingertip save from Heaton. But Klopp should be worried: in the closing moments Lowton might have forced the draw. It sums up the home team and their manager seems not to know which Liverpool is going to show up.\n\nDyche was right when he said Burnley deserved more fortune. “I don’t search for luck. You have to make your own but it is nice every now and again if you get a slither,” he said.\n\nWith only 10 matches remaining Klopp will take more ugly victories. “If we want to stay where we are, we need to win football games,” he said before ruling the injured Jordan Henderson out of England’s friendly with Germany and World Cup qualifier against Lithuania.\n\n“No chance,” Klopp said. “The break hopefully is two weeks. We hope that will bring him back but there will be no game in this time [for him]. He cannot train. Hopefully he can run in the second week of the international break and then we will have to see.”"}, {"date": "11/03/2017", "arena": "Vitality Stadium", "attendance": 11369, "home_team": {"name": "Bournemouth", "lineup": [{"name": "Artur Boruc", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Smith", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Simon Francis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steve Cook", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charlie Daniels", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Arter", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dan Gosling", "yellows": [80], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Fraser", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [85]}, {"name": "Joshua King", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [31, 48, 90], "missed_pens": [9], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marc Pugh", "yellows": [66], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Benik Afobe", "yellows": [72], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [37], "sub_off": [85]}], "subs": [{"name": "Max Gradel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Brad Smith", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Allsop", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lys Mousset", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [85], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Wilshere", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [85], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordon Ibe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Baily Cargill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "West Ham United", "lineup": [{"name": "Darren Randolph", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cheikhou Kouyaté", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [78]}, {"name": "José Fonte", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Winston Reid", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Cresswell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sofiane Feghouli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [58]}, {"name": "Mark Noble", "yellows": [9], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [58]}, {"name": "Pedro Obiang", "yellows": [34], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Manuel Lanzini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michail Antonio", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [10], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andy Carroll", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Robert Snodgrass", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [58], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adrián", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Collins", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "André Ayew", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [83], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [58], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sam Byram", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [78], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Arthur Masuaku", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Edimilson Fernandes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "The jubilation on the touchline said it all as Eddie Howe was mobbed by Joshua King, who wheeled away after scoring his first Premier League hat-trick to earn Bournemouth a much-needed first win this year. King and Benik Afobe had missed first-half penalties before the Norway striker scored his ninth, 10th and 11th goals of the season in a character-building home win that lifted them six points clear of the relegation zone.\n\n“It is relief from my perspective, pure relief,” Howe said. “We have gone back to basics and worked incredibly hard to try and turn things around. We still need to get to 40 points or whatever the magic total is as quickly as we can. There is no complacency to think we are not involved in a relegation battle.”\n\nBournemouth were visibly desperate for their first win in 10 matches. West Ham, meanwhile, were eventually punished for a half-baked display, despite seemingly rescuing a point through the substitute André Ayew seven minutes from time. Dimitri Payet had said how he grew bored of West Ham’s approach but this was anything but a tedious affair.\n\nRomelu Lukaku sets Everton record in three-goal romp over West Brom Read more\n\nSofiane Feghouli wrestled with the Bournemouth defender Charlie Daniels as he surged into the box, forcing the referee, Robert Madley, to point to the spot inside eight minutes. Fortunately for Feghouli, his clumsiness was not seized upon, with King striking the penalty wide of Darren Randolph’s left post. Forty-eight seconds later, Michail Antonio would open the scoring.\n\nFeghouli picked out Antonio inside the Bournemouth box before the forward, returning to Slaven Bilic’s starting line-up after serving a one-match ban, swivelled with his back to goal before squeezing his shot low into the corner.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Joshua King reacts and José Fonte celebrates after King’s missed penalty – but the striker had the final word. Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock\n\nManuel Lanzini was guilty of handing Bournemouth – and King – a chance to redeem themselves. The Argentinian’s misplaced pass on the edge of the area allowed Dan Gosling to start another attack, rounded off by King, who hooked the ball away from José Fonte with his right foot before prodding home with his left. He celebrated with both hands held aloft, appearing to apologise for his penalty miss.\n\nWest Ham lost control with Pedro Obiang and Mark Noble booked for cynical fouls. Bilic, too, grew unsporting, kicking the ball towards the advertising hoardings and away from Adam Smith on the touchline.\n\n“The dirty small things, like second balls, they were better at,” Bilic said, after watching his team lose twice in six days. “They are very good at that and we did not match them.”\n\nWest Ham were unfortunate, though, to concede another penalty, when Marc Pugh fell theatrically inside the area under Fonte’s watch. Afobe was handed the responsibility by King from 12 yards this time, but his tame strike was saved by Randolph. In doing so, Bournemouth became the first team to miss two penalties in the first half of a Premier League match since Aston Villa, against Wimbledon, in 1998. Howe’s head fell to the floor.\n\nHull survival prospects boosted as Oumar Niasse double sees off Swansea Read more\n\nThe last time Madley was here he refereed a 4-3 win over Liverpool and while this might not have been such a nostalgic occasion, it was still full of drama. Bournemouth ought to have been out of sight though the half-time interval provided West Ham with a little respite.\n\nThe second half followed suit, with Bournemouth taking the lead through King after 48 minutes. Fraser whipped in a free-kick, which Afobe helped into the path of the striker to add his second of the game.\n\nBilic threw on Sam Byram and Ayew in a bid to halt Bournemouth’s rhythm and they did so, combining to steal an equaliser seven minutes from time.

Everton are now seven points ahead of West Bromwich Albion and have given themselves the chance to overhaul Manchester United, even if only for a day, next weekend. “Sixth would be amazing,” said their manager, Ronald Koeman.\n\nEverton have spent 2017 trapped in no man’s land between the top six and the bottom 13. If they represented a target for the upwardly-mobile Midlanders, the balance of power was tilted still further towards Merseyside by one West Brom alumnus and a man Tony Pulis hoped to sign in January.\n\nRomelu Lukaku first displayed his potency in the Premier League during a season at The Hawthorns when he only started 20 games but nevertheless scored 17 goals. Four years later, and already Everton’s record scorer in the division, he continues to ally potency with statistical merit. In becoming the only Evertonian to strike 19 times in a Premier League campaign, he displaced himself from their history books. In becoming the first to reach 20 in all competitions in successive seasons since Bob Latchford, he brought echoes of their past on a day when Everton paid tribute to another former Goodison great, the late Alex Young.\n\n“Normally Romelu Lukaku will score in every game,” said Koeman, who stated his top scorer remains “very close” to signing a long-term deal. “He is one of the best strikers in the Premier League,” added an envious Pulis, pointing to a gulf in resources.\n\n“When you think how much they spent on Morgan Schneiderlin,” he reflected. He was willing to pay £20m himself and scarcely required further evidence of the midfielder’s excellence. He got it anyway, the Frenchman opening his Everton account to secure a fifth successive home league win. He supplied a deft, delicate finish, holding off Jake Livermore and beating Ben Foster, after a neat reverse pass from Lukaku.\n\n“The five minutes at the end of the first half killed us,” said Pulis after Everton’s extra quality told. Pulis’ 300th Premier League game as a manager had begun in familiar fashion as West Brom defended with well-drilled expertise. Lukaku unlocked them by veering right, pleasing Koeman with his movement, and freeing up space for runners. When he found Ross Barkley, the Englishman’s shot was parried by Foster and the recalled Kevin Mirallas buried the rebound.\n\nIt was an indication of Barkley’s influence. Another came when Lukaku headed in his scooped cross. “That’s the best I have seen Barkley play,” Pulis said.\n\nKoeman savoured an “outstanding” display, delivered in front of the England manager, Gareth Southgate and explained he had liberated the local lad. “Everyone knows Ross had a difficult time earlier in the season,” he said. “We changed his position so he’s not in midfield. In a free role, he can be creative for Romelu.”\n\nTheir chemistry is proving particularly potent. “Scoring three goals against West Brom is really difficult,” Koeman said. With Idrissa Gueye rattling the post, his team almost mustered four.\n\nManchester City and David Silva catch Middlesbrough cold to reach semi Read more"}, {"date": "11/03/2017", "arena": "KCOM

That was the first match in charge for Silva and Paul Clement, who have overseen significant improvements for their sides, with Swansea having climbed their way out of real trouble at the bottom of the table.\n\nGoals have continually been the struggle this season for Hull and that did not change during the opening 45 minutes.\n\nWayne Routledge was denied by Eldin Jakupovic and the Swansea attacker had another fine chance in the second half, but he blazed over from inside the Hull penalty area.\n\nThe key change came with 27 minutes remaining when Niasse replaced the midfielder Alfred N’Diaye. Seven minutes after his introduction Niasse was played in over the top by Abel Hernández and the Senegalese forward ran in calmly to slot past Lukasz Fabianski, showing the same composure he demonstrated against Liverpool.\n\nJoshua King hits hat-trick as Bournemouth see off West Ham in thriller Read more\n\nHe had his second nine minutes later.

We have to be very disappointed that we conceded two goals like that.\n\n“At the end we pushed at 2-0 down but we pushed too late, we didn’t really push until the 88th, 89th minute. There was a lot of pressure on Hull to get the result and they delivered.”\n\nOn the state of the pitch, the managers were scathing. Silva said: “It’s impossible at this level. There was a heavy game here yesterday. There are so many things the club needs to improve. These details make the difference.”\n\nClement said: “It’s not an ideal situation when you have a game the night before, any game, never mind rugby league.

They went from prolific to impotent, losing their lustre and missing the chance to go second as a four-match winning run in the Premier League came to an end.\n\nAgüero led Manchester City for the first time under Pep Guardiola, seemingly symbolising his restoration to prominence, but his scoring sequence stopped. City had struck five times in each of their two previous home games but after the drama of recent weeks at the Etihad Stadium came a dullness that suited leaders Chelsea, their rivals for Champions League places and Stoke, who belied their wretched record against the elite with a display of defiance.\n\nManchester City 0-0 Stoke City: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\n“Very, very satisfying,” said Mark Hughes, savouring a point on his return to a club that sacked him in 2009. His counterpart drew little comfort. A title challenge has dissipated on their own soil, where Everton, Southampton, Middlesbrough and Tottenham have also held City, leaving them with a worse home record than Burnley and Guardiola admitting: “Our results away are much better.” He claimed that City “fought like never before” but even an improved second-half display scarcely supported that.\n\nInstead, on a night when his old employers, Barcelona, scored six goals, Guardiola’s current charges showed rather less incision. He lamented a lack of movement from his forwards, which suggested Agüero was not leading from the front in the manner he had hoped.\n\nIf granting the Argentinian the armband showed that Guardiola can deploy the carrot as well as the stick, it did not have the desired effect. Demoted for Gabriel Jesus recently, promoted from the ranks here, a striker with five goals in his previous three games drew a blank. His last chance was his best, when he fired a shot into the side-netting from an acute angle, but he was well policed.\n\nYet the clearest opportunity fell to another striker. In added time, and with Guardiola’s team committing men forward, the substitute Kelechi Iheanacho volleyed wide. The chance was fashioned by Kevin De Bruyne, who provided a stream of inviting centres after he was moved to the right flank. His predecessor in that position was part of the problem as City were uncharacteristically flat. The problem was less that Jesús Navas extended a 1146-day wait for a league goal than that his crossing was typically wretched.\n\nHe was a surprise starter as Guardiola opted to rotate before supposedly bigger matches. “When you have one game a week, you can play with [the same] 11 players, no problem,” said the manager. His decisions backfired, however, with his side missing the energy of the rested Raheem Sterling. The importance of David Silva, who enlivened the evening in his cameo, was also illustrated. “We weren’t too upset when he wasn’t in the starting lineup,” said Hughes. “You saw his influence when he came on.”\n\nSuddenly, Manchester City became more coherent. Silva threatened to unlock Stoke, playing a deft one-two with Fernandinho, but his effort rolled agonisingly wide. He also took the corner that Nicolás Otamendi headed on to the roof of the net. Yet the damning reality was that a team closing in on a century of goals this season mustered a solitary shot on target. That came from the other centre-back and Lee Grant answered Aleksandar Kolarov’s free-kick with a firm parry. “The goalkeeper did not save too much,” Guardiola accepted.\n\nStoke mustered only two efforts on target themselves, neither especially threatening. They have still scored only one goal at the Etihad Stadium, Mame Biram Diouf’s 2014 winner. History briefly threatened to repeat itself when the sliding Senegalese met Erik Pieters’ sixth-minute cross but Willy Caballero pushed his shot away.\n\nThe Argentinian also saved from Bruno Martins Indi, a Dutchman who distinguished himself more with his defending. Where Monaco and Huddersfield were overwhelmed by incessant attacking here, Stoke brought a blend of organisation and determination.\n\nThey had the wrong sort of 100% record against the current top four, conceding four goals in each previous meeting. A thrashing at Tottenham had stung and this was a fine riposte. “It hurt us. We needed to answer a few questions and hopefully we have done,” added Hughes. He singled out Saido Berahino for praise, partly for the way the £15m forward defended from the front on his first start for the club, but his side showed a collective resolve.\n\nManchester City, too, have meetings with the best on their minds. Their next three league games pit them against Liverpool, Arsenal and Chelsea. If this was an opportunity to apply a little pressure to Antonio Conte’s team, it passed them by. “The gap was big,” Guardiola rued. “And it is still big.”"}, {"date": "06/03/2017", "arena": "London Stadium", "attendance": 56984, "home_team": {"name": "West Ham United", "lineup": [{"name": "Darren Randolph", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cheikhou Kouyaté", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "José Fonte", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Winston Reid", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [64]}, {"name": "Aaron Cresswell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mark Noble", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [77]}, {"name": "Pedro Obiang", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Manuel Lanzini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [90], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sofiane Feghouli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [64]}, {"name": "Andy Carroll", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robert Snodgrass", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Adrián", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Collins", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "André Ayew", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [64], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sam Byram", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [64], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Arthur Masuaku", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonathan Calleri", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Edimilson Fernandes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [77], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Chelsea", "lineup": [{"name": "Thibaut Courtois", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "César Azpilicueta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Luiz", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gary Cahill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Moses", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [76]}, {"name": "Cesc Fàbregas", "yellows": [45], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "N'Golo Kanté", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marcos Alonso", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pedro", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [65]}, {"name": "Diego Costa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [50], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eden Hazard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [25], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [75]}], "subs": [{"name": "Asmir Begovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kurt Zouma", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [76], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ruben Loftus-Cheek", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nemanja Matic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [65], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willian", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [75], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michy Batshuayi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Terry", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "In theory, there is still time for Chelsea’s rivals to catch and overhaul them at the top of the Premier League. In reality, though, it is beginning to feel almost inconceivable. Chelsea just look too strong, too experienced and too streetwise. They passed their latest test with distinction and it would have to be something dramatic now to imagine any other scenario than another open-top bus parade along the King’s Road.\n\nAnother team in Chelsea’s position might have wobbled in the circumstances – a London derby under the floodlights against an improving side – bearing in mind their two nearest challengers, Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester City, both won over the weekend. Nobody, however, should doubt the durability of the side Antonio Conte has put together. Their lead is back to 10 points and who can foresee a collapse when Eden Hazard is shimmering with this kind of menace and everyone around him is going about their business with such supreme confidence?\n\nAntonio Conte says his Chelsea players will not slip up in title race Read more\n\nChelsea now have 30 more points than at the corresponding stage last season and the only minor irritation for Conte was the stoppage-time goal from Manuel Lanzini that briefly gave West Ham hope of an improbable feat of escapology. For Chelsea, however, that was only a minor irritation. Hazard had opened the scoring with a classy breakaway strike and Diego Costa’s 18th goal of the season, early in the second half, left an air of inevitability over the rest of the evening. Chelsea threatened all night with their quick, high-quality counterattacking. They do it better than any other team in England and in those moments, with Hazard driving forward and Pedro adding his own stylish touches, it was thrilling to see.\n\nJosé Mourinho likes to say his old team operate with defensive tactics but, in reality, there is much more to Chelsea than that. They sit back and then they spring forward. Costa’s goal came from a corner but Chelsea were at their most dangerous when they broke from their own half and it was risky of West Ham to leave themselves so vulnerable this way. Slaven Bilic’s side had nine men forward when Chelsea streaked clear to score the opening goal and that is bordering on reckless when their opponents are so devastating on the break.\n\nChelsea demonstrated in those moments that counterattacking football can be exhilarating. N’Golo Kanté, the master of the dirty work, had cut out Robert Snodgrass’s pass and in the following eight seconds the ball moved 75 yards, finishing in West Ham’s net. Hazard’s one-two with Pedro was weighted perfectly and in the course of three passes the home side had been split down the middle. It was a blur of speed and movement and, at the end of it, there was a wonderful touch of composure from Hazard to swerve round the goalkeeper, Darren Randolph, and slide his shot into the exposed goal.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Eden Hazard (right) slots the ball past Darren Randolph to give Chelsea the lead. Photograph: Adrian Dennis/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThat was far from the only occasion when the speed and directness of Hazard and Pedro threatened on the break. West Ham lost their shape too easily and there was a lesson here for every team that faces Chelsea. It is that when Conte’s side are defending, sometimes they are at their most dangerous.\n\nOn that front, West Ham could probably be forgiven for feeling emboldened about the way they began the match. Andy Carroll was left with a bloodied face, having clashed heads with Victor Moses, on the first occasion when one of his team-mates tried to pick him out in the penalty area. With the game goalless, a succession of crosses was aimed Carroll’s way, causing anxiety in the visitors’ penalty area.\n\nWest Ham United 1-2 Chelsea: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nChelsea took their time to start playing like champions-in-waiting but they were always the more rounded side once they had the lead, scoring with their first attempt at goal, and might have doubled their lead before half-time after another breakaway finished with Costa narrowly missing Hazard’s cross, Moses firing in a shot that ricocheted off Aaron Cresswell and Pedro’s follow-up effort being turned away by Randolph.\n\nWest Ham had lost their early momentum and, five minutes into the second half, they conceded a second goal. This one came from Cesc Fàbregas’s corner and the inability of anyone in claret and blue to clear the danger inside the six-yard area. Pedro Obiang went up for the ball, in close proximity to Carroll, but succeeded only in flicking the ball behind him and Costa charged in to score off his thigh.\n\nMaybe the complexion of the night would have changed had Moses not been handily positioned to turn away a goal-bound shot from Sofiane Feghouli just after the hour. Yet West Ham now had the dilemma of needing a way back into the contest while also knowing that if they pushed too many men forward it would be playing into Chelsea’s hands. Unfortunately for them, by the time Lanzini fired a low shot past Thibaut Courtois it was the second minute of stoppage time and the final whistle sounded before Bilic’s side could muster another chance."}, {"date": "05/03/2017", "arena": "White Hart Lane", "attendance": 31962, "home_team": {"name": "Tottenham Hotspur", "lineup": [{"name": "Hugo Lloris", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals":

Tottenham were full value for a result that keeps them – just about – in the rearview mirror of the league leaders, Chelsea.\n\nKane had entered the game with three hat-tricks since the turn of the year and he ought to have had another one. He was denied in two one-on-ones by the goalkeeper Joel Robles, with the second on 82 minutes a particularly clear opportunity. However, as it was, Kane scored twice and yet again he made the difference. The 23-year-old is now the outright top scorer in the league this season, with 19 goals – one more than Lukaku – and he has 24 in all competitions.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Dele Alli scores Tottenham’s third goal in the Premier League match against Everton. Photograph: Ian Walton/Getty Images\n\nIt had been tight and tactical at the outset, with Everton closing the space between the lines, but Kane changed the complexion of the afternoon with the breakthrough. It came out of nothing but this is the sort of thing that can happen when he is on the field. Everton did not feel any danger when Kane picked up possession 40 yards out and Idrissa Gueye allowed him to turn and move towards goal. Gareth Barry was not worried, either, and he dropped off. It was not as if Kane had the ability to explode a right-footed shot past Robles from 25 yards. Oh, wait.\n\nIt was the prompt for a furious 10-minute period of Tottenham pressure, with Robles blocking from Kane; Christian Eriksen dragging wide after being sent through by Kyle Walker and Victor Wanyama side-footing the ball against a post from just inside the penalty area.\n\nTottenham won the right to play their football, with Mousa Dembélé and Wanyama coming to boss the middle of the pitch. The home team’s control was impressive. Koeman had started with a narrow 4-2-2-2 formation, with Barry in for the young forward Ademola Lookman and Ross Barkley pressed high alongside Lukaku. Koeman switched to 4-3-3 on 64 minutes, when he sent on James McCarthy and Kevin Mirallas but, by then, his team were two goals down.\n\nEverton had tried to play out from the back when Robles rolled the ball to Morgan Schneiderlin only for Alli and Dembélé to swarm all over him. When Schneiderlin tried to pop the ball off to Ashley Williams, he found only Alli, who touched through for Kane. One on one with Robles, there was an inevitability about the outcome. Kane took one touch to set himself and another to shoot low into the net.\n\nTottenham had policed Lukaku diligently, with Toby Alderweireld and Jan Vertonghen – who know the striker from the Belgium national team – each making excellent tackles on him in the early running. Eric Dier, Tottenham’s third centre-half, also stretched into a saving slide challenge on Tom Davies in the 13th minute.\n\nTottenham's new stadium: the changing face of White Hart Lane – in pictures Read more\n\nHowever, like Kane, Lukaku needs only a sniff of a chance and he got it when the otherwise outstanding Vertonghen got his feet in a mess as he backpedalled following Mirallas’s ball forward and slipped over. Lukaku raced through to ram a low shot past Hugo Lloris and a finale that had scarcely been trailed was set up.\n\nAlli had headed straight at Robles earlier in the second half while Vertonghen was denied by the goalkeeper after a storming run upfield and, when Kane fluffed his dinked finish when clean through – Robles saving well – Everton could dream of snatching a point.\n\nAlli’s goal put the result beyond doubt and it followed a piece of quick thinking by the substitute Harry Winks. Rather than seek to run down the clock, he lofted a free-kick into the area for Alli, who touched a flick with the outside of his boot into the far corner. Valencia had the last word, when he stole in to convert from Séamus Coleman’s free-kick – after a Tottenham defensive breakdown.

Unfortunately for Sunderland, Manchester City proved similarly mercurial and almost equally elusive – not to mention hungry – on an afternoon when the excellent David Silva and friends left David Moyes’s players chasing shadows.\n\nWell before the final whistle accomplished finishes from Sergio Agüero and Leroy Sané nudged the bottom-placed Wearsiders closer to the Championship. Six points shy of 17th-placed Crystal Palace, Moyes’s horizon looks almost as grim as Guardiola’s is bright.\n\nA seventh win in eight games in all competitions ensured the Spaniard’s team moved up to third, eight points behind the leaders, Chelsea. Although City’s title chances seem purely mathematical, fears they could end the campaign outside the top four appear thoroughly assuaged amid newly upbeat mood music.\n\n“I’m delighted because these are often the most difficult types of games,” said Guardiola, who embraced every City player at the end – with a special hug reserved for Silva. “I know the players better and they know me better now. I’m feeling we’re now playing quite good and that’s why we’re making results.”\n\nMoyes recently attended City’s 5-3 Champions League game against Monaco and was so impressed that he likened Guardiola’s side to “a finely tuned orchestra”. The Scot readily concedes his own team – and redundancy-hit club – are “gasping for air” but Sunderland started promisingly enough here. In full‑on spoiling mode they closed City players down at every opportunity with Didier Ndong initially making a fine job of, at times, pressing a slightly affronted looking Yaya Touré into submission and Jermain Defoe striking a post.\n\nSensing opportunity 25 yards out, the former England striker swivelled sharply before anyone could shut him down and unleashed a dipping, first-time shot which bounced in front of a wrong-footed Willy Caballero before hitting the base of the upright.\n\nFabio Borini headed wide from the rebound when he might have rewarded his team-mates’ impressive intensity but, despite all this commendable effort and temporary success in reducing City to scrappiness, Sunderland remained far too slapdash, consistently forfeiting possession much too cheaply.\n\nAlthough Jordan Pickford – Moyes’s highly coveted young goalkeeper and a player who may interest Guardiola in the summer – had surprisingly little to do in the first half he watched in horror as Sané deceived Billy Jones only for the youngster to overhit his cross. It left Silva, unattended and waiting for what seemed a simple tap disbelieving, but such disappointment did not endure.\n\nShortly afterwards Touré switched into dynamic mode, mopping up a poor clearance from Caballero – whose kicking was not great – and powering up‑field before setting Raheem Sterling up for a run and low cross. Having taken a slight deflection that centre was dinked, adroitly, beyond Pickford by Agüero with the hovering Lamine Koné thoroughly confounded.\n\nThat most subtle flick of Agüero’s boot represented both City’s first shot on target and a crunching blow in the solar plexus for Moyes who, until then, must have been cautiously satisfied about Jones’s attacking success against Gaël Clichy and would have been heartened to see the right-back twice come close to scoring from corners. It could have been worse for Sunderland’s manager as Silva believed he had scored on the brink of half-time only to see his “goal” disallowed for an offside against Sterling.\n\nEarly in the second half Pickford showed off enviable reflexes, saving well from Silva but, undeterred, Guardiola’s captain, simply manoeuvred himself into space, met a through ball, changed pace and advanced rapidly before playing in Sané.\n\nSunderland v Manchester City: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nDisplaying coruscating pace, Sané burnt off Jones – who had otherwise played so well – before beating Pickford with a shot which went in off the inside of the far post. It was his sixth goal from eight first XI attempts on target.\n\n“Sané’s so fast when he runs in behind defenders,” said Guardiola, who is seeing his £37m summer gamble vindicated. “We’re so satisfied. He was expensive before but cheap now.” Team-mates rightly rushed to congratulate the former Schalke04 winger but on a day when his dribbles helped undo Sunderland, Silva’s role should not be underestimated. “David’s fantastic, a fighter,” said an approving City manager, who could also reflect on some reassuring defensive solidity from Aleksandar Kolarov.\n\nLocals streamed towards the exits as their City counterparts serenaded Guardiola but at least Moyes’s players refused to accept it was all over. Indeed Seb Larsson, Koné and Adnan Januzaj all might have scored before Defoe briefly believed he had capitalised on City’s dead ball vulnerability by heading in a corner only to see it ruled out for offside.\n\nAt the other end, Pickford enjoyed better luck, leaving Guardiola sitting up and taking notice after saving brilliantly from Agüero.\n\n“We tried to stop City and my players gave everything but we were under so much pressure,” a defiant Moyes said. “If we keep playing like this, though, we’ve a good chance of staying up."}, {"date": "04/03/2017", "arena": "Old Trafford",

the chance to end their 138-day stay in sixth place and Bournemouth secured a spirited draw to arrest the perception they are in freefall. Facts, though, do not provide the entire picture on an afternoon of controversy. Its consequences could be considerable, and not just if they cost United Champions League football.\n\nZlatan Ibrahimovic claims Tyrone Mings ‘jumped into my elbow’ Read more\n\nA game of compelling drama may yet be reviewed by the FA. If so, Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s missed penalty could prove his last major contribution in domestic football for a month. The profligate Swede had an off day; indeed, it was a day when he might have been sent off for the first time as a United player, but the 14th in his career. He also could have required medical treatment or been the match-winner. Much revolved around him, in contentious and yet inconclusive fashion. Ibrahimovic was sinner and sinned against, elbowing Tyrone Mings after being stamped on by the Bournemouth defender.\n\nIt summed up an anarchic affair that neither was expelled by the referee Kevin Friend, who dismissed two others for seemingly lesser offences. He seemed to forget he had booked Andrew Surman twice before eventually brandishing a red card. He also sent Bournemouth’s assistant manager, Jason Tindall, to the stands for protesting on the pitch at half-time as well as awarding two penalties and giving the sense he was guessing after losing control of the game.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Zlatan Ibrahimovic clashed with Tyrone Mings shortly after the Bournemouth defender appeared to stamp on the striker. Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAlbeit unwittingly, he upstaged Artur Boruc, who delivered a masterclass in defiance. Bournemouth’s mercurial goalkeeper was culpable for Gareth McAuley’s winner for West Bromwich Albion last week. He made amends in magnificent fashion and, if the headline save came when pushing Ibrahimovic’s spot-kick to safety, the Swede, Wayne Rooney, Anthony Martial and Paul Pogba could all offer other evidence of his excellence.\n\n“Boruc made an amazing performance,” said José Mourinho. Opposing goalkeepers have shown a propensity to prosper at Old Trafford this season and Boruc’s display carried echoes of Tom Heaton’s brilliance for Burnley on an afternoon to stir unwanted memories for United of frustrating home draws.\n\n“The story of creating lots of chances but not scoring goals is old but applies perfectly in these matches,” said a rueful Mourinho. “Against Hull, Burnley, Bournemouth, Stoke, the reality is that we are losing too many points at home.”\n\nHe was in reflective mood, the firebrand who courted trouble in autumn blaming his charges instead. “In the second half, we lost quality and vision,” Mourinho said. “We played phenomenal in the first half and should have been winning 3-0 or 4-0. It ended 1-1. Who can I blame? Ourselves. Nobody else. We missed big chances.”\n\nA rout was threatened, yet the only initial chaos was in the Bournemouth back four. They ended up defending defiantly, clinging on to just their third point of 2017, but they could have been two goals adrift after four minutes. It ranked as a surprise that it took United 23 minutes to break through, when a defender showed a striker’s predatory instincts. As Antonio Valencia miscued his shot, Marcos Rojo reacted, redirecting it beyond Boruc for his first Premier League goal.\n\nManchester United 1-1 Bournemouth: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nBut the sense United’s problems can be self-inflicted surfaced when a ring-rusty Phil Jones, making his comeback after six games out, tripped the sharper Marc Pugh. Josh King, granted only 14 minutes during his two cameos as a United player, converted the resulting penalty.\n\nThen the excitement escalated. Mings trod on Ibrahimovic; accidentally, he claimed. From the subsequent corner, the Swede, who had already been cautioned, elbowed the defender; unintentionally, he claimed. Surman, the other man booked before, pushed the striker, although not with sufficient force to send a man of his size tumbling in such melodramatic fashion.\n\nIt was nevertheless deliberate and Friend responded by showing a yellow card to Surman and lecturing Ibrahimovic. Then, when he seemed set to repeat Graham Poll’s infamous error in the 2006 World Cup when he booked Josip Simunic twice while allowing him to stay on the pitch, Friend belatedly gave the Bournemouth captain his marching orders, albeit after a 160-second hiatus when he appeared to be reminded by both Rooney and his officiating colleagues.

After two wins in the space of a week, Craig Shakespeare can head to Dubai with the Leicester City players for their warm weather training camp fully expecting to be given the news that he will remain in charge for the remainder of the season. Claudio Ranieri’s former assistant has done everything that has been asked of him and more and it would be a strange decision to look elsewhere now that Leicester have remembered how to win football matches.\n\nVichai Srivaddhanaprabha, the chairman, and Aiyawatt, his son and vice-chairman, were in the directors’ box on a day when Leicester played with spirit and belief to record back-to-back Premier League wins for the first time this season. It was also the first time in this campaign that Leicester have won a match after falling behind. The turnaround was indicative of the newfound confidence and resilience in a group of players who appear liberated.\n\nFernando Llorente’s late header gives Swansea vital win over Burnley Read more\n\nRiyad Mahrez is a case in point. The Algerian produced a moment of brilliance here to score his first league goal from open play since April. Christian Fuchs, another who had toiled under Ranieri, had equalised for Leicester and any hopes Hull had of salvaging something from this game were extinguished when Tom Huddlestone headed into his own net in the 90th minute, leaving Marco Silva’s side second bottom and four points adrift of a safe position.\n\nLeicester’s transformation since Ranieri’s dismissal may sit uncomfortably with some, yet the fact is that the Italian had got things wrong this season with his tactics and his team selections. Shakespeare has gone back to the Leicester of old, with Shinji Okazaki restored to the starting lineup and the players encouraged to press aggressively high up the pitch.\n\nThe rewards have been there for all to see. In the bottom three before the victory over Liverpool on Monday night, Leicester are now five points clear of the relegation zone and the optimism around the club is almost tangible. The game finished with the home supporters singing Shakespeare’s name, big smiles in the directors’ box and huge cheers greeting the final whistle.\n\nCrystal Palace defeat West Brom as Sam Allardyce’s side get physical Read more\n\nFor Leicester’s owners there must be a sense of vindication as well as relief, with the club now under no pressure to pursue Roy Hodgson or any of the other candidates they had spoken to in the wake of sacking Ranieri. Shakespeare has the backing of the fans as well as the players and it would be a risky policy to bring in someone else and risk disrupting the feelgood factor that has returned.\n\nNot that Shakespeare is going to start shouting from the rooftops about his prospects. The 53-year-old answered questions with the straightest of bats after his latest success. “I was told the remit was the Liverpool game and then Hull,” he said. “I’ve been told now – and I’m quite comfortable with it – that we’ll have a talk towards the end of the week. I’m more pleased about the results than anything else.”\n\nHull, in contrast, are in deep trouble. Although they took the lead through Sam Clucas, who started and finished a counterattack that stemmed from Wilfred Ndidi giving the ball away deep inside the Leicester half, that came against the run of play and the visitors looked vulnerable defensively throughout. A gap has now opened up at the bottom and next Saturday’s home match against Swansea appears critical in terms of their survival prospects. “The numbers are not good for us, that is clear,” Silva said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Hull City’s Tom Huddlestone reacts after his own goal secured victory for Leicester. Photograph: Steven Paston/PA\n\nLeicester’s equaliser arrived shortly before the half-hour mark, following a lovely move down the left flank involving Fuchs and Jamie Vardy. The pair swapped passes a couple of times before Vardy darted into the area and cut the ball back for Fuchs, who hit a right-foot shot from 10 yards that seemed to go through the Hull goalkeeper, Eldin Jakupovic.\n\nHarry Maguire had two good chances to restore Hull’s lead shortly after the restart, his first effort hitting the outside of a post and the second saved by Kasper Schmeichel. That was the cue for Mahrez to take centre stage. Twisting and turning on the edge of the Hull area, Mahrez showed some lovely footwork to leave Andrew Robertson totally disorientated. Having created a yard of space with a neat Cruyff turn, Mahrez drilled a 20-yard shot that flashed inside Jakupovic’s near post.\n\nOumar Niasse forced Schmeichel into a decent save late on but Huddlestone’s own goal moments later put the outcome beyond doubt and allowed Leicester to celebrate a rare comeback win. “I’ve just reminded the players of that,” Shakespeare said. “To go 1-0 down in the manner we did, on a counterattack … we showed great character and resilience to bounce back.”"}, {"date": "04/03/2017", "arena": "Bet365 Stadium", "attendance": 27644, "home_team": {"name": "Stoke

After this tepid defeat that is exactly where they are. He may need to start discussing it now.\n\n“We’re a newly promoted team in the bottom three for the first time in March, which means we’re doing something well,” he said in a valiant attempt to put a positive spin on a desperate afternoon for Boro.\n\nMarko Arnautovic scored both goals for Stoke, who were nowhere close to their best but they still easily beat a bloodless Boro side who have now gone 423 minutes without scoring a league goal and have not won in the league since the middle of December. Some travelling fans called for Karanka’s departure (shouted down by others), but he was adamant that he would stay. “I will leave when the chairman says,” he said.\n\nSouthampton beat Watford in seven-goal epic as Nathan Redmond scores twice Read more\n\nFor Stoke, this was the sort of performance that was required following the 4-0 defeat by Tottenham last Sunday, which led to the chairman, Peter Coates, to suggest the players were still on the beach after their mid-season break in Dubai.\n\n“We usually bounce back,” said Mark Hughes, whose only disappointment was the relative closeness of the scoreline. “With a little bit more care in the final third, we could have won more comprehensively. But we’ll take 2-0.”\n\nStoke took the lead in the 29th minute when Glenn Whelan looped a pass into the area from deep, Arnautovic took it down with a David Silva-esque left-foot touch, inched expertly around the keeper and then forced the ball home with his right, splicing two defenders on the line as they desperately tried to block.\n\nA second came just before the break, this one distressingly simple from Boro’s perspective. Whelan skimmed over a corner from the right, Peter Crouch nodded it back and Arnautovic simply hooked it home from inside the six-yard box. The player that came closest to denying the Austrian his second was his team-mate Ryan Shawcross, who was also trying to score, which summed up just how bad Boro’s defending was from the corner.\n\nBoro’s fans, who were broadly supportive for much of the first half, implored their side to “attack, attack, attack” and offered a mixture of boos and frustrated howls of encouragement as the players trudged off at the break.\n\nGallows humour increasingly crept in as the game progressed with the bleak lament: “What’s it like to score a goal?” and the exclamatory: “We’ve had a shot!” when Adlène Guedioura fired over from the edge of the area. Support remains for the manager, but it seems to be eroding.\n\nKaranka attempted to shake his team from their stupor by bringing on Cristhian Stuani for the anonymous Gastón Ramírez at half-time, a ploy that looked to have paid almost instant dividends when Ben Gibson found the net from a Grant Leadbitter free-kick, but Bernardo Espinosa had strayed carelessly ahead of him into an offside position. That was the closest the visitors came to scoring.\n\nStoke nearly added a third through Ramadan Sobhi, then Ibrahim Afellay also went close to increasing the lead. But in the end, two was plenty. “We’d love to dominate for 90 minutes, but maybe we haven’t quite got the capacity to do that yet,” said Hughes.\n\nThe win pushed Stoke up one place to ninth, but Crystal Palace’s win over West Bromwich Albion pushed Boro into the relegation zone.\n\n“There are a lot of problems, not just one,” said Karanka. “If it was just one, I would have fixed it. It’s more than one, more than two, more than three.”\n\nHe could have kept talking on that track for a while.

But the game’s main talking point centred on the 20th-minute penalty that Anthony Taylor awarded Burnley even though television replays showed it was the Clarets striker Sam Vokes who had handled the ball.\n\nMarko Arnautovic at the double for Stoke to sink hapless Middlesbrough Read more\n\n“I spoke to him [Taylor] at half-time and he said he made what was in his opinion an honest decision,” said Clement. “I don’t think it would be any other way. It was clearly a mistake.\n\n“I realised 30 seconds after the incident what had happened. Someone told me from the backroom staff, who were able to see it.”\n\nAsked whether video technology should be introduced for such incidents, the Swansea head coach added: “I’d 100% welcome it. I don’t understand why it’s taking so long, it’s been spoken about for years and years.\n\n“I feel for referees. I referee in training and sometimes I guess and sometimes I go off the reaction of the players. What is bizarre is the referee, the assistants and fourth official are the only people in the stadium who do not have the help they need.\n\n“Media have got it, technical staff can get it, fans have got it real-time on their mobile devices. The only one who doesn’t get the help is the one who needs it the most.”\n\nIn a seesaw game, Swansea’s fast start was almost rewarded when they struck the woodwork twice in the same 11th-minute attack. Alfie Mawson headed Gylfi Sigurdsson’s free-kick against the crossbar and, following some pinball in the Burnley penalty area, the centre-back was denied for a second time when his shot cannoned back off a post.\n\nZlatan Ibrahimovic claims Tyrone Mings ‘jumped into my elbow’ Read more\n\nA minute later Llorente gave Swansea the lead before Andre Gray’s controversial leveller from the spot. Gray then fired Burnley ahead just after the hour mark, but Martin Olsson equalised before Llorente struck for the 11th time this season to secure a vital three points for Swansea in the battle against relegation.\n\n“I’m not sure there is a better player in Europe at attacking crosses, and I’ve worked with some good ones,” Clement said. “That’s some key goals Fernando has come up with now. There was the header against Liverpool and now this one.\n\nHe has a hand in goals too, he’s put in some great assists. But he gets big help from the team too, they put some fantastic deliveries in for him today.”\n\nSean Dyche was also angry with Taylor as he insisted that Llorente’s winner should not have stood. The Spanish striker rose above Ben Mee at the far post but Dyche felt that he had done so illegally.\n\n“The one at the end is a foul,” said the Burnley manager. “We see that given in the Premier League, to have a hand that big in your back. So we’re coming away frustrated with a decision at the end. I thought they were the better side and we would have nicked a good point today.”\n\nBurnley remain nine points clear of the bottom three and are probably two wins from safety. But Dyche said: “I’m more interested in the performances.

his hot streak.\n\nThe Saints responded to their EFL Cup final loss to Manchester United with a win that featured Gabbiadini’s sixth goal in four games since his move from Napoli.\n\nGabbiadini scored twice at Wembley and had another ruled out, incorrectly in Puel’s opinion, for offside. The manager said: “It was difficult for him today. He played against three centre-backs. The next time it will be four centre-backs, but he continues to score. It’s important. He scored seven goals – three goals against Manchester.\n\n“It’s fantastic work. All this gives good confidence for the team. It’s important to continue this way.”\n\nNathan Redmond scored twice – his first Premier League goals since October – and Dusan Tadic was also on target for Saints. Redmond could be called up for England’s matches with Germany and Lithuania this month.\n\n“It was time. I’m happy for Nathan,” Puel said. “Nathan doesn’t score a lot of goals and he has all the qualities for this. I hope these two goals give him confidence for the future. He can become a strong striker for the national team. For the moment it’s important he continues his work and continues to make progress.”\n\nPuel praised his players’ response to the Wembley disappointment, but lamented the lack of forthcoming action. Saints’ previous Premier League game was the 4-0 win at Sunderland on 11 February and their next is at Tottenham on 19 March.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Troy Deeney gives Watford an early lead at Vicarage Road.

This is difficult to keep a good attitude and good intensity in training sessions.”\n\nFernando Llorente’s late header gives Swansea vital win over Burnley Read more\n\nGabbiadini’s goal came after Stefano Okaka had levelled the contest at 2-2 with 11 minutes to go.

We are a whole team and in these cases I don’t say anything.”\n\nTroy Deeney had given Watford a fourth-minute lead with his 100th league goal for the club. Mazzarri said: “It’s a pleasure for Troy for sure and we’re happy for him. Even he would’ve liked that his goal would’ve brought one point or three points for the team.”\n\nThe Hornets also have two weeks until their next game against Crystal Palace.\n\nThe Italian warned his side could yet be dragged into the relegation battle. “I don’t want in the head of my players that they are already safe from relegation.”"}, {"date": "04/03/2017", "arena": "The Hawthorns",

physical, clinical football that gave Crystal Palace another vital three points in their fight against relegation.\n\nTwo second-half goals, the first an instant control and finish by Wilfried Zaha, the second a composed one-man counterattack by Andros Townsend, did what West Brom have done to many other sides this season. It need hardly be pointed out however that it is also a habit Allardyce has fostered over his long career as a Premier League manager.\n\n“It’s the start of recovery I would say,” Allardyce argued after the match. “We’ve got back-to-back wins and the performance was good both in and out of possession. What we did out of possession gave us the platform and then we’ve been asking for an addition of quality in the final third and that came today with two moments of outstanding quality. Andros’s goal is the top goal of our season so far and I don’t think anyone will beat it. That win is a great lift for us all. We’ve got the basics in place and we kept their crowd quiet.”\n\nThat was not strictly accurate. The crowd was noisy as both set of fans exchanged opposing opinions on the merits of Tony Pulis. The Baggies manager had done his level best to add spice to the occasion, making detailed observations before the match about the money Palace had spent in seasons since he left the club, amounts that looked at odds with their current league position. He had also refused to confirm whether he had paid the £3.7m fine he owed the club for cashing in a loyalty bonus shortly before he resigned from Selhurst Park. “We’re having your house, oh Tony Pulis, we’re having your house,” sang the away support. The Smethwick end matched them lung for lung with “Tony Pulis, we’ve got … Tony Pulis‚” to the tune of Palace’s Glad All Over.\n\nRiyad Mahrez revives the old magic as renewed Leicester sink Hull City Read more\n\nSuch noises may or may not have piqued Allardyce, but he insisted his players knew nothing of what their former manager had said. Instead he praised his players for finally sloughing off the anxiety he claims has been haunting their performances so far this season, with the previous Saturday’s 1-0 win over Middlesbrough only the second of Allardyce’s tenure. This week there was no mistaking that Palace were a Big Sam side: strong in the challenge, effective in the cross, every player looked a good 2% stronger than they did a month ago (which, according to Sam’s maths in last week’s Palace programme, ought to make them 22% stronger as a whole).\n\nAfter defending stoutly for much of the first half, Palace hit Albion with a sucker punch five minutes into the second. Yohan Cabaye received the ball just inside the Albion half with all the play in front of him. He picked out one of his pinpoint quarterback passes straight to Wilfried Zaha on the far side of the Albion box. The winger took one touch on his chest before finishing low with his left foot into the far corner of the net.\n\nSouthampton beat Watford in seven-goal epic as Nathan Redmond scores twice Read more\n\nPalace sealed the match with five minutes remaining with Townsend’s fine solo effort. It started on the edge of his own area when he robbed the Albion teenager Jonathan Leko, given a rare substitute’s outing by an increasingly desperate Pulis. As Townsend accelerated away on the counterattack. Leko tracked back but was muscled off the ball by the England winger who then threw three stepovers at Gareth McAuley, ran past him and hit another low shot that took a deflection off Jonny Evans and flew past Foster.\n\nTownsend was just one of several rejuvenated figures in the Palace side. Cabaye sprayed his full range of passes since being saved from sitting at the base of midfield by the addition of the Serb Luka Milivojevic. Jason Puncheon rose to the responsibilities of the captaincy, and at the back Mamadou Sakho was superb. The former Liverpool man was cast out from Anfield but held the defensive line at the Hawthorns, making several key interceptions and apparently relishing the physical challenge against Salomón Rondón.\n\nPulis, for his part, did not entirely roll back on his comments, observing that, in Jeffrey Schlupp, Palace have “a £15m substitute left-back. That’s not bad, is it.” He said he could endure whatever chants fans chose to sing at him but claimed his team had dropped from the high standards they had set for much of this season. “We’ve had an off day, it was an off day,” he said. “Players have to understand they really have to be up for it every game. They’ve been fantastic this year and now have to dust themselves down.”"}, {"date": "04/03/2017", "arena": "Anfield", "attendance": 53146, "home_team": {"name": "Liverpool", "lineup": [{"name": "Simon Mignolet", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathaniel Clyne", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joel Matip", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ragnar Klavan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Milner", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Georginio Wijnaldum", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [90], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Emre Can", "yellows": [68], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Lallana", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Sadio Mané", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [40], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Roberto Firmino", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [9], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Philippe Coutinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [80]}], "subs": [{"name": "Loris Karius", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dejan Lovren", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alberto Moreno", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lucas Leiva", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Divock Origi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [80], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Woodburn", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Trent Alexander-Arnold", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Arsenal", "lineup": [{"name": "Petr Cech", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Hector Bellerin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shkodran Mustafi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Laurent Koscielny", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nacho Monreal", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Francis Coquelin", "yellows": [34], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Granit Xhaka", "yellows": [78], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex Iwobi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Welbeck", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [57], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [74]}, {"name": "Olivier Giroud", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [74]}], "subs": [{"name": "Kieran Gibbs", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gabriel Paulista", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alexis Sánchez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Ramsey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lucas Pérez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [74], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Ospina", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Theo Walcott", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [74], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Liverpool extended their impressive record against top-six teams this season by completing a double over Arsenal, leapfrogging the Gunners and moving above Manchester City to third place as a result. Just about the last thing you need when dropping Alexis Sánchez to the bench is to simultaneously drop out of the Champions League positions, and though Arsène Wenger had his head in his hands at various points in another disappointing display he probably owes Eddie Howe a pint for doing him a favour at Old Trafford. But for Bournemouth holding Manchester United to a draw Arsenal would have woken up on Sunday morning in sixth.\n\nArsène Wenger admits he favoured the long ball over Alexis Sánchez Read more\n\nThe intensity that went missing in Liverpool’s defeat at the King Power Stadium on Monday was back in evidence at Anfield, although it could simply be that Jürgen Klopp’s side found these opponents more accommodating than Leicester. The home side could only have been encouraged to discover Sánchez would not be starting and Mesut Özil was not even in the squad, and without that pair Arsenal looked a little laboured going forward. Liverpool did not, and were ahead inside nine minutes. Adam Lallana played Sadio Mané into space on the right, and when the cross came in Philippe Coutinho allowed it to reach the unmarked Roberto Firmino at the far post. He had time to take a touch before lashing a shot into the roof of Petr Cech’s net.\n\nIf conceding early asked a question of Arsenal, they struggled to answer it for the next half-hour. With Coutinho and Lallana working hard to prevent the visitors building from the back, Olivier Giroud and Alex Iwobi were isolated up front and too easily contained, so much so that when Granit Xhaka strode from midfield to waft a speculative effort from distance high into the Kop, the travelling fans in the Anfield Road end could be heard rejoicing that their side had had a shot.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Roberto Firmino rifles home the opening goal. Photograph: Laurence Griffiths/Getty Images\n\nBy that stage Liverpool had managed another attempt on target, Cech’s fingertips diverting a shot from Coutinho over the angle of post and bar, and it was clear Arsenal were having difficulty dealing with the pace and invention of Mané and Firmino.\n\nAlexis Sánchez the substitute symbolises Arsenal’s decade of sorry stagnation | Jonathan Wilson Read more\n\n“We have shown we can work harder than our opponents,” Klopp claimed in his programme notes, presumably to fire up his own players rather than make a point about the opposition’s elegant shirkers. Liverpool’s unselfish work ethic could be seen when they added a second goal before the interval, with James Milner holding up the ball on the left until Georginio Wijnaldum and Firmino arrived to help, each one transferring the ball across the edge of the area until Arsenal’s cover ran out and Firmino’s pass found Mané entirely in space. The winger needed no further invitation than a clear sight of goal to bury a shot into Cech’s bottom corner, and although a two-goal half-time lead was a fair indication of Liverpool’s superiority, Arsenal were actually lucky not to turn round three goals in arrears. Coutinho missed the best opportunity of the half right on the stroke of the interval, when he did well to bring down a ball from the air and hold off Shkodran Mustafi near the penalty spot, only to shank his shot into the arms of a grateful Cech when there was only the goalkeeper left to beat.\n\nTo no one’s surprise Sánchez came on for the second half, and Arsenal immediately looked better. Nacho Monreal sent over a cross from the left and Giroud predictably got his header on target, though Simon Mignolet was able to get a hand to it and push the ball on to the bar. Just before the hour the substitute proved a point of his own when sliding a perfectly weighted pass for Danny Welbeck to run on to and pull a goal back. The goal still took some scoring, and possibly Mignolet got his angles wrong, but Welbeck is adept at making the most of unpromising half chances and he managed to squeeze a shot between goalkeeper and post.\n\nLiverpool 3-1 Arsenal: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nThat livened up the contest no end, and though Mustafi had to make a goalmouth clearance from Coutinho’s low cross Arsenal were beginning to show a greater attacking threat. A strong run by Sánchez was only ended by a challenge that resulted in a booking for Emre Can, before Coutinho shot too high following a sequence of short passes on the edge of the Arsenal area then provided a cross with a free-kick from which Joël Matip should have done much better. Can was lucky to escape a second yellow for a reckless challenge on Theo Walcott, a decision that incensed Xhaka so much the Arsenal man ended up in the book, while at the other end Divock Origi came on and struck a post with a header from Milner’s free-kick.\n\nLiverpool were not exactly hanging on at the end but they did find themselves having to deal with Arsenal pressure, which was not a scenario anyone had envisaged at the interval. Yet just as stoppage time was shaping up to be interesting Liverpool killed the game with a clinical strike, even if Origi looked fractionally offside in the buildup. Lallana did well in the centre to hold the ball and delay his pass, before sending Origi up the right for a cross that Wijnaldum met with a sweet first-time finish.\n\nThere could be no arguing with the scoreline, though equally no knowing what Arsenal might have achieved had they fielded their strongest side from the start. “I have no regrets, I have to stand by my decision,” Wenger said. “Collectively we were good in the second half, just as collectively we were not good enough in the first.”"}, {"date": "27/02/2017", "arena": "The King Power Stadium", "attendance": 32034,

players clearly felt they had a point to prove. Debate will have raged long into the night about what this exhilarating performance says about their players and the club’s decision to sack Claudio Ranieri, yet the only thing that matters for the owners is that the Premier League champions are back.\n\nVichai Srivaddhanaprabha, the chairman, and Aiyawatt, his son and the vice-chairman, will feel a sense of vindication about the controversial call they made to dismiss Ranieri and Leicester, inspired by Jamie Vardy, recorded their first Premier League win of the year to climb up to 15th place in the table.\n\nLeicester were unrecognisable from the side who had been sleepwalking towards the Championship and much more like the all-encompassing team of last season. Vardy scored twice – his first Premier League goals since December – and Danny Drinkwater, another of the stars of the title-winning campaign, chose an opportune time to register his first of the season with a fine shot from outside the area.\n\nJamie Vardy claims ‘unfair’ criticism fired up Leicester City to hit back Read more\n\nOne of the abiding images of the evening, however, came on 65 minutes, when Ranieri’s name was sung with gusto for the first time. Lighting up the stadium with their mobile phones, the home supporters stood to applaud the Italian manager who was gone but not forgotten.\n\nMoments later Philippe Coutinho pulled a goal back but this was never going to be Liverpool’s night. Jürgen Klopp’s team were blown away as soon as Leicester started and on this evidence, that 16-day break without a game did them more harm than good. It was a chastening night for them, in particular Lucas Leiva, who was asked to deputise for the injured Dejan Lovren at centre-half and never gave the impression that he was up to the job.\n\nVardy, back to his best, gave the Brazilian the runaround and on another night could easily have scored a hat-trick. Instead he finished with two goals, just as he did in the corresponding fixture last season, when a Hollywood screenwriter came to watch him for the first time and it seemed as though everything Vardy and Leicester did turned to gold.\n\nIt has been a different story for so much of this season and it was impossible not to wonder what would have been going through Ranieri’s mind as Leicester turned back the clock with a dynamic display that was full of aggressive running, with Wilfred Ndidi catching the eye in central midfield. They pressed high up the pitch – something they have rarely done over the last couple of months – and carried a genuine threat whenever they attacked.\n\nLeicester City v Liverpool: Premier League –as it happened Read more\n\nThe only surprise was that we had to wait until the 28th minute for the opening goal. By half-time, however, Leicester had doubled their lead, Craig Shakespeare was being asked to wave to the home supporters and the club’s owners had big smiles on their face in the directors’ box.\n\nIt was a stunning first half that raises all sorts of questions about the players’ motivation, Ranieri’s tactics and where that performance had been hiding for so long. Shakespeare made the point that Leicester had played with similar verve and conviction against Manchester City under Ranieri, yet this seemed different because of the circumstances.\n\nVardy’s opening goal was Leicester’s first in the Premier League for 638 minutes and owed much to Marc Albrighton’s vision as well as Lucas’s poor defending. Albrighton’s perfectly weighted pass exposed the Brazilian and Vardy did the rest with the minimum of fuss, coolly dispatching a low shot inside Simon Mignolet’s near post.\n\nThat goal had been coming. Shinji Okazaki, restored to the starting lineup, had come close in the sixth minute with a header that Mignolet turned around a post. Robert Huth wastefully headed Albrighton’s corner over the bar and Vardy, after a brilliant first touch that took him around Lucas, should have scored with a left-foot volley that the Liverpool goalkeeper managed to claw away.\n\nLiverpool had threatened only sporadically, although Kasper Schmeichel did make a decent save to smother Coutinho’s shot. Leicester, however, kept coming back for more and scored a second in spectacular style.\n\nJames Milner’s header from Albrighton’s floated centre dropped invitingly for Drinkwater about 25 yards from goal, yet there was still much to admire about the way the midfielder expertly speared a controlled volley into the far corner of the net.\n\nKlopp, not surprisingly, sent Liverpool out early for the second half and for a period the visitors put Leicester under pressure. Yet it was the home team who scored what seemed like the decisive goal of the evening when Vardy struck again on the hour mark. This time the architect was Christian Fuchs, who created a yard of space with a neat turn to dig out a right-foot cross that Vardy met with a superb glancing header.\n\nCoutinho, picked out by Emre Can, beat Schmeichel with a nice finish from 18 yards a few minutes later but there was never going to be a way back for Liverpool, who looked like a team who had feared the worst from the moment Ranieri was sacked.

After the embarrassing exit from the Europa League on Thursday, Tottenham Hotspur eased back into Premier League action by thrashing their most submissive opponents. Mauricio Pochettino’s team had beaten Stoke 4-0 in their two previous meetings and it took only one half for them to reach that score here, as Harry Kane struck three goals before inviting Dele Alli to hit another. If Wembley spooks Spurs, the sight of Stoke City jerseys cheers them right up.\n\nSpurs, in fairness, have clobbered most opponents at White Hart Lane this season, their tally for the Premier League campaign now standing at 11 wins and two draws from 13 matches. But few visitors have been as obliging as Stoke, who, seemingly unrefreshed by a break in Dubai began as if expecting another trouncing. That was a self-fulfilling attitude that made them ideal opponents for a Spurs team eager to reassert their top-team credentials after flopping out of Europe at Wembley.\n\nTottenham Hotspur v Stoke City: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\n“We never really got out of the traps,” admitted Mark Hughes. “We talked about having a bright start but that didn’t materialise for us. Unfortunately we were a little bit too passive. At times we were just a little bit awestruck and had a little bit too much respect for them. Maybe some of the players had scars from the previous performances [against Spurs] but they shouldn’t have because we have been in good form recently.”\n\nThe first sign of Stoke docility came in only the fourth minute, when Christian Eriksen nutmegged Ryan Shawcross in the box and rolled the ball across the face of goal. Fortunately for Stoke there was no Tottenham player there to complete a tap-in but it was not long before Spurs players were infiltrating the area in swarms. Shawcross, for years the most formidable of sentinels for Stoke, was particularly discombobulated and Spurs’ opening goal was a result of his confusion. As the defender tried to tidy up following another incursion by Eriksen in the 14th minute, Kane nicked the ball off him and lashed in a low shot from 15 yards.\n\nPlay Video 1:00 Harry Kane can become a Tottenham 'legend', says Pochettino – video\n\nStoke attempted to stammer a retort and, in fairness, presented a cogent argument in the 24th minute in the form of a flowing move down the left involving Ramadan Sobhi and Erik Pieters. Peter Crouch nearly topped that off with a telling finish from four yards but Hugo Lloris had the last word with a superb save. “If that had gone in it might have stirred us from our slumbers,” Hughes said. Spurs then settled the debate for good.\n\nJan Vertonghen fired a shot against the crossbar following a corner by Eriksen. Moments later Kane was more clinical. His second goal came courtesy of a perfectly executed half-volley from the edge of the area following an outswinging corner by Eriksen. The striker raised his left-leg with the grace of a ballerina and then brought it cracking down like a lion tamer’s whip as he sent a fierce and impeccably controlled low shot into the net.\n\nManchester United v Southampton: EFL Cup final – live! Read more\n\nKane completed his hat-trick five minutes later, this time with Lady Luck joining Eriksen on assist duty. The Dane rolled a free-kick to the striker, whose strike from nearly 30 yards seemed unlikely to worry Lee Grant until it deflected off Crouch and carried on past the nonplussed goalkeeper and into the net.\n\nKane may have had a hat-trick under his belt but he continued to contribute to Stoke’s debagging. He embarrassed Bruno Martins Indi with a cheeky piece of skill before racing towards the box in time added on at the end of the first half. Instead of shooting from a difficult angle he presented Alli with the easy task of stroking the ball into the empty net.\n\nStoke, seemingly dazed by Spurs’ speed and movement, looked like they could do with a break, and perhaps a lie down. They attempted to restore a measure of dignity in the second half, or at least preserve the ruins of it.\n\nPreservation was the name of Pochettino’s game when he withdrew Vertonghen and Toby Alderweireld in the second half amid complaints of slight strains.\n\nSpurs did not over-stretch themselves for the sake of a fifth goal, especially after Kane collided with a post while attempting to convert a header. Alli tried to double his own tally in the final minute but flicked a shot just wide from six yards.\n\nAlli’s overall performance was bright – and unsullied by the sort of tackle that had earned him a red card against Gent on Thursday. Pochettino had words with him after that but would not disclose them here. “They will remain private but you can imagine,” he said before adding with a smile. “I gave him more love than normal. He was very sad and disappointed [after Thursday] but he’s only 20 years old. I will always protect and support him. He’s one of the best young players in the world. Sometimes he can make mistakes but I want him on the pitch.”\n\nThe win lifted Spurs to within 10 points of league leaders Chelsea. “The target is to keep winning and be there if anything wrong happens to Chelsea,” Pochettino said.

Wins like this, in games that are tight for periods but end up appearing comfortable, give the impression this pursuit of silverware has long since become something of a procession.\n\nSwansea could cling to the equaliser they plundered in stoppage time at the end of the first half, courtesy of Gylfi Sigurdsson’s wonderfully arced free-kick from the centre-circle and Fernando Llorente’s emphatic header beyond Thibaut Courtois.\n\nPaul Clement could also point to the non-award of a penalty while the contest was still level early in the second half, Sigurdsson flicking the ball up on to César Azpilicueta’s hand with the referee, Neil Swarbrick, apparently enjoying a fine view of the incident.\n\nBut even the Swansea manager admitted those were isolated incidents, provoking pangs of anxiety amid waves of Chelsea optimism. “On reflection they’ve had a lot more chances, and a lot more of the ball, so probably deserved the victory,” said the former Chelsea No2. “They’ve got a lot of great players. We had to defend really, really well for 90 minutes-plus, and we couldn’t quite do that.”\n\nChelsea did not allow them to. They might have scored after 57 seconds through Pedro, struck the woodwork through Fàbregas, and forced Lukasz Fabianski to block two fine efforts, both from the former Arsenal midfielder. Kanté’s energy and blur of interceptions gave the hosts a relentless momentum, with Swansea pinned back for long periods. As resolute as they were, their game of containment always appeared stretched.\n\nIn the end they were always likely to crack and the goals pilfered by Pedro, whose shot squirmed disappointingly through Fabianski’s grasp, and Diego Costa gave the scoreline a more realistic feel. The striker’s volley was born of Hazard’s trickery and delivery down the flank, teasing space from Kyle Naughton. There was to be no recovery from that.\n\nSwansea need not be too dismayed in defeat, for all that some of those beneath them in the table have started to flicker back into life. Their crucial run of games is still to come, with Burnley, Hull, Bournemouth and Middlesbrough their next four opponents.\n\n“You never want to lose a game, but the performance doesn’t damage our confidence,” Clement said. The fact he has secured as many points – 12 – from his seven games in charge as Swansea managed in their first 19 games is a source of confidence, and better teams than theirs will be sunk at Stamford Bridge.\n\nMichael Keane makes amends for Burnley to rescue point at Hull City Read more\n\nIt is the depth of Chelsea’s options which must deflate opponents. Fàbregas has flitted in and out of the side, swapping opportunities with Nemanja Matic, but dominated this occasion with all the authority of old.\n\nIt had been his goal which set the hosts en route to their win, Tom Carroll’s mistake seized on by Hazard who eventually forced the ball wide for Pedro. He squared into the muddle of bodies loitering near the penalty spot, with Fàbregas taking one touch before calmly stabbing the ball across Fabianski with his second.\n\nHis class would tell with

Not through style or class, but through persistence and perspiration. Little annoys Allardyce more than seeing his team lose a game that they could have drawn by throwing needless caution to the wind, and this was a contest that might have been a goalless grind on another day, but Palace were clinical and professional against opponents whose timidity risks bringing about their downfall.\n\nResilient after Patrick van Aanholt’s goal, Palace earned their second league win under Allardyce and their third at home this season. The prospect of relegation still hangs over them, despite their position a point above the bottom three, but here was compelling evidence of their manager’s skills as a survival expert and, instead, it was Middlesbrough, stodgy and limited, who looked the likelier team to be playing in the Championship next year.\n\nMiddlesbrough’s allergy to goals continues to undermine their defensive organisation. Level with Palace now, Aitor Karanka’s team have not won in the league since 17 December. Even worse, they have scored three times since Christmas. Their dearth of attacking ambition is alarming.\n\nWest Brom’s Gareth McAuley seals fightback against Bournemouth Read more\n\nPalace had done nothing but absorb pure, undiluted, industrial-strength Allardyce since losing to Stoke City a fortnight ago. They had downed pints of Allardyce and dumped four lumps of the stuff in milky cups of tea. For breakfast, the full Allardyce. For lunch, the Big Sam. For dinner, the jumbo Allardyce. The man himself captured the mood in his programme notes: “I would hope to see an uplift in our performance to get a result, but not necessarily a win. We need to respect the point – as I keep reiterating to the players.”\n\nSuch a pragmatic outlook hardly promised a thrilling spectacle, especially with Middlesbrough in town. But while the Allardiet might sound unappealing, Palace have to embrace it. There could be no repeat of their previous home fixture, that shocking 4-0 defeat to Sunderland.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sam Allardyce cuts an animated figure on the touchline at Selhurst Park. Photograph: Hannah McKay/Reuters\n\nSelhurst Park boiled with rage on that grim afternoon, with one supporter even confronting Damien Delaney, a Palace stalwart. Here, however, the home fans gave their team tremendous backing and Palace fed off the wonderful atmosphere in the first half, dominating possession and creating an early chance when Christian Benteke headed straight at Victor Valdés from Van Aanholt’s cross.\n\nThey retreated to the dressing room at half-time with rare applause and cheers ringing in their ears, for they were ahead thanks to a moment of opportunism from Van Aanholt. Palace had lacked conviction in the final third, but the Dutchman lifted the tension with a messy goal in the 34th minute.\n\nThe left-back loves to venture forward and he brought an attack to life by finding Yohan Cabaye, who shot from 18 yards out. Bernardo Espinosa deflected the ball into the air and Dani Ayala’s header fell to Van Aanholt, who controlled before taking a swing with his right foot. Valdés could not react in time as the shot bounced through a mass of bodies and inside his left post, earning Van Aanholt his first Palace goal since his arrival from Sunderland last month.\n\nMichael Keane makes amends for Burnley to rescue point at Hull City Read more\n\n“The performance, particularly in the first half, warranted our victory,” Allardyce said. “It was a very important win and a very important clean sheet. We didn’t give them many opportunities to equalise.”\n\nPalace had chances to extend their lead. Jason Puncheon tested Valdés with a fizzing drive as Middlesbrough continued to toil. They are the division’s lowest scorers for a reason and offered little in attack. Mamadou Sakho enjoyed a comfortable debut for Palace in defence.\n\nKaranka replaced the ineffective Álvara Negredo with the height of Rudy Gestede up front at half-time. Yet the service from Boro’s creative players was appalling and Cristhian Stuani spurned their best chance of an equaliser.\n\nMiddlesbrough were uncertain in their 3-4-3 system. Karanka said that his hand was forced by George Friend’s late injury, but a tactical alteration could not excuse their performance.\n\nEven when Palace grew edgy, Boro huffed and puffed and Karanka allowed Adama Traoré little time to influence the game with his fearless dribbling.

Both clubs here on Saturday took the opportunity to get away recently, Everton for a spot of warm-weather training in Dubai and Sunderland for a perhaps ill-advised jolly to New York, yet neither of them looked fresher or more energised by the exercise.\n\nUntil Idrissa Gueye broke the grimmest of deadlocks with a quality strike five minutes from the interval the first half had been one of the stodgiest in memory. Everton just about shaded it but they were so unfocused in their attacks, so predictable going forward, that the crowd began to groan each time a move broke down on the edge of the Sunderland area.\n\nFàbregas and Pedro see off stubborn Swansea as Chelsea stay way out in front Read more\n\nAs half time approached, the team at the bottom of the Premier League were beginning to be encouraged by how little Everton were hurting them, though just when they must have been thinking they might make it to the interval unscathed, two of the home side’s brighter performers combined to spoil David Moyes’ first return to Goodison since he found the Grim Reaper stalking him with Manchester United three years ago.\n\nRoss Barkley was screaming for a ball through the middle but, when Tom Davies looked up from the centre circle, he picked out an even better run from Séamus Coleman. The ever-reliable full-back was behind the Sunderland backline in a flash and from his firmly squared ball into the area Gueye struck an unstoppable shot to beat Jordan Pickford from close to the penalty spot.\n\nGueye is not exactly known for his goalscoring – this was his first for Everton and first in the Premier League – but he could hardly have come up with a more emphatic finish and his contribution must have brightened hundreds of half-time conversations.\n\nIn fact Everton almost managed another in the five minutes that remained before the break, when the impressive Davies thumped a shot against Pickford’s left-hand upright from the edge of the area, though a second goal really would have been famine giving way to feast.\n\nWhile Sunderland continued to play tidily after going a goal down, they also offered little in the way of a goal threat. Billy Jones mistimed a header at a corner to leave Joel Robles in the Everton goal with a simple save and, when Leighton Baines gave the ball away with a misplaced pass, Didier Ndong was far too easily dispossessed by Morgan Schneiderlin.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Everton’s Idrissa Gueye after his goal. Photograph: Peter Byrne/PA\n\nIt was fairly clear that another home goal would secure the points but also apparent that the Sunderland centre-half Lamine Koné was not allowing Romelu Lukaku his usual freedom, while Ademola Lookman was finding it so hard to make an impression he was withdrawn after an hour.\n\nThe Everton manager, Ronald Koeman, sent on Enner Valencia in an attempt to give the visitors’ defence more to worry about but, when he attempted to meet a Coleman cross he succeeded only in putting off the better placed Barkley.\n\nAfter a period in which Koeman could be seen getting increasingly agitated on the sidelines as Sunderland inched closer to at least setting up a position for an equaliser, the crux of the game arrived around 10 minutes from the end. First Lukaku brought a fine save from Pickford with his first real effort of the afternoon, then Sunderland’s chance finally arrived when Adnan Januzaj found Jermain Defoe in the Everton box, only for the striker’s shot to bounce downwards from the crossbar and out off the line, Geoff Hurst-style.\n\nThe buzz of debate was still going round the stadium when Barkley sent a pass down the right wing for Lukaku to chase and, once he found himself up against Bryan Oviedo rather than Koné, the result was inevitable. If it was not one of Lukaku’s prettier goals it was at least the type of opportunity few other forwards would have been able to accept. Lukaku showed speed, strength and determination in homing in on goal, as well as the ability to force the ball past Pickford.\n\nBoth managers agreed that Defoe’s chance might have proved crucial. “We were a bit too comfortable at that point, we had dropped the intensity again,” Koeman said. “They only had one dangerous moment but we were lucky it was not 1-1.”\n\nThat is turning into the story of Sunderland’s season. If they are going to create only one chance per game, it is important it is taken and, though Defoe is usually reliable, he is not infallible.\n\n“We were poor in the first half and I told the lads we needed to be a bit braver,” Moyes said. “I thought we were and I thought Jermain’s shot might have been in but obviously it wasn’t.\n\n“This is a tough place to come and get a result but we still have 12 games and we are not that far away,” he added as Sunderland slipped to three points from safety. “I’m looking forward to a good run. I’m sure we have got one to come because a few other teams have had theirs.”"}, {"date": "25/02/2017", "arena": "KCOM Stadium", "attendance": 20156, "home_team": {"name": "Hull City", "lineup": [{"name": "Eldin Jakupovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Omar Elabdellaoui", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [82]}, {"name": "Andrea Ranocchia", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Maguire", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andrew Robertson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alfred N'Diaye", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Huddlestone", "yellows": [53], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [72], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ahmed Elmohamady", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shaun Maloney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [67]}, {"name": "Kamil Grosicki", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dieumerci Mbokani", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [67]}], "subs": [{"name": "David Meyler", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [67], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Abel Hernandez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [82], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adama Diomande", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Marshall", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Oumar Niasse", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [67], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Josh Tymon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jarrod Bowen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Burnley", "lineup": [{"name": "Tom Heaton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matthew Lowton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Keane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [76], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Mee", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stephen Ward", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "George Boyd", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Westwood", "yellows": [40], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [85]}, {"name": "Joey Barton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robbie Brady", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [89]}, {"name": "Ashley Barnes", "yellows": [71], "reds": [90], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andre Gray", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [85]}], "subs": [{"name": "Jon Flanagan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sam Vokes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [85], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paul Robinson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Tarkowski", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [85], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tendayi Darikwa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daniel Agyei", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Scott Arfield", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [89], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "This was not the result Marco Silva will have wanted in Hull City’s bid to avoid relegation.

Hull are level on points with the managerless champions, who play Liverpool on Monday.\n\nFàbregas and Pedro see off stubborn Swansea as Chelsea stay way out in front Read more\n\n“When you prepare the team to win of course you want more,” said Silva, who was without a number of players including Lazar Markovic, Sam Clucas and two centre-halves. “I’m a little bit disappointed with the result but this is football. In tough games like this against Burnley, when one team plays direct balls, it comes down to individual duels during the game.\n\n“We had chances during the 90 minutes. We showed good balance in some moments. We scored first but after we lost our focus – we need to keep our focus through the whole game. Next is Leicester, I understand they are close to us in the table but it’s just one more game. We need to continue working.”\n\nHarry Maguire epitomised Hull’s renewed spirit under Silva, injuring his knee in the first half but playing on in discomfort regardless. Huddlestone was also a standout player but Burnley were good value for their point, defending well and capitalising on some sloppy defending to equalise almost immediately after going behind.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Tom Huddlestone gives Hull City the lead from the penalty spot. Photograph: Michael Mayhew/Sportsphoto Ltd/Allstar\n\nKamil Grosicki and Ahmed Elmohamady had half-chances before the interval but the closest either team came to an early goal was when Ben Mee met Robbie Brady’s deep free-kick with a header on the run, only for Eldin Jakupovic to tip the ball onto the crossbar and somehow scramble it behind.\n\nThe first clear opportunity came in the 59th minute and went Burnley’s way following Ashley Westwood’s fine lofted ball over the home defence for Andre Gray, but the striker dragged his shot inches wide of Jakupovic’s right-hand post. Moments later Grosicki almost scored a brilliant goal, curling an effort that flew just past the post after a slick Hull move.\n\nAfter that, Silva’s men did not have to wait too long for the opener. Hull won a corner down their left and when the ball was swung in it ricocheted into the arm of Keane. Martin Atkinson pointed to the spot and Huddlestone stepped up to convert.\n\nDavid Moyes suffers miserable return to Everton with Sunderland defeat Read more\n\nIf Keane felt aggrieved at the decision, he soon made up for it. Four minutes after conceding, Burnley earned a corner and Brady’s deep cross found him at the far post, the defender lashing the ball low past Jakupovic.\n\nOf the penalty decision, Dyche said: “It’s a harsh one but it’s hard for the referee. When I saw it back Keane goes with his head and Maguire actually pushes his arm on to the ball, not deliberately, but he hasn’t thrown his arm to handball it. But how do you define that for a referee in a millisecond? It’s a tough one to call.\n\n“There was good resilience and good defending overall, Hull had a couple of moments but not many. I’m really pleased with the mentality of the players because a lot is made of our away record but there’s no fear there. We were more than ready to take on the challenge. All the noise from last week goes away immediately.”"}, {"date": "25/02/2017", "arena": "The Hawthorns", "attendance": 24162, "home_team": {"name": "West Bromwich Albion", "lineup": [{"name": "Ben

Bilic said. “We told them at half-time we could definitely raise our level and play with more confidence. The second half was one of our better performances this season.\n\n“We deserved the equaliser and in my opinion we deserved to win but as we played the last 10 minutes with 10 men, they used their physical strength and could have won it.”\n\nWest Brom’s Gareth McAuley seals fightback against Bournemouth Read more\n\nDeeney opened the scoring with his eighth goal of the season and his third spot-kick after Mauro Zárate had been fouled by Cheikhou Kouyaté.

It was a cautious move that, combined with Bilic’s encouragement, simply invited West Ham to go at Watford, which they did.\n\nMazzarri said he made the decision for tactical reasons to counter numbers in the West Ham midfield, but also because he believed his substitute striker Isaac Success was unable to last even 45 minutes.\n\n“In games like today, anything can happen,” Mazzarri said. “With the substitution my thinking was that we were one up and they were pushing us in midfield so I chose to add a player there.

With Andy Carroll out with a groin injury (he is expected to return to full training next week), Antonio, the England international who has played at least four different positions for Bilic this season, was selected as a lone frontman and terrorised the Watford defence.\n\nIn the first half he was in effect playing by himself, contesting high balls, running the channels, breaking with the ball down the wing. “Antonio was our best player,” Bilic said. “But he can’t get the ball, run down the wing and cross it to himself.

But three minutes later he broke an impossibly high Watford line to run on to Manuel Lanzini’s through ball and burst forward on to goal.\n\nWith Younès Kaboul trailing in his wake, Antonio let off a rocket of a shot with his weaker left foot which cannoned off both posts before falling to a gleeful Ayew, who turned the ball home.\n\n“If you ask me about Antonio’s performance up front I was really pleased,” Bilic said. “He had a great game, a great game.”\n\nSadly for Antonio, that great game came to an unfortunate end when a deliberate handball, in an attempt to stop a counterattack, led to him receiving a second yellow card.

City will await news of the extent of Jesus’ foot injury, sustained in the early exchanges, but know they have a match-winner who is glad to be back.\n\nAgüero should revel at the prospect of slotting back into this front-line in the weeks ahead. Sané, in particular, was magnificent down the left, was unlucky late on when he belted a shot on to the crossbar. His gliding menace contrasted with Sterling’s scuttling energy on the opposite flank.\n\n“People say we only brought in one guy [Gabriel Jesus] in the January transfer window but, since Arsenal [in mid-December], something has clicked with Sané,” said Guardiola. “He’s shown us a lot of things. He is so fast, and his intensity has helped us a lot, and he is only 20.” His potential is frightening.\n\nIt had been the German who had dumped Smith on the turf while the game was still goalless, his centre reaching Sterling whose shot was deflected by Steve Cook on to a post. Within minutes, however, that pair had combined once again with Sané’s centre flicking off Cook and evading Charlie Daniels at the far post. Sterling lurked unmarked to convert an eighth goal of the season with ease.\n\nThat combination down the flanks, supplied by Silva’s clever slide-rule passes, will propel this team’s late challenge to Chelsea’s dominance at the top. “I thought City were very good and gave a very controlled performance as the away team,” said Eddie Howe. “Our lads gave everything they could, worked incredibly hard, and I can’t ask for anything more. I just felt they were better than us.”\n\nPep Guardiola admits Sergio Agüero could soon leave Manchester City Read more\n\nHowe had no complaints at the referee’s decision to deny Josh King an equaliser after the striker pulled back John Stones in the build-up, and had taken heart from Jordon Ibe’s improved display on a first league start since early November during which the former Liverpool winger almost eased the hosts ahead. Willy Caballero’s outstretched right leg had denied them that privilege.\n\nThis was not the performance of a team nosediving into a relegation scrap, their frenetic energy and urgency deserving of better, and they can go into the remaining fixtures with more optimism. Yet the ill-fortune thrust Bournemouth’s way did reflect that of a team enduring a slump in form.\n\nNo sooner had Howe found relief in the restoration of his first-choice back-line than Simon Francis suffered a hamstring injury. Jack Wilshere then crumpled to the turf clutching his left ankle after blocking a shot from Silva. The grimace on the Arsenal loanee’s face as the midfielder departed just before the interval looked worryingly familiar.\n\nThey will be as anxious about the extent of any damage as City will be over Jesus’ fitness, though at least Bournemouth have time now to lick their wounds before targeting a recovery. City, in contrast, have FA Cup and Champions League ties looming against Huddersfield Town and Monaco. They have moved to within eight points of Chelsea in the championship race, Guardiola still insistent the title is the leaders’ to lose, but their presence leading the chasing pack will keep Antonio Conte on his toes."}, {"date": "12/02/2017", "arena": "Turf Moor", "attendance": 21744, "home_team": {"name": "Burnley", "lineup": [{"name": "Tom Heaton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [],

recently that, having started their latest assignment so impressively, it came almost as a jolt that they could not build on their early lead and increase the sense that it surely cannot be long before the first publicity-ravenous bookmaker announces it is paying out early on the Premier League champions.\n\nBurnley v Chelsea: Premier League - as it happened Read more\n\nIt will still happen, almost certainly, but a lot of credit has to go to a Burnley side who gave the impression at times that they genuinely believed they could register a sixth successive top-division home league win for the first time since Harry Potts’s team were defending their title in the 1960-61 season.\n\nOnly three teams in the Premier League have superior home records to Burnley this season and as Antonio Conte pointed out afterwards, it is easy to see why when Sean Dyche’s side play with this togetherness. Chelsea happen to be one while Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal, second and third respectively, are the others. In those circumstances it still amounts to a useful point for the leaders, particularly when the game was played in the kind of conditions – driving sleet, biting-cold temperature and a difficult pitch, a long way from home – when champions have to show their durability.\n\nConte’s men are now 10 points clear and the first chant of “we’re going to win the league” could be heard from the away end shortly after Pedro had given them a seventh-minute lead. Their next five games comprise Swansea City, West Ham United, Watford, Stoke City and Crystal Palace – five teams positioned ninth or below – and unless something dramatic happens Chelsea should have everything virtually sewn up by the time they meet the two Manchester clubs in April.\n\nPlay Video 0:47 Antonio Conte disappointed as Chelsea draw at Burnley – video\n\nAll the same, Conte’s disappointment was obvious, bearing in mind the amount of second-half possession his team had without managing a single effort on target, together with the way the game had been progressing before Robbie Brady equalised with a peach of a free-kick.\n\nBurnley can also reflect on chances to win the match but there cannot have been many opponents at Turf Moor this season who have moved the ball so quickly and, not that it should bother Conte or his players too greatly, Chelsea demonstrated in the process how absurd it is for their former manager José Mourinho to depict them as a defensive team.\n\nWhat Chelsea do is break at speed on the counterattack, springing from the back to catch out their opponents. That, however, should not be confused as conservatism. The opening goal was the case in point, originating from deep in their own half and featuring a slick exchange of passes involving Gary Cahill, Marcos Alonso and Diego Costa before Victor Moses was suddenly in possession of the ball and running at the Burnley defence. Pedro was sprinting through the middle and it was a perfectly weighted touch to control the pass and give himself the angle to slide the ball past Tom Heaton.\n\nPedro’s quick running and directness was a prominent feature during the early parts of a match in which Chelsea managed 730 passes compared with 297 for their opponents. Yet it was a fine response from Burnley once Nemanja Matic’s 24th-minute foul on Joey Barton had given Brady the chance to show off his dead-ball expertise. Chelsea had four players in their wall – Moses, Alonso, Costa and Matic – but Brady’s left-foot shot went round them all to bend into the top corner of Thibaut Courtois’s net. “A sublime free-kick,” Dyche said, “against a giant of a goalkeeper.”\n\nFor the remainder of the first half, Burnley matched their opponents and had an outstanding chance to score again when Matt Lowton advanced from his right-back position only for his shot to come back off Courtois’s legs.\n\nChelsea, true to form, immediately broke upfield to create an opening of their own but Conte’s men were not alone in knowing the benefits of incisive counterattacking and early in the second half, Andre Gray really ought to have done better with his shot after a quick breakaway had led to David Luiz failing to cut out the through-ball from Ashley Barnes.\n\nAfter that, Burnley had to withstand some concerted pressure, with Barton symbolising what Conte described afterwards as the team’s ability to “destruct”, and seemed reluctant to commit too many players into attack, perhaps wary of leaving themselves vulnerable in the way they had been for Pedro’s goal. This brought Chelsea forward in even more numbers – Conte smiled knowingly when Mourinho’s comments were put to him – and their disappointment must be that they had so much of the ball in and around the home team’s penalty area without creating one outstanding chance.\n\nBurnley now have 29 points at home and if they continue to play with this vigour they will surely beat the 38-point record, set by Ipswich Town and Charlton Athletic in the 2000-01 season, for a newly promoted side over the course of a 38-game Premier League campaign.

The Italian has the “unwavering support” of his board, according to the statement that was released in the week, but there was no sign of a positive response on the pitch as Leicester suffered a fifth successive league defeat – something that has not happened to the reigning English champions since 1956 – on another chastening afternoon for everyone connected with the club.\n\nClaudio Ranieri says he has given Leicester players too many chances Read more\n\nVichai Srivaddhanaprabha had a face like thunder as he looked on from the stands. At one point in the first half the Leicester owner could be seen slowly shaking his head as Swansea City, whose remarkable turnaround under Paul Clement continues, became the latest team to drive a nail into the champions’ coffin.\n\nLeicester are in freefall and, on current form, on course to swap the Champions League for the Championship. Drained of confidence, woeful defensively, pedestrian in midfield and toothless up front, Ranieri’s team are sleepwalking towards the second tier.\n\nThere is so much wrong that it is difficult to know where to start, with so many damning statistics painting such a bleak picture of how things have unravelled for the fairytale team. Leicester are the only club in the top four divisions to have failed to have scored a league goal this year and they have not won away from home in the top flight this season.\n\nThe biggest concern of all for Leicester supporters must be that there is not the slightest hint that they are capable of emerging from this dreadful run. Ranieri suggested that his next move will be a drastic one after he admitted he was guilty of remaining too loyal to the players who led the club to the Premier League title, yet his options are limited when it comes to shaking up things. It was also the sort of talk that felt like the last roll of the dice.\n\nThe days and weeks ahead do not offer much encouragement. Leicester have an awkward trip to Millwall on Saturday in the FA Cup fifth round and four days later travel to Spain to take on Sevilla in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie. By the time they face Liverpool, in their next Premier League match on 27 February, Leicester could well be in the relegation zone, with this latest defeat leaving them only one place and one point above the bottom three.\n\nSwansea, in contrast, are travelling at pace in the opposite direction and it has been extraordinary to witness the way their fortunes have changed since Clement took over as manager. They had 12 points from 19 games and were anchored to the foot of the table when he was appointed. Six matches later and Swansea have doubled their points tally, climbing above Leicester and up to 15th place in the process.\n\nThe astute signings in the January transfer window have helped, yet that should take nothing away from the job Clement has done and his satisfaction was there for all to see at the final whistle as he marched on to the pitch, clenching his fist in front of the jubilant Swansea supporters.\n\nAlfie Mawson, who was outstanding throughout and is looking more and more impressive with every performance, opened the scoring with an exquisite volley in the 36th minute. Robert Huth’s clearance from Gylfi Sigurdsson’s free-kick lacked distance and Federico Fernández headed back across goal to his central defensive partner, who showed superb technique to strike the ball so sweetly past Kasper Schmeichel.\n\nUp until that point the game had been a slow-burner, yet Swansea now had one foot on Leicester’s throat and they were not going to take a step back.\n\nMartin Olsson, one of last month’s new recruits, added a second goal in first-half injury time, when the left-back ran on to a wonderful reverse pass from Sigurdsson, at the end of a lovely move involving Fernando Llorente and Tom Carroll, to beat Schmeichel inside his near post.\n\nLeicester’s off-target Jamie Vardy and Riyard Mahrez conjure a mystery | Jonathan Wilson Read more\n\nRanieri reacted by making two changes at the interval, including bringing on Islam Slimani to play alongside Jamie Vardy. Slimani should have pulled a goal back just after the hour mark but the Algerian, after being released by Riyad Mahrez and running clear on goal, was denied by Lukasz Fabianski, who smothered the striker’s low shot. Slimani just failed to get his head to another chance and when Vardy sliced high and wide later on it kind of summed up Leicester’s day as well as their season.\n\nFor Swansea and Clement, however, everything is looking up. “It was a very pleasing afternoon,” the Swansea manager said. “I thought we well deserved the victory. The goal just before the end of the first half gave us a lot of confidence but 2-0 is never a nice scoreline. I didn’t feel comfortable at any moment. Maybe the players felt more comfortable than me because they really saw it out in a professional manner.

Alexis Sánchez’s opening goal was the result of a clear handball, but it helped to earn the win for his team and end the two-game losing streak that had led to the latest outbreak of angst in these parts, and the latest questions about whether Wenger ought to stay on as the manager beyond the summer.\n\nThe referee, Mark Clattenburg, felt so bad about his failure to spot the handball on 34 minutes that he said sorry to Hull City’s players.\n\n“When we came out for the second half, the referee’s apologised to us and said there was handball,” Andy Robertson, the full-back, said. “He’s obviously looked at it at half-time and seen he was in the wrong. Not many referees admit they’re wrong, so that’s good, but it doesn’t make it any better.”\n\nWenger said, with a smile, that “you face a good storm when you lose two games on the trot at Arsenal”, and all he wanted here was the victory, no matter how it came. “It was more about the mathematics than the brilliance today,” he added.\n\nThere was an anxious edge to the Arsenal performance; the sense that they were hanging on in the second half – at least until Sánchez scored his second goal from the penalty spot in stoppage time. It was the result of another handball and, this time, it was spotted.\n\nSánchez had surged forward and taken the ball around Eldin Jakupovic, who had unwisely bolted from his line, before crossing for the substitute, Lucas Pérez. His header was blocked on the line by Sam Clucas with his arm and, to compound the Hull midfielder’s misery, he was sent off.\n\nArsenal 2-0 Hull City: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nSánchez drilled home the penalty for his 19th goal of the season and Wenger, who was up in the stands as he served the final game of his touchline ban, could exhale.\n\nHull had played with balance and personality, and they created the chances to have taken something, with Oumar Niasse twice denied by Petr Cech. On this evidence, and that of recent weeks, they have enough about them to stay up. But it did little to soothe the sense of injustice that Marco Silva would speak about afterwards.\n\nThe afternoon might have taken a different course had Niasse not been denied by Cech in the 14th minute. There was power behind his header from Kamil Grosicki’s cross and Cech had to be alert to tip the ball over the crossbar.\n\nMoments earlier, Lazar Markovic had robbed Alex Iwobi, surged forward, beaten Laurent Koscielny and crossed the ball low. But it was too far in front of Niasse.\n\nThe breakthrough goal should not have stood, but Hull’s protests went unheeded. Sometimes, there is something to be read into the immediate reaction of players in the vicinity of an incident and those of Hull gestured that the ball had gone in off Sánchez’s hand. The TV replays supported them.\n\nKieran Gibbs’s shot was hacked off the line by Andrew Robertson, after Mesut Özil’s cross had ricocheted off Tom Huddlestone and Sánchez got to the loose ball before Jakupovic. His shot, from point-blank range, was blocked by the goalkeeper, but it looped up, hit Sánchez’s hand, which was raised, and went in.\n\nÖzil was strangely hesitant and out of sync, but Arsenal had created the chances to have gone ahead earlier. Héctor Bellerín, who was passed fit after his concussion against Chelsea last Saturday, worked a one-two with Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain only to slice his shot when well placed; Sánchez jinked inside but dragged wide of the post – a bad miss and he knew it; and Özil skied a left-footed volley from Sanchez’s cross. Theo Walcott also had a shot blocked on 32 minutes.\n\nHull stuck to their game-plan and they refused to be rattled by the unlucky concession. Silva has effected a remarkable uplift since taking over in January and his team’s composure was pronounced. Markovic and Robertson, on the overlap, were dangerous and there were moments when Arsenal were stretched at the back.\n\nHull threatened an equaliser early in the second half, when Markovic drew in Koscielny before blasting away from him and crossing for Niasse. The striker took a touch on his chest and struck powerfully for goal, only for Cech to beat the ball clear.\n\nSilva’s team could also point to the moment when Gibbs, who was the last Arsenal defender, came across to flatten Markovic as he jumped for a high ball. Hull felt that Markovic had an opportunity to get in on goal, but he did not have the ball under control. Gibbs was booked.\n\nSilva made attacking changes in the second half, introducing Evandro and, later, Adama Diomandé, and – with the full-backs pushing forward and Alfred N’Diaye playing as a box-to-box midfielder – Hull put themselves on the front foot. Sánchez was booked for a dive, but, after Diomandé had headed high from a corner, the Chilean would have the last word."}, {"date": "11/02/2017", "arena": "Old Trafford", "attendance": 75301, "home_team": {"name": "Manchester United", "lineup": [{"name": "David De Gea", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Antonio Valencia", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eric Bailly", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Smalling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daley Blind", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ander Herrera", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paul Pogba", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Juan Mata", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [32], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [72]}, {"name": "Henrikh Mkhitaryan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [89]}, {"name": "Anthony Martial", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [60], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [81]}, {"name": "Zlatan Ibrahimovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Wayne Rooney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jesse Lingard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [89], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Carrick", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marcus Rashford", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [81], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sergio Romero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marouane Fellaini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [72], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matteo Darmian", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Watford", "lineup": [{"name": "Heurelho Gomes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Craig Cathcart", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [83]}, {"name": "Younes Kaboul", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sebastian Prödl", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Miguel Britos", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Tom Cleverley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mauro Zárate", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [74]}, {"name": "Etienne Capoue", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "M'Baye Niang", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "José Holebas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Troy Deeney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Adrian Mariappa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Isaac Success", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [83], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Valon Behrami", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Abdoulaye Doucouré", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daryl Janmaat", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stefano Okaka", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [74], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Giedrius Arlauskis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "José Mourinho can appear to have unlikely allies. Anthony Martial is a footballer who, the Portuguese said this month, had only done enough to be on the bench. Mourinho shares initials with Juan Mata, but seemingly little else. However, Manchester United’s revival continued here courtesy of a player he dropped and sold at Chelsea along with another who has been subjected to his policy of confrontational leadership. The pair’s excellence meant Mourinho was content to exchange censure for superlatives.\n\nThis was a rout in everything bar the scoreline and United’s dominance in every other aspect bodes well for their chances of returning to the Champions League. They are mounting their longest undefeated league run since Sir Alex Ferguson’s retirement. “Sixteen games unbeaten is an amazing record,” Mourinho said, and this was a ninth win. Satisfied by victory, even his hints at a persecution complex came couched in compliments for his charges.\n\nJoe Allen’s cool finish adds to Crystal Palace problems as Stoke City win Read more\n\nThe first-half display, he said, was “the kind of football that if, instead of being a Mourinho team, it is somebody else’s team you would say [it is] art. But because it is my team you just say it is very good.”\n\nStyle was allied with substance, courtesy of the scorers. Briefly, this threatened to be another of those occasions when Mourinho laments United’s profligacy and bemoans lost points in an avoidable draw. Mata ensured otherwise, a smiling talisman scoring his ninth goal of the season. Tellingly, United have won eight times when he has struck. The Spaniard brings precision and vision, a delicacy of touch and an elusiveness. Watford packed their side with defenders, including four who are centre-backs by trade, but they were not primed to stop a player who roams between the lines.\n\nNor did Craig Cathcart, the central defender used on the right, fare well against Martial, who accelerated past him at will. “I kept shouting at him to attack the defender,” Mourinho said. It was an illustration of the extra dimensions Martial’s pace and width bring United. Their front four brimmed with menace and, recalled for the first time since he recorded two assists against Wigan, Martial added another in addition to his goal.\n\nSuch productivity should endear him to Mourinho and proved useful as Zlatan Ibrahimovic endured an off-day in front of goal. He assembled a compendium of misses, miscued volleys bookending the game and the strangest miss coming at the end as he hooked the ball away from goal when it appeared easier to head it into the net.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Juan Mata opens the scoring for Manchester United with just over half an hour played in the first half. Photograph: Nigel Roddis/EPA\n\nHe was a reason why United had 14 attempts before the break yet this threatened to be a familiar tale of frustration. United applied pressure but squandered a series of chances and then took a fifth opportunity in six minutes. Henrikh Mkhitaryan was the main culprit, contriving to sky a shot towards the upper tier. Watford’s defiant goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes denied Paul Pogba and, with a point‑blank block, Ibrahimovic. Then Mata released Martial and, when Ibrahimovic missed a flick at the winger’s cross, he was on hand to complete a one-two by tucking in his shot.\n\nMartial’s incisiveness long promised to bring a second. Shortly after half-time he snaked past Cathcart and angled a shot wide. That channel nonetheless proved profitable in a crisp, clinical move. Mkhitaryan combined with Ibrahimovic and the latter supplied the defence-splitting pass. Martial advanced and picked out the near corner of Gomes’s net.\n\nManolo Gabbiadini double helps Southampton thrash sorry Sunderland Read more\n\nHe had been restored to the side, Mourinho suggested, to improve his morale; the demoted Marcus Rashford, he said, did not require the boost selection confers. “Anthony needs that confidence,” he said. “He has worked harder than ever in the last two weeks in the way I like: silence but hard. The Anthony Martial I want is the Anthony Martial of the last two weeks of training.”\n\nThe renaissance of Martial came at Rashford’s expense but, also like Mkhitaryan’s, to the detriment of the captain, who was confined to the bench. The Armenian looks now to have been installed as Mourinho’s preferred No 10. Wayne Rooney’s reign as an automatic starter ended after the defeat against Watford in September and the reverse fixture was another indication of an unused substitute’s decline in status. United flourished without him.\n\n“We started well,” Watford’s manager, Walter Mazzarri, said. They twice threatened to lead, José Holebas coming close with a viciously swerving shot struck and Mauro Zárate attempting an audacious overhead kick.\n\nThe Argentinian later tested David de Gea with a curling free-kick, but United kept a fourth consecutive clean sheet, became the first team to chalk up 2,000 Premier League points and left Mourinho enthusing more about the manner than the numbers.\n\n“When I got the job they were saying at Manchester United you need to play the football in a certain way and I agree,” he said. “In the first half, the football was fabulous.”"}, {"date":

which Middlesbrough equipped themselves relatively well but could not find the telling breakthrough. Aitor Karanka took some satisfaction at his side matching the in‑form Everton but, ultimately, they relied greatly on Victor Valdés and were denied a crucial late victory that could have sparked their season into life.\n\nValdés produced an excellent performance to thwart Romelu Lukaku and Ademola Lookman but Everton were not really at the races on a bitter afternoon on Teesside. Ronald Koeman was pleased to leave with a point but Boro’s paucity in attacking options continues to haunt them; while this was a much-improved overall display the same problems remain.\n\nThere was warm applause at the final whistle but they stay perilously close to the Premier League’s bottom three and without a victory in nine matches.\n\nAdama Traoré was their brightest player and seems to be maturing as the season progresses, while Karanka dismissed concerns about his team’s lack of goals.\n\n“We have competed against one of the best teams in the league,” Karanka said. “We were really organised, the crowd was behind us. It was almost the perfect game apart from the last save by Joel [Robles]. Our last five games have been against teams in the top 10 and we have competed against all of them.”\n\nOn Valdés’s display, he said: “I’m really pleased for him. The first thing I told him when I was trying to convince him [to sign] was that he should be enjoying football again.”\n\nBoro had recently returned from a training camp in Spain, where the weather will have been somewhat milder than this filthy afternoon. Yet as the wind and rain whipped into the Riverside, they did play with a zip and energy that has been missing in recent weeks. Karanka’s men have not won a Premier League match since 17 December, while Everton travelled east in excellent form and fresh from their 6-3 demolition of Bournemouth.\n\nLukaku scored four in that game and should have added to his season tally when a terrible pass from the Boro centre-half Bernardo Espinosa enabled Tom Davies to break free in midfield. He fed in Lukaku and the Belgian had time to drive forward and bear down on Valdés before attempting a low finish from inside the area. However, the goalkeeper turned it away well.\n\nTraoré was Boro’s live wire and he demonstrated nimble feet on the touchline to play a one-two and drive down the left before he was brought down on the edge of the opposition penalty area by Séamus Coleman in the second half. From the resulting free-kick Marten de Roon nodded across goal for Cristhian Stuani who was unmarked in the middle, but the Uruguayan could only head straight at Robles.\n\nOf Lukaku’s chance, Koeman joked: “Maybe it was better to score one less goal last week.

He had summoned the players for a 7am training session the day after the Sunderland humiliation, hired a sports psychologist to get inside players’ minds and watched the Palace chairman, Steve Parish, give them a dressing-room lecture and cancel a planned team excursion to Dubai next week. That all amounted to more of a boot up the backside than an arm around the shoulders and it had something close to the desired effect, as Palace kept Stoke at bay for most of the first half.\n\nLuka Milivojevic, the Serb midfielder given his first start since his arrival next month, was one of only two alterations to the Palace lineup who had started against Sunderland and he had a steadying influence, patrolling just in front of the Palace defence. He subdued Allen for long periods – but not for the whole game.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Crystal Palace’s Andros Townsend (left) looks dejected at the final whistle. Photograph: Mark Robinson/Getty Images\n\nWayne Hennessey, retained as goalkeeper despite recent errors, had an encouraging start, making a strong save from Marko Arnautovic in the ninth minute. Palace bared their teeth for the first and almost last time in the 17th minute, James McArthur heading wide from a cross by Andros Townsend. Patrick van Aanholt then brought a comfortable save from Lee Grant with a long-range trickler.\n\nMostly, however, mediocrity prevailed. So a flourish from Stoke’s Ramadan Sobhi on the half-hour was very welcome, although not for Joel Ward, who was left spinning like a man caught in a revolving door as the 20-year-old Egyptian winger tricked his way past him and clipped a cross to the back post. Allen proved a less than trusty assistant to the young magician on this occasion, heading over from six yards.

But Martins Indi reacted faster than Benteke and nicked the ball away.\n\nPalace continued to look vaguely threatening until, in the 67th minute, Allardyce was assailed by a familiar sense of dismay. After making a smart run into the box from deep, Sobhi collected a delightful pass from Arnautovic, the winger held off a defender and teed up Allen.

On a day when Claude Puel’s side remembered how to concentrate, two goals from the Italy striker along with some splendid support from Dusan Tadic not only ended the visitors’ recent wretched run of results but also ensured David Moyes’s team remain firmly bottom.\n\n“Sometimes when there’s expectations on us to win we can’t handle it,” Sunderland’s manager said. “We’re very disappointed. This was a big opportunity to get out of the bottom three and for the first 25 minutes we played as well as we’ve done all season.”\n\nAlexis Sánchez secures Arsenal and Arsène Wenger respite against Hull Read more\n\nThe other 65 were less impressive, destroying what before the match looked a perfect moment for Moyes’s players to entertain Southampton. Quite apart from Sunderland being fresh from a 4-0 win at Crystal Palace, Puel’s team were supposedly distracted by their impending League cup final against Manchester United - or that was the theory at least.\n\nThey arrived having lost six of their past seven league games and apparently in the throes of a central defensive “crisis” occasioned by José Fonte’s transfer to West Ham, Virgil van Dijk’s untimely ankle injury and the novice Jack Stephen’s elevation to first-team duties.\n\nIdentifying lack of “focus” as the principal problem, Puel refused to buy it and demanded his team started showing some strength of character. Stephens, particularly, rose to the challenge. “It was good,” said Southampton’s beaming manager. “And Gabbiadini showed his quality. He plays between the lines and gives us a very good technical solution.”\n\nEven so, the conditions – icy, driving rain, capriciously swirling wind and freezing temperatures – were not for the faint-hearted, and his players took their time to fathom how to deconstruct Sunderland’s back three.\n\nAccordingly with Didier Ndong initially dynamic and Darron Gibson showing off some elegantly incisive passes on his home debut, Sunderland began brightly. Adnan Januzaj cued up Jermain Defoe for a presentable shooting chance but the former England striker – distracted by Maya Yoshida’s attentions – was let down by an uncharacteristically poor first touch and it drifted wide.\n\nShortly afterwards Sunderland regressed to bad habits and created Southampton’s first chance when, played into trouble by Billy Jones, Gibson panicked and passed straight to Gabbiadini. The former Napoli striker screwed that shot wide but his subsequent wily movement, rapid changes of pace, springing of the offside trap and slick combinations with Tadic should have reminded Moyes’s defence that they ignored him at their peril.\n\nAnthony Martial takes his chance as Manchester United outclass Watford Read more\n\nDespite this warning, they had no answer to Ryan Bertrand’s advance from left-back and perfectly whipped in cross, which preceded the Italian’s second goal in as many games. It was met by a combination of Lamine Koné and Gabbiadini, with the pair attempting diving headers but the defender missing and the ball going in off the forward’s upper arm. “That shouldn’t have been given,” said Moyes, somewhat contentiously.\n\nBefore half-time, Gabbiadini scored again, his latest goal created by a smart pass from the increasingly influential Tadic. All that remained was for Puel’s latest piece of transfer-market inspiration to thoroughly wrong-foot Koné and John O’Shea by swivelling sharply and shooting low past Vito Mannone.\n\nBy now a study in misery, Moyes reverted to a back four, but not much changed. Instead Jason Denayer was arguably fortunate not to concede a penalty after sending Tadic – who would later force a fine save from Mannone – crashing in the area.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest It was another long afternoon at the Stadium of Light for Sunderland manager David Moyes. Photograph: Lee Smith/Reuters\n\nIt spoke volumes that Fraser Forster was not required to make a serious save until the 67th minute when he kept Ndong’s awkwardly bouncing 25-yard shot out. Almost immediately, Mannone did well to tip a header from Shane Long, on for Gabbiadini, over his bar after the disappointing Koné’s focus slipped once more.\n\nWhen, in the 88th minute, Ryan Bertrand escaped from Wahbi Khazri and crossed low, Long looked set to score but, instead, the ball was turned into his own net by Denayer. Refusing to be thwarted, Long compensated by side-footing James Ward-Prowse’s 90th minute pass home.

Liverpool certainly got the unlikely project off to an auspicious start with a comprehensive victory over Tottenham, keeping up their unbeaten record against other top-six Premier League teams in the process and winning their first league game of 2017 in some style.\n\nKlopp said he wanted his players to produce a performance to make Anfield smile, and they did just that, though it always helps when Liverpool can name all four of their leading attackers – Philippe Coutinho, Roberto Firmino, Adam Lallana and Sadio Mané – in the same team. It does not always work, the quartet appeared in the unexpected defeat at Hull last week, but here Liverpool’s energetic running was causing Spurs problems from the off and Mané in particular looked unplayable at times. The Senegal international had the chance to join Spurs in the summer but the club felt his wage demands were too high. Perhaps it was no accident that he chose this game to show his true worth.\n\nJürgen Klopp congratulates Liverpool players on Tottenham victory Read more\n\nLiverpool started like a team determined to make an early impression, and might have scored before Mané gave them the lead had not Coutinho’s goalbound shot struck the trailing heel of Toby Alderweireld. Tottenham were holding a high defensive line and giving the home side space to run into, which is exactly what happened when a visiting attack broke down and Georginio Wijnaldum was able to slip Mané into an almost empty Spurs half a couple of minutes later. After holding off what remained of the Spurs defence Mané only had Hugo Lloris to beat, which he did deftly enough despite appearing to lose his footing in the act of shooting.\n\nLiverpool v Tottenham Hotspur: Premier League – live! Read more\n\nIf that was an ideal start for a side short on confidence, it got better with a second goal within a matter of just over a minute. This time a ponderous Eric Dier was caught in possession by Mané, who probably imagined either Firmino or Lallana would put the ball in the net, only for both Liverpool players to be denied by excellent saves from Lloris. The danger was not cleared, however, and when the ball came back in his direction Mané scored at the third attempt.\n\nPlaying centre-half in Jan Vertonghen’s absence, Dier did make some amends by getting across to stop Mané’s run into the penalty area after half an hour, though by that stage the Liverpool player could already have completed a hat-trick. He hit the side-netting from a decent opportunity midway through the first half, then followed up on Liverpool’s next attack to bring another diving save from Lloris.\n\nLiverpool also had centre-half problems, Lucas Leiva standing in because Dejan Lovren was injured and Ragnar Klavan sick, though in the first half Tottenham were unable to put the home back line under any sustained pressure. It was Liverpool finding all the space and creating all the chances, and Coutinho really should have put them further ahead when he took his time with a clear shooting opportunity and still ended up putting the ball too close to Lloris.\n\nIt was not quite one-way traffic: Son Heung-min brought a save from Simon Mignolet before the interval and Christian Eriksen was too high with a free-kick from the edge of the area. However, Harry Kane and Dele Alli were not featuring in as many Spurs attacks as Mauricio Pochettino would have liked and neither were the full backs providing the usual width and penetration.\n\nLiverpool ended the first half as they had started it, swarming all around the Spurs box, and they should probably have had greater reward for their movement and invention than a couple of corners that came to nothing.\n\nAt times the home side were passing for fun inside the area, and though their enterprise was a pleasure to watch, Klopp would almost certainly have preferred a little more directness and a third goal to reflect their overall superiority.\n\nThe closest Spurs came to mounting a comeback in the second half was when Kane hit a post from an offside position. Their frustration began to show after an hour, with Alli and Kane both fouling Nathaniel Clyne in quick succession, the latter receiving a caution for an unnecessary stamp.\n\nWhen Emre Can was sent on for the last few minutes, Dier welcomed him with an uncompromising challenge that also brought a booking. Alderweireld became the fifth Spurs player booked when he brought down Firmino as he raced into the area, with the visitors in danger of losing their composure in the closing stages.\n\nLiverpool were unable to add another goal but they remain on top of the imaginary mini-league comprising the top-six teams. Despite ending Chelsea’s unbeaten run, it is Spurs, lucky to claim a point at the Etihad last month, who now appear to be struggling to impose themselves on top-six rivals."}, {"date": "05/02/2017", "arena": "Etihad Stadium", "attendance": 54065, "home_team": {"name": "Manchester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Willy Caballero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fernandinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Stones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aleksandar Kolarov", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gael Clichy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin De Bruyne", "yellows": [42], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [78]}, {"name": "Yaya Touré", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Silva", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Raheem Sterling", "yellows": [44], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [83]}, {"name": "Gabriel Fernando de Jesus", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [11, 90], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leroy Sané", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Claudio Bravo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Vincent Kompany", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pablo Zabaleta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [78], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fernando", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sergio Agüero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [83], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jesus Navas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fabian Delph", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Swansea City", "lineup": [{"name": "Lukasz Fabianski", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Naughton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Federico Fernandez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alfie Mawson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Olsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leroy Fer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Cork", "yellows": [75], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Carroll", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [75]}, {"name": "Wayne Routledge", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [65]}, {"name": "Fernando Llorente", "yellows": [60], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [83]}, {"name": "Gylfi Sigurdsson", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [81], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Jordi Amat", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leon Britton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Borja González", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [83], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathan Dyer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [75], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kristoffer Nordfeldt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Luciano Narsingh", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [65], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stephen Kingsley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "This came close to being the same old unwanted story for Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City. Until Gabriel Jesus’s 92nd-minute winner, it seemed an inability yet again to finish off sides, plus problematic defending, would prove costly.\n\nFirst half brilliant; second half not. This was the pattern for City in a match they should have secured before the break. Instead, as with the 1-1 draws with Everton, Southampton and Middlesbrough in consecutive Premier League home outings in the autumn, Guardiola came close to ruing another victory eluding him.\n\nManchester City v Swansea City: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nWhen Gylfi Sigurdsson collected the ball in midfield and ran forward on 81 minutes there was an inevitability about the equaliser that followed. Now came a late rush for a winner and City’s spirit should be applauded.\n\nYet, as Guardiola said: “We were close not to winning the game at 1-1. I think in 90 minutes we deserved to win in terms of chances and conceding few and the way we play. The gap between the first and second half was too big. I remember what happened against Middlesbrough; it was similar. Today we were lucky to score in the last minute.”\n\nLeroy Sané had given Swansea City the first scare, motoring along the left and pinging the ball on to Jesus, who scooped over. This presaged a period of incessant City pressure. Alfie Mawson tangled with Jesus in the area and Mike Dean waved away the penalty appeal, which appeared to be the correct decision from the referee. David Silva swung in a corner from the left and Swansea scrambled the ball away.\n\nThen came the opener. Fernandinho, a midfielder by trade, was positioned at right-back and the left-field thinking was about to draw the best dividend by igniting the attack that led to the opener. The Brazilian put in a cross that a panicked visiting defence just about hooked away. From the ensuing play, Silva wriggled into the area and aimed the ball at Raheem Sterling. He could not finish but Jesus did, with a volley for a second goal in two games.\n\nThis, again, justified Guardiola’s thinking. After stating Jesus and Sergio Agüero could operate together, the head coach decided Swansea were not the opposition for this as the Argentinian was again on the bench.\n\nThis meant the XI chosen showed two changes from the midweek 4-0 win at West Ham United. In came Fernandinho and Gaël Clichy and out went Bacary Sagna and Nicolás Otamendi. Willy Caballero also retained his place, along with Jesus, as Guardiola decided Claudio Bravo needed more time out.\n\nIn City’s rocket-fuelled start blue shirts came at Swansea with frightening intent and all Paul Clement’s team could do was hang in there.\n\nIn the technical area Guardiola was a swirl of emotion. Pleasure mixed with frustration as he watched Sterling skim the ball in to the danger area but yield only a corner. Silva’s delivery found Yaya Touré but his first-time shot was wide.\n\nLeicester are showing all the symptoms of Cityitis | Daniel Taylor Read more\n\nThis was attack-attack-attack with no end product. A dazzling short corner that involved Kevin De Bruyne interchanging passes with Silva closed with the Belgian failing to score. As the half moved towards the interval City faded and Swansea spent time in their territory. This was the concern for Guardiola: that Clement’s men could mount a smash-and-grab.\n\nGuardiola ended the period chatting to Lee Mason, the fourth official, after Sterling was booked for diving over Lukasz Fabianski’s leg as his manager appeared to believe a penalty might have been given.\n\nWhat Guardiola surely told all his players at the break was that they be more cut-throat. Yet at the start of the second half Swansea pinned them back. Caballero made a show-stopping save to his right to repel Sigurdsson. From the corner City were shaky andthere was relief when the ball came to Jack Cork and he blasted over.\n\nCity’s response was to shift up-field and they nearly benefited from a slice of luck when Sané’s cross became a shot that hit a post but there was no second goal.\n\nThis proved a rare foray forward, though. If Swansea were not as relentless as City’s first-half effort they were close. As the hour mark passed Guardiola wore the look of a man who has seen this all before. Swansea harried, then hurtled towards Caballero’s goal. When Sigurdsson drove in a corner from the right Mawson rose unchallenged and should have beat the keeper but his header was wide.\n\nA lull ensued that was broken when City went close via Sterling and Aleksandar Kolarov. The sense they were just not finishing Swansea off strengthened after Silva dawdled and allowed time for a block on his shot and Guardiola wheeled away in fury.\n\nThe emotion deepened with Sigurdsson’s intervention. Now, Guardiola threw on Agüero but the last-ditch heroics came from Jesus."}, {"date": "05/02/2017", "arena": "The King Power Stadium", "attendance": 32072, "home_team": {"name": "Leicester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Kasper Schmeichel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Simpson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wes Morgan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robert Huth", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Fuchs", "yellows": [40], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Drinkwater", "yellows": [5], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Onyinye Wilfred Ndidi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Riyad Mahrez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shinji Okazaki", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Ahmed Musa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Jamie Vardy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Benjamin Chilwell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andy King", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marc Albrighton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bartosz Kapustka", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ron-Robert Zieler", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Demarai Gray", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yohan Benalouane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Manchester United", "lineup": [{"name": "David De Gea", "yellows": [88], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Antonio Valencia", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eric Bailly", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Smalling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marcos Rojo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Juan Mata", "yellows": [28], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [49], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [77]}, {"name": "Ander Herrera", "yellows": [55], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paul Pogba", "yellows": [56], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Henrikh Mkhitaryan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [42], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marcus Rashford", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [83]}, {"name": "Zlatan Ibrahimovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [44], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Anthony Martial", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jesse Lingard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Carrick", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daley Blind", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Young", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [83], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sergio Romero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marouane Fellaini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [77], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "This video has been removed. This could be because it launched early, our rights have expired, there was a legal issue, or for another reason.\n\nJosé Mourinho has repeatedly bemoaned Manchester United’s lack of ruthlessness in front of goal during his debut season at Old Trafford. To him, it has been the single biggest reason why his team have remained outside the Premier League’s top four. It was a different story here.\n\nThe game had been tight and combative until the end of the first half, with Leicester City having given as good as they got. Step forward Henrikh Mkhitaryan. The United attacking midfielder did not do much but what he did do was of the highest class.\n\nLeicester City 0-3 Manchester United: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nHis breakaway finish put his team on the way to victory – it was a devastating fusion of pace and composure – while he laid on the third goal for Juan Mata early in the second half. When Mkhitaryan makes the difference like this it raises all sorts of questions as to why he struggled to make the team at the start of the season.\n\nUnited went from 0-60mph at an impressive lick whereas Leicester stalled horribly. It was a tough watch for the home crowd after Zlatan Ibrahimovic had added to Mkhitaryan’s goal with his 20th of the season in all competitions and once Mata had made it three it became a procession.\n\nUnited got out a few of their party tricks and it was a nice way for them to end a sticky run of three consecutive draws in the league. United had needed to win to capitalise on the losses of Arsenal and Liverpool from Saturday and they got the job done. As an aside, they still have to travel to Manchester City, Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur.\n\nLeicester’s implosion was total and these are the moments when it appears entirely possible they could become the first club since Manchester City in 1938 to be relegated the season after winning the top-flight title. It is now four straight losses for them in the league and they have not scored in the competition in 2017. Their trip to Swansea City next Sunday has taken on seismic importance.\n\nMkhitaryan had flickered during what was a scrappy first half, combining with Mata midway through it to tee up Marcus Rashford, who had started up front alongside Ibrahimovic. Rashford’s shot flew high. Mkhitaryan looked like the best bet to unlock the stalemate with his lovely touch and direct style, and so it proved.\n\nHe was too quick for Robert Huth, who had stepped up to try to repel a bouncing ball, and in a heartbeat Mkhitaryan had tapped past him and sprinted through on Kasper Schmeichel’s goal. The right-foot finish had too much on it for the goalkeeper.\n\nLeicester looked a little sorry for themselves and, with their concentration down, United twisted the knife. Antonio Valencia was given too much time by Christian Fuchs to cross low from the right, and although Wes Morgan, Huth and Danny Drinkwater were close to Ibrahimovic, they were not close enough. The United striker spun and thumped the ball low past Schmeichel.\n\nLeicester’s situation had been cast into a grimmer light by the victories for Hull City and Sunderland at the bottom of the table on Saturday. They had begun the day only one point above the relegation zone and they had shown fight at the outset, with Jamie Vardy leaving something on Eric Bailly, who was back in the United team for his first football since the Africa Cup of Nations.\n\nBailly had got to the ball first and, after the contact, he tangled with Vardy on the ground and then squared up to him once they had got to their feet. Briefly the temperature was raised; Morgan saw a header blocked by Paul Pogba and Ahmed Musa was halted by Bailly after he wanted too much time inside the area.\n\nMata, unusually, was at the centre of the niggle. He jumped into a reckless tackle on Vardy in the 27th minute and there could be a discussion about whether he deserved a red card rather than the yellow he received.\n\nThe referee, Anthony Taylor, got the decision right. Mata’s studs were showing but his tackling foot was not too far off the ground. Drinkwater and Fuchs were booked for first-half challenges on Mata.\n\nMourinho had switched to a 4-2-3-1 formation midway through the first half, with Mkhitaryan moving in behind Ibrahimovic and Rashford going to the left, and the teenager promptly worked Schmeichel with a low shot. At that point there was little to suggest United were primed to cut loose but this was a demonstration of the sort of efficiency that Mourinho had craved.\n\nThe third goal represented another dismal concession from Leicester’s point of view. Fuchs did not track Mata from Mkhitaryan’s killer pass and, with Morgan playing him onside in the middle, Mata shot coolly past Schmeichel.\n\nLeicester had nothing in response and United had the chances to put a more emphatic slant on the scoreline, with Rashford testing Schmeichel and Mata blowing a one-on-one with a fluffed attempted lob. There were boos from the home support at the end.

greatest compliment that can be paid to this renascent Chelsea side, now the title race is starting to feel like a procession and we might be witnessing one of the great managerial performances of the modern era, is that there is still three months to go and it is difficult to see even a flicker of hope for the teams in their wing-mirrors.\n\nWhat other conclusion can be drawn after the latest triumph from the Premier League’s runaway leaders and another day when it was laid out in precise terms why Antonio Conte’s men are pulling clear, with the chasing pack little more than a speck in the distance? Chelsea have won all but one of their home matches this season. A team who finished 10th last season have reinvented themselves as champions-in-waiting, averaging close to two and a half points a game, and in the process they have also managed to bring forward what is now firmly established as the annual Arsenal meltdown. First versus third, at the start of play, was nothing like as close as might have been anticipated.\n\nInstead, it became another demonstration of why Arsène Wenger was horribly mistaken to believe his watery, lightweight team might be authentic title challengers and, with four defeats in their past nine league fixtures, the most pertinent question for Arsenal now is not whether they can make up the 12-point gap to Chelsea but if they have the fortitude to continue their long sequence of top-four finishes.\n\nArsenal fans endure another groundhog day as they flatline at Chelsea | Jacob Steinberg Read more\n\nThat cannot be guaranteed on the evidence provided by an afternoon memorable for Conte indulging in some impromptu crowd-surfing after Eden Hazard had waltzed through the visitors’ defence to make it 2-0 with a piece of individual brilliance. Hazard chose a good day to put in his best performance of the season and it was a wonderfully taken goal from the player whose decline epitomised the team’s shortcomings last season.\n\nAt this stage a year ago, Chelsea had 29 points and were languishing in 13th position, closer to the relegation zone than the top five. Their latest win puts them on 59 points and there is nothing whatsoever to suggest they might be susceptible to the kind of loss of nerve that might endanger other sides in this position. Arsenal, for one.\n\nWenger’s team have now lost in their past five visits to Stamford Bridge, with a combined score of 15-2, and perhaps the most alarming aspect for a team who last won the league 13 years ago is that it is the same deficiencies on each occasion. Every time, we come away with questions about Arsenal’s strength of personality. Once again, we saw a key game unfold without any meaningful contribution from Mesut Özil and came away wondering whether they were too fragile, mentally and physically, to sustain a title challenge – and what that said about a manager who has lost the art of assembling durable championship contenders.\n\nAlexis Sánchez has rarely been so peripheral and the game became a personal ordeal for Petr Cech, returning to the ground where he experienced so many career highs, five minutes from the end of normal time when the goalkeeper misdirected a kick to gave the ball straight to a player in blue. That player happened to be Cesc Fàbregas, once of Arsenal, and someone of his refinement was unlikely to pass up this kind of gift, lifting the ball into an exposed goal.\n\nThe lesson for Arsenal is an old one: that no team can defend this generously and expect to get away with it. Hazard’s goal was a beauty but a more resilient side would never have allowed him to run so far. Hazard eluded four Arsenal players before aiming his shot past Cech and it probably typified the match that his 40-yard slalom began with one of the smallest players on the pitch outmuscling Francis Coquelin, supposedly Arsenal’s midfield protector.\n\nThis, however, was the theme of an afternoon in which Olivier Giroud’s stoppage-time header had little bearing other than to raise questions about whether the Frenchman should have been involved from the start rather than being used as a late substitute.\n\nWenger complained afterwards that Chelsea’s opening goal should not have stood because Marcos Alonso had flattened Héctor Bellerín in the process with a flying elbow and it was certainly an almighty whack that the Arsenal defender took to the side of the head.\n\nYet Wenger should also reflect on the fact it was Bellerín who challenged Diego Costa moments earlier when the Chelsea striker had the initial attempt at goal, and the same defender who was involved again after the ball struck the crossbar, looped up and dropped into the six-yard area. In those moments, not one of Bellerín’s team-mates helped out. Indeed, closer analysis of the goal showed Theo Walcott, the nearest player to Alonso, drifting half-heartedly back rather than showing any real desire to involve himself. Walcott’s lackadaisical efforts, coupled with Coquelin’s inability to sense danger, wer brutally exposed by Alonso’s determination to get to the ball first.\n\nChelsea 3-1 Arsenal: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nChelsea had the mix of Costa’s power, Hazard’s nimble running and a midfielder, N’Golo Kanté, who did not give his opponents a minute’s peace. They looked stronger physically and, all the time, Conte stalked the touchline, throwing out his arms, screaming to the skies and doing a fine impression of someone whose shoes were on fire. To see the Italian is to understand why Chelsea’s players dare not lower their standards.\n\nGabriel, who replaced Bellerín, had a chance to equalise with a first-half header but Wenger acknowledged afterwards there was never any part of the match when the away side put their opponents under prolonged pressure. Chelsea, he said, looked like champions, playing with “full confidence – they’re powerful, strong and they don’t concede goals”.

What’s more, at the 38th time of asking they finally won a Premier League match which their midfielder Jack Rodwell started. Substituted in the second half with a hamstring injury, the midfielder will have enjoyed getting this giant chest-beating gorilla off his back.\n\nSam Allardyce, by contrast, was left visibly appalled and apoplectic by a first half in which Palace charitably allowed Sunderland to score more goals than they had managed in their previous nine games on the road combined. “It’s apparent to me that the players are struggling with fear here at home and I’ve got to get rid of that fear and get them playing much better than they are now,” he said.\n\n“It’s nothing to do with the fans, who don’t put them under as much pressure as the fans at other clubs. And I apologise to those fans for this performance.”\n\nThey will feel entitled to their apology. As they booed their team off at half-time, one of their number was hauled away after invading the pitch to confront the defender Damien Delaney at the end of a 45-minute spell in which Palace shipped collector’s items from Lamine Koné and Didier Ndong, as well as two more from Sunderland’s go-to goal-getter Jermain Defoe.\n\n“I haven’t been in that position too many times as a manager or player,” David Moyes said of his side’s interval lead. “If you’re a manager and you’re getting beat all the time, it doesn’t matter who you are, it affects you.”\n\nDespite Palace having spent the thick end of £40m in January, there were few new faces in their starting lineup. Allardyce named an unchanged side from that who had secured his only Premier League win with the club against Bournemouth. Patrick van Aanholt endured a home baptism of fire against his former club, but Mamadou Sakho, Jeffrey Schlupp and Luka Milivojevic avoided being tainted by any association with this performance.\n\nHaving plundered his former club Everton for new recruits to help in his bid to keep Sunderland in the Premier League, Moyes drafted in Bryan Oviedo for a mightily impressive debut, while his fellow former Toffee Darron Gibson and Joleon Lescott also made bows from the bench.\n\nA most implausible rout began from a free-kick inside 10 minutes. Seb Larsson wafted the ball towards the far post, where Koné leaped highest to head goalwards. Under pressure from Billy Jones, the Palace goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey was unable to catch the ball which broke kindly to provide Koné with a second bite of the cherry. Still seated on his backside following his aeriel endeavours seconds previously, the burly French defender poked home from four yards.\n\nJust before the 20th minute, Larsson – already on a booking – was penalised for clambering all over Wilfried Zaha and from the ensuing free-kick the ball found its way to James Tomkins. The defender forced the home crowd out of their seats as he got on the end of a Damien Delaney cross, only to plant a firm header just the wrong side of Vito Mannone’s right upright.\n\nWith thoughts turning to the break, Sunderland again forced open the Palace portcullis. Didier Ndong doubled their lead with a long-range effort after a mistake by Delaney, drilling past Hennessey with a sweet left-footed drive from 25 yards. Soon after, in possession on the left flank with half-time approaching, Januzaj rolled a weighted ball to Defoe, who curled his low drive across Hennessey’s bows and into the bottom corner. Seconds later, the incredulous pair combined again, with Defoe turning Tomkins to fire home on the turn and make it 4-0. The travelling support were left as agog as their home counterparts were enraged.\n\nSent out for the second half five minutes early, Palace’s visibly embarrassed players dominated the second half but could not score. A Tomkins free-kick from distance sailed high over the cross-bar to prompt a fan exodus, before Zaha, the substitute Loïc Rémy and Chrsitian Benteke missed presentable chances. With full-time approaching, Jason Denayer performed acrobatic heroics to clear a Jason Puncheon shot that looked goal-bound. Proof, if proof was needed, that this just was not Crystal Palace’s day.\n\nJames Morrison strikes early to give West Bromwich Albion win over Stoke Read more"}, {"date": "04/02/2017", "arena":

Yet the Everton manager was nowhere near as pleased with what he saw in the second half, for after establishing complete control and a three-goal lead the home side all but surrendered their advantage in losing their momentum after the interval.\n\nGabriel Jesus at the double as Manchester City leave it late to beat Swansea Read more\n\nBournemouth went behind after 30 seconds, before most members of their team had managed to touch the ball, and for the rest of the first half they looked demoralised and resigned to a beating. If Eddie Howe made any plans to deal with Lukaku’s threat they were in tatters in under a minute. The Everton striker merely breathed on the Bournemouth defence on the home side’s opening foray and an obliging gap appeared. Cutting in from the right, Lukaku strode into it and beat Artur Boruc with a confident shot into the top corner.\n\nThat did nothing to harm Everton’s self-belief and swagger and Ademola Lookman almost made it two moments later, bamboozling Harry Arter on the edge of the area but sliding a shot narrowly wide. They went further ahead midway through the first half when Lukaku again made a nuisance of himself, this time by reaching the dead-ball line past some fairly shoddy defending by Tyrone Mings and Mark Pugh to turn a pass back for James McCarthy to score.\n\nLeicester are showing all the symptoms of Cityitis | Daniel Taylor Read more\n\nIf Bournemouth imagined things could not get any worse they were wrong. Under no particular pressure Simon Francis hit a risky backpass for Lukaku to intercept and score with nonchalant ease. They were lucky to turn around only three down. Seamus Coleman saw a shot saved just before the break and had Lukaku found Lookman to his left, instead of Ashley Williams to his right, when Everton went charging upfield against an undermanned defence, the young forward might have made a better job of finishing. “The first half wasn’t pretty,” Howe said. “We didn’t handle the goals very well at all.”\n\nBoth sides looked flat at the start of the second half, though at least Bournemouth showed spirit in hitting back with what looked like a consolation goal. Everton gave Jack Wilshere too much space to weigh up his options and the result was a lofted pass that split the two home centre-halves and allowed Josh King to run through. While that did not seem too much of a worry, alarm bells began ringing when Pugh almost sent in King again two minutes later.\n\nUnable to break out of their own half, Everton conceded another when Ryan Fraser crossed for King to collect his second. For just a few minutes, during which Joel Robles had to beat out a goalbound effort from Arter, it looked as though one of the fightbacks of the season might be on. But Everton still had Lukaku, and when they reshuffled their backline and finally worked out how to get up the pitch again it was a relatively simple matter for the striker to play a return with Coleman and meet his cross for a hat-trick.\n\nWith only seven minutes remaining that ought to have been that, yet an unpredictable script still had more twists. Lukaku scored a fourth, courtesy of Ross Barkley’s clever backheel, before Arter deservedly got onto the scoresheet at the other end, collecting a rebound off an upright before tapping the ball in. The final goal went to Barkley, who rounded Boruc and raised his arms in celebration before stroking the ball into an empty Park End net.\n\n“It was a strange result after the half-time score. Our intensity dropped,” Koeman said. “It was a great game for the fans, but not for me.”"}, {"date": "04/02/2017", "arena": "KCOM Stadium", "attendance": 24822, "home_team": {"name": "Hull City", "lineup": [{"name": "Eldin Jakupovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Omar Elabdellaoui", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andrea Ranocchia", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Maguire", "yellows": [27], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andrew Robertson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Huddlestone", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alfred N'Diaye", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [44], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kamil Grosicki", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [80]}, {"name": "Evandro", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [62]}, {"name": "Samuel Clucas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Abel Hernandez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [65]}], "subs": [{"name": "David Meyler", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [80], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shaun Maloney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dieumerci Mbokani", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adama Diomande", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Marshall", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Oumar Niasse", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [84], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [65], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Josh Tymon", "yellows": [74], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [62], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Liverpool", "lineup": [{"name": "Simon Mignolet", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathaniel Clyne", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joel Matip", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lucas Leiva", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Milner", "yellows": [40], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [83]}, {"name": "Adam Lallana", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [83]}, {"name": "Jordan Henderson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Emre Can", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [67]}, {"name": "Sadio Mané", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Roberto Firmino", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Philippe Coutinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Loris Karius", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Georginio Wijnaldum", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Gomez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daniel Sturridge", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [67], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alberto Moreno", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [83], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Divock Origi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [83], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Trent Alexander-Arnold", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Jürgen Klopp suspected the worst was over after Liverpool’s midweek display against a Chelsea team cruising towards the title. He was wrong. Great first half, dreadful second: Liverpool are threatening to take the template for their entire Premier League campaign from last season’s Europa League final.\n\nIt is one win in 10 matches for Klopp’s team after Hull City, revitalised by astute management and January recruits, deepened the worry lines on the Liverpool manager and, in the process, improved what were once slim chances of avoiding relegation. Marco Silva has taken seven points from his four Premier League games and new signings Alfred N’Diaye, Andrea Ranocchia, Kamil Grosicki and Oumar Niasse all influenced a fourth consecutive home victory at the KCom Stadium. Midfielder N’Diaye opened the scoring as Liverpool faulted at a set-piece. The visitors’ other recurring flaw, defending against a counterattack, also featured, as Niasse broke clear to wrap up victory late on. It was the first time the Senegal striker has made Evertonians happy since his £13.5m move to Goodison Park 13 months ago.\n\n“When I first arrived the atmosphere was not the best,” said Silva. “The squad was in the last position in the table and many people did not believe. The first match I don’t see our supporters in our stadium. Today, I saw them everywhere, and a fantastic atmosphere. If I believe, I want my players, my supporters, to believe as well. If I believed on the first day then why I don’t believe now? But the truth is we only won three points today, nothing more.”\n\nBut this was not merely three points dropped by Liverpool. Klopp was deflated instead of angry after the final whistle, searching for answers to a performance that will trouble him more than any other since the turn of the year. One of the few he could muster was that Liverpool’s spirits have nose-dived, along with their form, due to Chelsea disappearing over the horizon in the title race. “This week we had a really good performance but we didn’t build on it,” said Klopp. “We have to take all the criticism we receive from everywhere.”\n\nThe Liverpool manager was particularly aggrieved at a slow, careless start from players who had delivered the polar opposite against Antonio Conte’s team at Anfield. Hull’s breakthrough was a fitting tribute to a scrappy first half and another entry into the Liverpool catalogue of weak defending at set-pieces. Two careless touches from Emre Can gifted Hull a corner. Poland international Grosicki crossed from the right, Harry Maguire headed into the six-yard area and Simon Mignolet, under pressure from Abel Hernández, could only palm the ball down at the feet of N’Diaye, who made no mistake from close range.\n\nQuestions will be rightly asked of an unconvincing intervention from the Liverpool goalkeeper, but Mignolet was not the only player culpable. Hernández and N’Diaye reacted quicker than anyone in red when Maguire won the initial header, and were unmarked as Mignolet attempted to claim possession while Jordan Henderson, Lucas Leiva and Nathaniel Clyne were caught static.\n\nRomelu Lukaku hits four as Everton see off brave Bournemouth fightback Read more\n\nBoth the Liverpool and Hull defences had been reorganised late in the day, but neither was seriously examined until N’Diaye’s first goal for his new club. Lucas was drafted in at centre-back by Klopp, with Dejan Lovren absent because of a knee problem, while Silva lost his captain, Michael Dawson, to a calf injury during the warm-up. Italian Ranocchia was summonsed from the bench to make his first start since arriving on loan from Internazionale and was one of three full debutants in the Hull team, alongside Grosicki and the goalscorer. All three made assured starts, although it was the Premier League experience of Tom Huddlestone that shone in the centre of Hull’s performance. His quick-thinking and quicker feet helped Hull turn defence into counterattack throughout the first half, but this was not another of those contests that have seen Liverpool toil against deep-lying opposition of late. The visitors were subdued and aimless until finally upping the tempo and threat levels after the restart.\n\nAndy Carroll inspires West Ham’s fightback to shock Southampton Read more\n\nThe second half initially reflected a game between a team with designs on the Champions League and another hoping to avoid the Championship. Klopp’s team restarted brightly, stretching Hull repeatedly and forcing a desperate rearguard action. Yet again, however, an end product was absent.\n\nSadio Mané forced a fine save from the backpeddling Jakupovic when he rose above Andy Robertson to head Adam Lallana’s cross goalwards. The keeper also made a routine save from Can’s diving header before Coutinho missed Liverpool’s clearest opportunity when James Milner’s effort deflected into his path off Maguire. The Brazil international had time and space at the back post, but sliced his shot so badly that it sailed across goal and out.\n\nAlmost inevitably, Klopp’s team were punished on the counterattack. Hull’s second goal stemmed from Mané losing possession under a challenge from Maguire. Referee Lee Mason ignored his appeals for a free-kick and Ranocchia played a first-time clearance over the Liverpool defence for Niasse to chase. The Senegal international sprinted through to beat Mignolet with a cool, low finish and Silva’s rescue mission gathered fresh momentum."}, {"date": "04/02/2017", "arena": " Mary's Stadium",

Premier League and in condemning Southampton to their sixth defeat in seven matches, Slaven Bilic taught Claude Puel a severe lesson.\n\nThe Saints have their moments and those moments can be bewitching. Manolo Gabbiadini’s debut goal was one such, the £14m striker smashing home off the bar from an acute angle to give his side a 12th-minute lead. But in certain vital qualities – strength, aggression, determination – they are lacking and after a day of topsy-turvy results Puel is looking over his shoulder at the relegation zone.\n\nFor Bilic, meanwhile, it must feel like the storm has cleared. The Croat has seemed a bereft figure at points this season as he has dealt not only with poor form but a new, unpopular home and a series of injuries. But the ostracisation and subsequent departure of Dimitri Payet appears to have been a cathartic moment. The Hammers have now won three of their past four matches and are back in the top half of the table.\n\n“We deserved this big time,” Bilic said after the match. “We closed down, we made tackles, we defended deep when we needed to and then, once we had a goal, we were everything you could ask for. You have a plan but the boys were responsible; they executed that brilliantly.”\n\nThe Hammers drew level two minutes after falling behind and Pedro Obiang was the architect. After he was allowed to advance all the way from his own half to within 25 yards of goal, not only did Southampton back off but they failed to close the gaps in midfield and defence. Obiang was able to pick a pass through both lines and find Andy Carroll, who had spun Jack Stephens as if he was not there. Carroll, who left the field in the second half with a tweaked groin that Bilic believes should not keep him out of their next match, calmly took a touch and finished low under Fraser Forster.\n\nThe scoreline was even, then, but there was a definite sense that West Ham had the hosts’ measure. Playing physically wherever possible and looking to hit crosses at the young Stephens and uncertain Maya Yoshida, their game plan was clear but Saints were hard pressed to counter it. What is more, with Robert Snodgrass on set-pieces, it was fair to say that the Hammers had quality in delivery to match the departed Payet.\n\n“With Snodgrass, we knew about his left foot, we knew about his vision and the plans he forms in his head,” Bilic said. “But his work rate was amazing.”\n\nIt was a Snodgrass corner that led to West Ham’s second goal on the verge of half-time. The ball was swung in to the penalty spot where Gabbiadini met it and flicked it well clear of the area. It fell again to Obiang, however, and he drove the ball straight back at goal. It bobbled and took a small deflection but still should have been saved by Forster, who was unable to stop it. Bilic said it was the crucial moment in the match.\n\nPuel made changes at half-time but introduced Shane Long – who had three goals in his four previous matches – only when Sofiane Boufal went off injured. The Saints created chances, but by that point they were 3-1 down after a Mark Noble free-kick was deflected into the net by Steven Davis.\n\n“We started very well with a fantastic goal and it’s not the first time we’ve conceded within five minutes,” Puel said, whose side travel next to David Moyes’s Sunderland. “We need concentration and we lacked energy in the first half. The second half was quality with many chances, but it’s not good enough only to win the second half.\n\n“We play against teams now that it’s important to take points from. We can see the top half of the table but we can also see other possibilities. It’s an important game against Sunderland.”\n\nRomelu Lukaku hits four as Everton see off brave Bournemouth fightback Read more"}, {"date": "04/02/2017", "arena": "Vicarage Road", "attendance": 20178,

Ashley Barnes pulled one back from the penalty spot for Burnley after the Watford defender Sebastian Prödl handled the ball but the home side held on to claim successive Premier League wins for the first time since September.\n\nBarnes scuffed a chance to claim an equaliser in stoppage time and, despite two wins in the space of four days, Mazzarri wants his side to hone their killer instinct.\n\n“I’m very happy of course because we won. I liked the way we played in the first half but I’m not happy at all about the second,” he said. “This is why I say we have to grow in mentality as a team because the big teams would have closed this game like we should.\n\n“We could have scored three or four goals but we didn’t do it and we risked losing three points for immature mistakes that could have changed the game The only excuse I can find is that we played a very important game a few days ago against Arsenal where we spent a lot in terms of condition. Also we have many players coming back from injury who are still finding the perfect condition but we should have scored the third goal.\n\n“Before this game I told my players that the transfer market is finished and you are the team that is going to be until the end of the season and you always have to go with the same spirit as we had at Arsenal.”\n\nThe defeat continued Burnley’s poor Premier League away form and Sean Dyche’s side have only taken one point on the road. Dyche took delight in his team’s performance despite their numerical disadvantage and had little issue with the dismissal of Hendrick – the midfielder was given a red card after six minutes for a two-footed challenge on José Holebas – but felt if his side had 11 men on the field then the outcome of the game would have been different.\n\n“I don’t usually over-praise the side but I thought they were fantastic, particularly in the second half,” Dyche said. “The early blow of getting a man sent off but then another blow before half‑time, the mentality to see through that and still respond to the challenge and still take the game on, to try to win it, I thought was absolutely outstanding – 11 versus 11, with the way we performed today, we would have probably won the game.\n\n“It’s a tough one [the red card], I think in the heat of the moment, the referee is under pressure to give it. When I look back on it, there’s minimal physical contact but let’s make it clear, his [Hendrick] foot hits the top of the ball. But what can the referee do nowadays? I think he has to send him off.”\n\nA difficult day for Burnley got worse four minutes after Hendrick’s dismissal. Niang cut in from the right flank and floated a beautiful cross on to the head of Deeney, who outmuscled the defender Matt Lowton at the far post. Burnley were presented with a rare chance to equalise after Valon Behrami brought down George Boyd on the edge of the area but Heurelho Gomes tipped Boyd’s free-kick over the bar.\n\nAt that point, Burnley looked to have survived Watford’s onslaught but their slim chances of claiming a draw sustained a blow on the stroke of half‑time. Niang leapt highest to get the deftest touch on Holebas’s cross and double the lead.\n\nDyche sent on the deadline-day signing Robbie Brady in the 55th minute but the tempo dropped in the second half, with Watford happy to keep possession and maintain their lead.\n\nBarnes had a claim for penalty denied after 67 minutes as Sebastian Prödl looked to have put his arm into the striker’s path. Heaton was on hand to pull off another great save at the other end to deny Deeney, whose outstretched boot connected with Niang’s cross.\n\nRomelu Lukaku hits four as Everton see off brave Bournemouth fightback Read more\n\nHome fans paid tribute to the former manager Graham Taylor in the 72nd minute. Burnley pulled a goal back moments later. Following a scramble in the box Michael Oliver pointed to the spot after Joey Barton’s effort struck the arm of Prödl and Barnes stepped up to halve the deficit. They should have equalised in stoppage time when Craig Cathcart’s slip allowed Barnes a sight of goal in the box but Gomes got down well to block the shot.

Throw in Saido Berahino’s return to the Hawthorns a few weeks after signing for Stoke, and a bubbling enmity between the two benches, and this was a spicier game than the 1-0 scoreline suggested.\n\nIt was revealed during the week that Berahino, greeted with boos before the game and even during his half-time warm-up, had served an eight-week ban for recreational drug use while he was with West Brom. His half-hour on the pitch was ultimately a non‑event – it was 20 minutes before he even touched the ball – but after the game the Stoke manager, Mark Hughes, hinted the ban becoming public knowledge might not have been an accident.\n\n“They were able to keep it under wraps, then lo and behold it comes out two days before this game,” Hughes said. “It’s a shame because people might suggest West Brom had something to do with it. But that would be unfair, wouldn’t it?” When asked if he was accusing West Brom of deliberately trying to unsettle Stoke, Hughes – butter refusing to melt in his mouth – said: “I’m not saying that. You can interpret it like that.”\n\nThis was a game that West Brom largely dominated, and they were disappointed that James Morrison’s sixth‑minute strike was all they had to show for their efforts. That goal came when Nacer Chadli counter-attacked down the left, slid a perfect ball through to Morrison, who was allowed as much time and space as he liked to slot the ball into the bottom corner.\n\nBy the 14th minute Chadli was showboating, and while he is undoubtedly a fine player, Stoke’s backline might have benefited from being told that they were not, in fact, facing Garrincha.\n\nOn the touchline, Tony Pulis was the more animated of the two managers, ostentatiously annoyed that his team had not capitalised on their dominance. “If we’re being critical we’d like to have scored more goals,” Pulis’s assistant Dave Kemp said after the game. This result was West Brom’s sixth win in the last seven at home, and leaves them six points behind Manchester United. Is European football a possibility? “Let’s not get too excited,” Kemp said.\n\nUltimately West Brom made heavier work of the win than they should have, but they held on against a sluggish Stoke side. Not that Hughes was keen to give them too much credit. “When you come here it’s always difficult to break West Brom down, because they’ll get lots of men behind the ball and make it difficult for you,” he said.\n\nAt full-time Pulis disappeared down the tunnel and eschewed the post-match pleasantries, as he apparently had done before the game too. “I’d have thought that being the guest he would have welcomed me, but he didn’t,” Hughes said. “I’m not too upset about it to be honest.”\n\nThe ill will continues, and this rivalry is all the better for it."}, {"date": "04/02/2017", "arena":

Middlesbrough door, a penalty from Harry Kane preserving their outside chance of disturbing Chelsea at the top of the table. There was no doubt Spurs were the dominant team but cussed Boro made that darned tough to prove on the scoreboard.\n\n“It was a good performance, I’m very happy, but we need to keep improving and be more clinical,” Mauricio Pochettino said. The Spurs manager went into the game knowing this match would test the depth of his squad’s human and mental resources. How would the absence of Danny Rose and Jan Vertonghen affect their defence? And how would the increasingly faint sight of Chelsea’s exhaust fumes affect their belief they can overtake the league leaders? Or maybe their imperative was to pull away from the other chasers on a day when Arsenal and Liverpool flopped?\n\nTottenham Hotspur 1-0 Middlesbrough: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nEither way, after Tuesday’s anaemic draw at Sunderland, the Spurs manager needed to see a demonstration of iron conviction here as well as a cutting edge, especially as Middlesbrough, despite their lowly position, are stubborn travellers, with only Chelsea having conceded fewer away league goals than them this season. Mind you, Spurs are exceptionally inhospitable hosts and have now beaten the last 10 visitors to White Hart Lane.\n\nThis, though, was a hard fight. Boro were even the first to threaten, as Adama Traoré hurtled down the right wing and crossed for Álvaro Negredo, who headed over from eight yards. That, however, was about as audacious as Boro got, as Spurs took over and forced Boro to defend. They did so splendidly, abetted by the fact Spurs’ finishing was more scruffy than their smooth buildups.\n\nSon Heung-min’s low shot from the left after fine work by Dele Alli and Kane forced an excellent diving save from Victor Valdés in the fifth minute. Four minutes later Christian Eriksen released Alli with a sumptuous pass, but the midfielder clipped his shot into the side-netting.\n\nSpurs began to enjoy the lion’s share of possession but Boro were no pussycats and defended tigerishly. Even still, they would have fallen behind in the 23rd minute if Toby Alderweireld’s header from a corner by Eriksen had been a couple of inches more to the right; instead it bounced out off the near post.\n\nAnxiety grew among the home crowd in the face of Boro’s disciplined resistance and Spurs’ imprecision when push came to shove. Kane could have eased nerves in the 35th minute when he darted into a rare gap in the visiting defence and received a cross by Son but he headed over from 12 yards. Alderweireld went closer before the break with another header, again from a corner by Eriksen, but Valdés saved. By half-time the home fans could have been forgiven for fretting about another frustrating draw. Or worse.\n\nArsenal’s Arsène Wenger fumes at first goal after defeat by Chelsea Read more\n\nFor all his team’s cussedness, Aitor Karanka was not happy with Boro and sensed some of his players had been unnerved by the victories of Hull and Sunderland earlier in the day. “I told them at half-time we needed to play our way and be more aggressive and intense,” he said. “We showed in the second half that we can compete against every team.”\n\nBut Spurs remained in charge. Pochettino changed neither his personnel nor his team’s approach during the break, seemingly convinced that persistence would pay. There were sceptics in the crowd, however, and they groaned in the 48th minute when Kane spurned a shooting chance and lost possession. There was no such dithering from Eriksen two minutes later but his blast from 20 yards was batted away by Valdés. Boro’s defenders were proving equally defiant: closing, blocking and clearing like their Premier League lives’ depended on it. But then, in the 56th minute, a sleight of foot in the box by Son duped Bernardo Espinosa into a foul. The referee pointed to the spot; the crowd held its breath; and Kane held his nerve to send Valdés the wrong way and the ball into the net.\n\nSpurs did not bask in their relief. They chased another goal. Eriksen would have got one immediately if not for another brilliant stop by Valdés. Then the irrepressible Son struck the outside of the post after being sent clear by Alli.\n\nSpurs had Boro in a headlock and refused to let go – until a punt forward in stoppage time nearly led to an equaliser, only for Marten de Roon to drag a shot wide from 10 yards. Asked whether his team’s title hopes would have been shattered if that shot had found the net, Pochettino said: “Maybe, yes. But nine points [between Spurs and Chelsea] is OK. There are a lot of games ahead. I am happy to put pressure on us and say we are a real contender and we are a team ready to win the title.

He had left a lasting impression by then.\n\nAlready the Brazilian looks the successor in waiting to Agüero, the very notion that he will improve in the years ahead enough to reduce defenders to gibbering wrecks. He operated as the nominal central pivot in what felt like a front five here, sporting gloves and a short-sleeved shirt with the ball almost invariably glued to his instep. He was utterly irrepressible on his first Premier League start.\n\nWest Ham United 0-4 Manchester City: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\n“You never know [how a player will adapt],” said Guardiola. “It’s like a water melon. You have to open it up and see. But we knew the potential was good, he’s talented and so aggressive about wanting to be a good player, and that helps a lot. He has dreams about what he wants to do in his future career. He wants to become something in world football and we’re going to try and get it [to be] for us.”\n\nThere was snarl in his tackling, energy in his tracking back and jaw-dropping skill in his forays forward. The forward schooled at Palmeiras already looks an inspired signing. Agüero, a world-class talent, will believe he still has plenty to offer this team but his cameo at the end seemed an afterthought. It is not quite a changing of the guard yet but there have not been many occasions over his own City career where the Argentinian has played second fiddle.\n\n“Sergio remains such an important player for us,” stressed Guardiola. “We cannot achieve our goals without his contribution. But those three guys – Leroy [Sané], Gabriel and Raheem [Sterling] – are the future for this club. The average age is around 20. You don’t see strikers as young as that at big European clubs at the moment.”\n\nWest Ham looked in awe of that front trio, supplied eagerly by David Silva and Kevin De Bruyne from slightly deeper berths, and disintegrated from the moment they were first pierced. Sané almost matched Jesus at every surge, dispossessing dawdling West Ham players whenever they had the temerity to take a breath in enemy territory and humiliating Byram and José Fonte whenever he could isolate them one on one. He had nutmegged the former and glided away from the Portuguese midway through the first half, Fonte reduced to a trudge as Sané’s centre flicked off Darren Randolph and was tapped in by David Silva at the far post.\n\nManchester United fall short of José Mourinho’s demands in goalless draw Read more\n\nThat reward came four minutes after City had gone ahead, Aaron Cresswell’s aimless pass in-field collected by De Bruyne who sprinted downfield, exchanged passes with Jesus, then side-footed in beyond the static goalkeeper.\n\nThe teenager was never likely to be denied his own reward for long. He had just summoned a gloriously paced pass inside Cresswell for Sterling to collect – De Bruyne air-kicked at the resultant cross – when Pedro Obiang surrendered the ball wastefully to Sané. The rat-a-tat exchange which ensued led to the German and Sterling slicing West Ham apart, with Jesus converting at the far post. Throw in Yaya Touré’s penalty, after Fonte had capped a dismal debut by tripping Sterling, and this was a thrashing every bit as comprehensive as that inflicted in the FA Cup a little under four weeks ago.\n\nNot that Guardiola considered it the prelude to a renewed title challenge. The gap from Chelsea, represented by their manager, Antonio Conte, in the directors’ box here, remains a gaping 10 points. “Only Chelsea can lose the Premier League,” added the City manager, who had dropped Claudio Bravo to the bench.\n\n“Look at how many they’ve lost in the last 16. They’re not going to lose four or five in the games they have left. It’s a mistake to think about them when you are 10 points behind. We’ve been inconsistent and to qualify for the Champions League and fight until the end, you have to make a good run of victories, otherwise it will be impossible. We are not thinking about big goals because the gap is too much.”"}, {"date": "01/02/2017", "arena": "Old Trafford", "attendance": 75297, "home_team": {"name": "Manchester United", "lineup": [{"name": "David De Gea", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Antonio Valencia", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Jones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [55]}, {"name": "Marcos Rojo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daley Blind", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ander Herrera", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Carrick", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Paul Pogba", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Henrikh Mkhitaryan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [62]}, {"name": "Zlatan Ibrahimovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marcus Rashford", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Juan Mata", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [62], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wayne Rooney", "yellows": [84], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Anthony Martial", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Smalling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [55], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jesse Lingard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Young", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sergio Romero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Hull City", "lineup": [{"name": "Eldin Jakupovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Meyler", "yellows": [89], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Dawson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Maguire", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andrew Robertson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Huddlestone", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lazar Markovic", "yellows": [81], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Evandro", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [72]}, {"name": "Samuel Clucas", "yellows": [79], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Josh Tymon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [66]}, {"name": "Oumar Niasse", "yellows": [13], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [69]}], "subs": [{"name": "Abel Hernandez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [69], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andrea Ranocchia", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [66], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Omar Elabdellaoui", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [72], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shaun Maloney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adama Diomande", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Marshall", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jarrod Bowen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Manchester United are in danger of dropping out of the race for Champions League qualification unless they start winning again. A return to the stodgy football that haunted Louis van Gaal’s reign as manager and a lack of ruthlessness is costing José Mourinho’s side rather than the unfair officiating he believes is shaping the season.\n\nTowards the end Juan Mata was found by Chris Smalling in front of Hull City’s goal but the Spaniard missed badly: it was a microcosm of what plagues United. This draw means there has been a solitary league victory in four outings in 2017 and the gap to fourth-placed Liverpool is four points despite Jürgen Klopp’s side dropping two against Chelsea on Tuesday.\n\nJosé Mourinho: I get different treatment than Jürgen Klopp and Arsène Wenger Read more\n\nThe evening started with the non-appearance of Anthony Martial when the rest of the substitutes warmed up. However, the forward did stride out for the kick-off to take his place on the bench.\n\nFor a match that Mourinho said United had to win, the manager made nine changes from the XI that knocked Wigan Athletic out of the FA Cup here on Sunday, with Marcos Rojo and Henrikh Mkhitaryan the only survivors. Marco Silva stood down five of the side that suffered a 4-1 reverse to Fulham in the competition. Eldin Jakupovic, the goalkeeper, Andrew Robertson, David Meyler, Tom Huddlestone, Sam Clucas and Evandro Goebel were all retained by the manager, who would have settled for a draw given Hull’s perilous position at the bottom of the table, five points from safety, before kick-off.\n\nUnited have been slow starters of late so Mourinho would have been pleased to see Ander Herrera zip the ball into Mkhitaryan early on but not how the half unfolded. Only a vital interception from Robertson stopped the Armenian following some neat control.\n\nAfter this United – and the contest – became stuck in the middle third of the pitch. The home side dominated possession but a lack of invention and an inability to utilise the pace of Marcus Rashford and Mkhitaryan allowed Hull to stifle them.\n\nIt was Rashford who broke the game open by troubling Hull along their right. The No19 quickstepped infield, fed Zlatan Ibrahimovic and the Swede’s shot gave the visitors a warning.\n\nManchester United close in on £85m Antoine Griezmann deal, say reports Read more\n\nNext, Antonio Valencia swapped passes with Herrera and split Hull open as the right-back moved in behind. From the right he flicked over a cross but, as the ball came to Daley Blind, the left-back leant back and blazed a volley over. There followed a passage of United pressure as Valencia, Herrera and Mkhitaryan all probed down the right. But this amounted to nothing and suddenly Rojo misplaced a pass, Lazar Markovic took the ball on and Phil Jones needed to clear with a header.\n\nAround the midway point of the 45 minutes Mourinho sent out Wayne Rooney, Mata and Jesse Lingard to trot up and down the touchline. If this was a warning to those already representing United on the field, it did not buck them up. When Martial was later sent out he was greeted by the Stretford End’s ironic song about him being a waste of money.\n\nThis drew a salute from him, though there had been little to hail on the field as the interval approached. A scuffed Ibrahimovic effort was about as good as it got from either side, until some pinball stuff inside Hull’s area from Mkhitaryan and a Paul Pogba attempt that Jakupovic did well to save. Uninspiring opening halves have become the story recently for Mourinho’s team. Yet again he may have had harsh words with his players at the break. He might also have considered a personnel or formation change as Rashford, in particular, was isolated.\n\nThis occurred when the second half began with Rooney on for Michael Carrick, Pogba dropping into the latter’s midfield berth, and the captain occupying his favoured No10 position.\n\nThis did nothing initially to change United’s tempo as they enjoyed plenty of possession with no impact. Hull’s ploy was to soak up the pressure and hit the home side on the break, as they did when the sturdily built Oumar Niasse ran free and threatened David De Gea’s goal.\n\nGabriel Jesus off the mark as Manchester City rout West Ham again Read more\n\nA slick Pogba pass that beat the visitors’ defence put Ibrahimovic in on Jakupovic but the striker’s grimace at an inability to control the ball underlined a spurned opportunity. There was more frustration when Pogba found Rashford running a clever diagonal but he, too, could not capitalise. Moments later Jones limped off, making way for Smalling, Rooney hit an air-shot and, when the ball came to Ibrahimovic, he too failed to finish.\n\nOn 62 minutes Mourinho dealt his last card, taking off Mkhitaryan for Mata.\n\nAt the close Markovic beat De Gea but not his right post and United pressed to no avail.

belonged to distinguished veterans, as Peter Crouch struck a landmark goal before Everton equalised via an unfortunate deflection off Ryan Shawcross.\n\nIt was an unsatisfying result for the hosts but there was much to admire from Mark Hughes’s men, not least Crouch’s goal after seven minutes, which brought up a Premier League century for the former England striker. The previous goal scored on this ground had been Wayne Rooney’s record-breaking one for Manchester United in the 1-1 draw 11 days ago and, while this one may not be acclaimed as widely, Crouch’s achievement deserves high praise.\n\nManchester United fall short of José Mourinho’s demands in goalless draw Read more\n\nIt was certainly greeted with a jubilant roar by the locals here and the player added to the merriment by trotting out his old robot dance routine, gratifying a social media clamour for him to do exactly that on joining the 100 goals club. His first one was 15 years ago, when he launched a fine career by scoring for Queens Park Rangers against Aston Villa. To be still a crowd pleaser at 36 is good going by anyone’s standard.\n\n“It’s a great story and a great moment for everybody who was here to witness it,” said Hughes. “It was a special moment for him in his career. He’s in a select group of players who’s had a real impact at Premier League level and no one can take that from him.”\n\nCrouch’s hopes of reaching the milestone looked remote a couple of months ago as his career seemed to be petering out on the fringes of the Stoke squad. But after being cast back into the team a month ago he has discovered a hot streak and this was his fourth goal in his last six games. “He probably thought it had passed him by but he stuck at it and waited for his opportunity,” said an approving Hughes.\n\nIt was a fine team goal, too. Charlie Adam began the move by pinging a long ball over the visiting defence and into the path of Marko Arnautovic on the left wing. The Austrian sent a low cross to Crouch, who slotted into the net from close range. It was a smooth finish but Crouch joked that his robotic celebration suffered from rustiness: “I think I’ll have to retire it. Weddings and parties only now.”\n\nA more pertinent quibble could be raised against Stoke’s finishing after that. They created several more chances and could have been decisively in front by half-time. Crouch could have made a start on his second century but spurned two decent chances. Joel Robles saved his header in the 23rd minute after a cross by Adam. And three minutes later a flick by Arnautovic presented Crouch with another opportunity but he lashed a low volley inches wide from the edge of the box.\n\nAdam, too, was playing as if still in his prime. On the half-hour the 31-year-old dribbled past three flimsy challenges and dinked the ball to Arnautovic, who was on his own at the other side of the box. Robles, more alert than any defender, charged out to block the ensuing shot.\n\nGabriel Jesus off the mark as Manchester City rout West Ham again Read more\n\nEverton, for whom Morgan Schneiderlin made his first start, barely threatened until the 39th minute, when they drew level thanks to a lucky break. Kevin Mirallas picked out Seamus Coleman on the right-hand side of the box and the Irishman tried to curl a shot into the net. That is where it ended up but only because Shawcross inadvertently helped it on its way, a fact that was made clear to all the officials only after consultation between the referee, Craig Pawson, and his assistant. The goal had initially been ruled out, seemingly because one of the officials thought the offside Romelu Lukaku had applied the telling touch.\n\nDespite being level at half-time Ronald Koeman was aghast at how frequently Stoke had penetrated his five-man defence, especially down the flanks. He switched to a 4-4-2 formation for the second half. That made his team more solid and, what is more, they were first to threaten thereafter, albeit via a long-range shot by Ross Barkley that Grant saved comfortably. Adam then tried one from even further out but Robles foiled his attempt to reprise the famous goal he scored from the halfway line against Chelsea two years ago.\n\nSeeking an edge Hughes turned to Berahino in the 67th minute. The £12m recruit from West Bromwich Albion nearly made the perfect debut by lobbing Robles toward the end but Funes Mori headed off the line. Tom Davies then tried to land a late suckerpunch but Grant tipped away his header with one hand. “Overall it was a fair result,” said Koeman. “If you can’t win, don’t lose.”"}, {"date": "31/01/2017",

Arsène Wenger has commented upon his improved vantage point from in the stands. The panoramic, according to the Arsenal manager, affords him a “better view of things”‚ even if “you feel more powerless than usual”.\n\nOn a tumultuous night, when the rain tumbled down from the first whistle, Wenger watched his Premier League title hopes suffer a body blow and the feeling left him numb. It was an occasion when the Arsenal support had one eye on Chelsea’s game at Liverpool. They travel to Stamford Bridge to face the league leaders on Saturday and it felt as though Wenger’s players thought they merely had to turn here up to collect the three points.\n\nLiverpool’s Simon Mignolet saves penalty to gain point against Chelsea Read more\n\nEven Wenger suggested that complacency might have been a factor during a first-half performance that was down there with the most wretched of his recent tenure. “Did we think subconsciously we could turn up and it would be OK?” he asked. “I don’t know,” which was Wenger-speak for ‘Yes’.\n\nThere was also the damning comment from him that “mentally, we were not ready for the [physical] challenges. When you play at home, in our position, that is not normal. Everybody in the Premier League is strong physically and [to give] 90% is not enough.”\n\nThis was Watford’s night. They were brilliant in the first-half and they might have had more than the goals from Younès Kaboul and Troy Deeney to show for their superiority. Arsenal were indebted to Petr Cech for a couple of important saves and, obviously, the home team were booed off at half-time. Watford were supposed to be in a rut, having won one of their previous 10 league fixtures. They did not play like it.\n\nWalter Mazzarri noted how a clutch of his starting players had not completed 90 minutes for a while and it was inevitable that their levels would drop in the second half. There was a blitz from Arsenal at the beginning of it and they advertised the comeback through Alex Iwobi’s goal on 58 minutes.\n\nBut Watford weathered the storm and, in truth, they held their hosts at arms’ length thereafter. The Arsenal substitute Lucas Pérez rattled the crossbar with a left-foot rocket from an angle on 85 minutes but that was the only time that his team threatened the equaliser.\n\nMazzarri felt the elation pour out at full time and he would dedicate the victory to the late, great Graham Taylor, whose name was chanted by the travelling fans throughout.\n\nWatford had been two goals to the good inside 13 minutes and it was pinch-me time for them. Kaboul, the former Tottenham defender, watched his 25-yard free-kick deflect off Ramsey to wrong‑foot Cech for the opener and it was just the start of a horrible evening for the Arsenal midfielder.\n\nRamsey was caught out for Watford’s second goal and, on 18 minutes, he felt his calf muscle twang and he was forced off. Wenger said he could not put a timeframe on Ramsey’s absence but it will most likely be a minimum of three weeks.\n\nWatford’s second goal was all about the anticipation and turn of pace of another former Spurs player, Étienne Capoue. He was on to Ramsey in a flash to exploit his misjudgment on Gabriel Paulista’s poor throw-in on halfway and he lost Francis Coquelin with a nice stop-and-go move before surging around Shkodran Mustafi. Capoue’s shot hit Cech and it broke kindly for Deeney, who tapped home.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Watford’s Troy Deeney celebrates scoring. Photograph: Tony O'Brien/Reuters\n\nArsenal were a shambles in the first half – hesitant and loose, their game pockmarked by heavy touches and bad passes. Watford, though, deserve credit for the way they pressed them from their stride. Deeney ran himself into the ground, Capoue was excellent while M’Baye Niang, the loan signing from Milan, played his part off the left flank.\n\nVictor Wanyama wastes rare chance as Sunderland frustrate Tottenham Read more\n\nArsenal’s desperation was summed up when Nacho Monreal dived in the 25th minute in a bid to win a penalty off from Craig Cathcart – he was correctly booked – while Cech saved smartly from Sebastian Prodl’s looping header and Daryl Janmaat’s blast.\n\nWenger sent on Theo Walcott for the anonymous Olivier Giroud at half-time and with Alexis Sánchez moved up front they were transformed. The intensity was back and the home crowd rallied behind them. Watford’s four-man defence, comprising entirely centre-halves, were asked a simple question. Could they hang on?\n\nThe chances came at quite the rate early in the second-half – two for Walcott, one of which Heurelho Gomes saved; one for Iwobi, which saw the goalkeeper shoot out an arm to stop and one for Mesut Özil, which also worked Gomes.\n\nIwobi scored with a volley back into the far corner after dynamic work from Sánchez and it was game on but Arsenal stalled.

got so much more as goals from Scott Dann and Christian Benteke secured his first league win as Crystal Palace manager.\n\nPalace defended magnificently, nullifying Bournemouth, to record their first away victory since September and a first clean sheet against top-flight opposition under Allardyce.\n\nA combination of heavy fog, sea mist and rain showers made for a largely untidy contest, but Palace relished the battle. Allardyce’s teams have always put up a fight and he was delighted with his team’s resolute display, capped by Benteke’s injury-time header that put the gloss on a priceless result in their fight for Premier League survival.\n\n“I have been a long time waiting,” Allardyce said. “I have been asking the players to make some slight changes and working around different ideas to help them perform better and get better results. I thought we executed the gameplan exceptionally well.”\n\nAllardyce was not so effusive on the January transfer deadline, however. “I had a player asking me today if I have put him up for sale,” he said. “You have players being told information that is not true and when you have a player saying that, it shows just how bad this window is and our job is already hard enough.”\n\nIt was fitting that Harry Redknapp, part of the deadline-day furniture in years gone by, watched on from the stands. Also in the posh seats was Steve Parish, the Crystal Palace chairman, on his phone for much of the first half, presumably wrapping up the signings of the Liverpool defender Mamadou Sakho and Luka Milivojevic, who officially joined from Olympiakos shortly after the full-time whistle. Everton’s Arouna Koné was also on their wish list, Allardyce said.\n\nTroy Deeney scores Watford winner as Arsenal title hopes fade Read more\n\nPalace made seven changes from the FA Cup defeat at home against Manchester City on Saturday, with Wilfried Zaha back in the starting lineup for the first time since returning from the Africa Cup of Nations with the Ivory Coast. Andros Townsend, a loan target for his former club Newcastle United, was among Allardyce’s substitutes.\n\nIt was 10 days since Bournemouth’s last match, a draw here against Watford, and it showed with Eddie Howe’s side sluggish out of the blocks.\n\nZaha was back with a bounce, causing no end of problems for the home side, twirling away from Brad Smith one moment and leaving Joshua King for dead the next. Zaha rattled the post inside four minutes after toying with Andrew Surman on the edge of the box before Patrick van Aanholt, making his first appearance in a Palace shirt since his £12m move from Sunderland, kickstarted another move. The wing-back drilled in a cross that pinballed off Benteke and Steve Cook before Zaha’s fierce shot was kept out by Boruc.\n\nAllardyce must have worried, with little to show for an impressive 45 minutes. But Palace were rewarded for their efforts 60 seconds into the second half, when Bournemouth were punished for failing to clear their lines. Jason Puncheon picked up the ball on the left flank and his cross was stabbed home by Dann after Damian Delaney’s flick-on.\n\nSam Vokes pounces late as buoyant Burnley beat Leicester City Read more\n\nBournemouth grew increasingly frustrated in the physical battle and Jack Wilshere was fortunate not to be booked for dissent by Jon Moss after walking away from the referee after a petty challenge on Yohan Cabaye. King had a couple of half-chances but Palace forced Bournemouth to feed off scraps.\n\nBournemouth searched for an equaliser in vain as Palace stood firm, led by Dann, and urged forward by Allardyce in the closing stages.\n\nThe four minutes of added time were agonising for Palace, with Wilshere’s low free-kick hitting the upright after a fingertip save by Wayne Hennessey. But soon Allardyce could relax, high-fiving his assistant, Sammy Lee, and the coaching staff, safe in the knowledge of victory, when Benteke nodded home Townsend’s lofted cross.\n\nBournemouth struggled to cope with Palace’s aerial ability and were second best for large spells. In the buildup to the fixture Howe said his squad have been stimulated by different team-bonding exercises, including a visit from Sir Clive Woodward, who won the Rugby World Cup with England in 2003, and a spending an afternoon watching the local 6 Rifles regiment, based at Poole, go about their business. But Bournemouth, who have not added to their first-team squad this window, lacked bite and have won one of their past seven matches.\n\nEven more worrying is their defensive resolve, conceding 15 goals in their past seven home games. “We are going through a difficult period and the players’ confidence has been knocked slightly,” said Howe, who also confirmed attempts to re-sign the Chelsea defender Nathan Aké on a temporary and permanent basis. “There were a lot sideways and backward passes that we do not want but when you are not feeling good about yourself it’s the easiest thing to do.”\n\nThis was a huge stride forward for Big Sam and Palace, though."}, {"date": "31/01/2017", "arena": "Turf Moor", "attendance": 19202, "home_team": {"name": "Burnley", "lineup": [{"name": "Tom

were annoyed by the manner of Sam Vokes’s winner, after the Burnley substitute appeared to control the ball with his hand before smashing it into the roof of the net.\n\nThe Premier League’s defending champions could have few other complaints. They are simply not producing enough going forward to hurt opponents as they did so effectively last season and Burnley were rarely in danger of being caught on the counter.\n\nHanging on for a goalless draw is always dangerous, especially as Burnley had created more than enough chances to win here, though Leicester must have thought they had a point after Andre Gray and Vokes both missed decent chances in the closing minutes.\n\nThe Clarets are now eight points ahead of Leicester in the table, which is surely a safe enough place to be, and in addition to a controversial three points the club were able to announce the deadline-day signings of Robbie Brady and Ashley Westwood. Leicester are just two points above the drop zone and in trouble, vulnerable to any sort of improvement by Swansea or Crystal Palace.\n\n“We can say it was handball, but the referee did not see it and the referee is always right,” Claudio Ranieri said diplomatically. “Burnley won, well done to them. We battled, but our final ball was maybe not good enough. We still have work to do.”\n\nLeicester began the match as if they meant business, with Marc Albrighton making inroads down the left wing, though Burnley proved effective at closing down his crosses and gradually the home forwards began to feature in the game. Ashley Barnes sent the first shot of the evening just wide from a flick by Gray, then George Boyd saw an attempt blocked by Robert Huth.\n\nBy the mid-point of the first half Burnley were getting on top, with Leicester pinned back in their own half and becoming increasingly hopeful in their attempts to hit the isolated Jamie Vardy with long balls forward.\n\nThe Turf Moor crowd were incensed a few minutes before the interval when Michael Keane appeared to be impeded by Danny Drinkwater as he rose to meet Jeff Hendrick’s cross. The referee, Mike Dean, waved away appeals for a penalty and was similarly unimpressed when Danny Simpson and Barnes came together the next time the ball came into the area.\n\nAll Burnley had to show for their first‑half dominance were a couple of well-struck shots from Joey Barton that flew too high, and they could have been punished on the stroke of the interval but for some equally poor finishing from the visitors. A chance to put a free-kick into the Burnley penalty area right at the end of the half offered a welcome respite for a side finding it hard to cross the halfway line, but though Wes Morgan rose unchallenged to Albrighton’s cross he put his header over the bar.\n\nBurnley still had to be careful. In a rare reprise of what used to happen regularly last season Riyad Mahrez produced a second-half run and a dipping shot that Tom Heaton could not hold at the first attempt, but in a cruel example of what hardly ever happened last season Vardy was not on the scene quite quickly enough to take advantage.\n\nGray, Michael Keane and Hendrick all saw shots blocked in quick succession as Burnley attempted to cash in on a couple of corners and a spell of pressure midway through the second half, before the dangerous Gray broke into the box and stayed on his feet despite Huth’s attempts to wrestle him to the floor.\n\nGray’s eventual shot was blocked by Morgan for a corner, from which Ben Mee missed the target with a free header from the six-yard line, yet they might have had a penalty had their player gone to ground instead of shrugging off an illegal challenge.\n\nIt was a similar situation to the one involving Raheem Sterling against Tottenham Hotspur at the Etihad Stadium recently. If players are to be encouraged to stay on their feet wherever possible and not exaggerate every contact at the earliest opportunity, it would help if officials could spot obvious fouls without waiting for histrionic assistance.\n\nYet what comes around goes around, and though Vokes’s goal should have been disallowed following Scott Arfield’s corner, at least Dean and his assistants managed to aggrieve both parties.\n\nThat will be little comfort to Leicester should their survival come down to a single‑point margin at the end of the season, but as far as Sean Dyche is concerned luck does even itself out. “We’ve had a few decisions go against us this season and I think we deserved the win,” the Burnley manager said. “We kept knocking on the door and in the end we got our reward.”"},

week in which Aitor Karanka made his feelings about Middlesbrough’s transfer activity clear, this all-too-familiar performance did not change his train of thought. Boro demonstrated a steady defence, competent midfield but the kind of anodyne attack that can cause a team to slide steadily towards the trap.\n\nThis was perhaps a fair result after an entertaining game although West Bromwich Albion were far the more dangerous attacking proposition. James Morrison gave them the lead and Boro equalised through Álvaro Negredo’s penalty, before Tony Pulis’s team struck the post twice in the second half.\n\nLiverpool’s Simon Mignolet saves penalty to gain point against Chelsea Read more\n\nIt means Middlesbrough have not won a league game in six – since mid-December – and continue their struggles in the final third. The January signings Patrick Bamford and Rudy Gestede were late substitutes but they made little impact, as Karanka ponders an end-of-season run with little proven firepower. The Watford midfielder Adlène Guedioura was signed on deadline day but major targets were missed.\n\n“I think as a coach you can’t demand anything more from your players. We knew it was going to be a tough game. They [West Brom] are a really good side, they are experienced, have quality and are strong,” said Karanka, who confirmed that the out-of-favour Gaston Ramírez would not be leaving the club this season.\n\n“Today has been another good example that it’s difficult to compete with teams like West Brom. Even when we were doing our best they had chances to score. They looked more experienced and stronger than us. I am happy now because I see my players fighting. The commitment once again has been amazing. With the spirit of the team I’m really confident for the future.”\n\nThe match started terribly for Boro, who fell behind to a strike from one of their academy products. Albion swung in a corner from the left and after a melee inside the penalty area Darren Fletcher managed to steer the ball back out to the edge of the area. Morrison was waiting and he swept the ball first time low and into Victor Valdés’s bottom-left corner.\n\nVictor Wanyama wastes rare chance as Sunderland frustrate Tottenham Read more\n\nHowever, Boro were soon level. It was against the flow of the match but Negredo was certainly grateful, winning a penalty after being challenged by Gareth McAuley. The defender did get a toe on the ball but to get there he had scythed the Spanish striker in two. Negredo calmly rolled the ball in past Ben Foster and Middlesbrough were a team renewed.\n\nAdama Traoré was his usual lively self, and his final delivery seemed improved. He even produced a fine block to deny Salomón Rondón as the striker moved in on goal, before Boro came close to being awarded a second penalty. Allan Nyom clearly tripped Cristhian Stuani in a tangle of legs but the referee, Stuart Atwell, was unmoved.\n\nBoro increased their intensity after half-time but struggled to craft any clear scoring opportunities. In contrast, West Brom were not finding their fluency of the opening quarter yet they should have gone in front once more.\n\nNacer Chadli found space down the right and chipped an inviting ball into the centre. There was Matt Phillips, running in at pace, but the midfielder’s diving header smacked Valdés’s left-hand post, before Rondón sliced the rebound on to the opposite post.\n\nSam Vokes pounces late as buoyant Burnley beat Leicester City Read more\n\nPulis was satisfied with a point, although he did not believe the penalty should have been given and also revealed that Rondón was not on top form because of a family issue.\n\n“I don’t think it’s a penalty,” Pulis said. “Gareth touches the ball but he shouldn’t have slid in anyway. That changed it, knocked us back. But in the second half I thought we were the team that was eventually going to win the game. We had two great opportunities.\n\n“There’s lots of stuff going round with Salomón. We have to make sure he’s focused. We’ll look after him, he’s a good lad. It’s a personal thing with his family back in Venezuela. We understand where he is at the moment but he worked his socks off for an hour.”\n\nKaranka brought on Bamford with 20 minutes remaining but Boro continued to struggle in the final third.

"report": "As a masterclass in how to stop Tottenham Hotspur, Sunderland’s performance proved near faultless but, textbook as David Moyes’s spoiling tactics undoubtedly were, the upshot was mutual frustration.\n\nIf Mauricio Pochettino could barely disguise his disappointment at a draw which leaves his Tottenham Hotspur side a receding title threat in Chelsea’s rear view mirror, the Wearsiders really need wins if they are to stand a realistic chance of staying in the Premier League. While Pochettino’s second placed players remain nine points behind the leaders, second bottom Sunderland are five adrift of fourth bottom.\n\nAt least the latter’s enthusiasm for getting in their guests’ faces before delighting in forcing them down repeated dead attacking ends offers a semblance of hope at the end of an evening when Spurs looked badly in need of some winter sun.\n\n“I’m a bit disappointed but I don’t believe we were tired,” said Pochettino. “We should have won. It was a massive opportunity to close the gap on Chelsea.” In contrast Moyes grasped all available positives. “The players should take a lot of pride from their performance,” he said. “They stuck at it defensively against a really good team with some of Britain’s finest young talents.”\n\nIt helped his cause that he had Lamine Koné and Didier Ndong back from Africa Cup of Nations duty and both did well. If Ndong’s energy blunted Spurs’ midfield edge, Koné quickly proved his worth, the central defender making a fine block to prevent Son Heung-min connecting with Harry Kane’s dangerous early cross.\n\nSam Vokes pounces late as buoyant Burnley beat Leicester City Read more\n\nSunderland’s manager is not really a fan of back threes but, lacking a specialist left back in the wake of Patrick van Aanholt’s defection to Crystal Palace, he opted for a 3-5-2 formation, featuring Billy Jones and Javier Manquillo as wing backs.\n\nWell, that was the theory: in reality they rapidly retreated into back five mode as Michel Vorm, deputising for the unwell Hugo Lloris in the visiting goal, struggled to keep warm on a damp, raw Wearside night.\n\nWhen Vorm finally had a routine Fabio Borini shot to save, its tameness perhaps highlighted precisely why Moyes was so disappointed to have failed in concerted attempts to buy a new attacking partner for the isolated Spurs old boy, Jermain Defoe. “It wasn’t for want of trying,” said the Scot. “We knew it was going to be a difficult window.”\n\nIf Moyes feared Vito Mannone was in for a difficult evening, the goalkeeper confounded him, setting the tone by pushing Victor Wanyama’s 20-yard shot round a post before Sunderland benefited from some refereeing leniency.\n\nJust as Mousa Dembélé appeared to have finally deconstructed that packed, bloody minded, defence he was sent crashing to earth courtesy of a late, high and thoroughly reckless tackle from Jack Rodwell. Lee Mason promptly showed the midfielder a yellow card but there was a fairly compelling argument that it should have been red.\n\nInstead the challenge’s blood curdling nature galvanised the crowd and as, suddenly, Sunderland poured forward, Ben Davies – on for Danny Rose who had injured a knee – sliced a clearance into the path of Jones whose cross for Defoe might have prefaced a goal had Toby Alderweireld not intercepted.\n\nAt the outset of the second half, Borini did escape on the counterattack, only to end up ballooning his eventual shot over Vorm’s bar. All industry and minimal incision or real invention, that little cameo appeared emblematic of the attacking side of a Sunderland side let down by awful set piece execution.\n\nTroy Deeney scores Watford winner as Arsenal title hopes fade Read more\n\nSpurs though were pretty low on their customary improvisation too. So low, that shivering in the technical area, Pochettino cut an increasingly frustrated figure as he watched Dele Alli, Christian Eriksen and company persistently run into attacking cul-de-sacs.\n\nWhen Ndong hacked Alli down the visitors won a free-kick in classic Eriksen territory and his subtly curving delivery did not disappoint. Fortunately for Moyes, Mannone proved equal to it, saving well to prevent the ball squeezing inside a post before, subsequently, diving low to keep a subsequent Son effort out.\n\nTurning creator, Son seized the fall out from a partially cleared corner and crossed superbly. The unmarked Wanyama should have headed Tottenham’s best chance home but, instead, the midfielder lost balance as he leapt and the ball arced over Mannone’s bar, leaving Pochettino muttering furiously to himself.\n\n“The team spirit was tremendous,” said Moyes. “The togetherness of the players gives us something to build on. We need to keep making as many tackles as we made tonight.”"}, {"date": "31/01/2017", "arena": "The Liberty Stadium", "attendance": 20359, "home_team": {"name": "Swansea City", "lineup": [{"name": "Lukasz Fabianski", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Naughton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Federico Fernandez", "yellows": [82], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alfie Mawson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [38], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Olsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [76]}, {"name": "Leroy Fer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [72]}, {"name": "Jack Cork", "yellows": [44], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Carroll", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wayne Routledge", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [60]}, {"name": "Fernando Llorente", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gylfi Sigurdsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [70], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Jordi Amat", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sung-Yueng Ki", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [72], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Borja González", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathan Dyer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kristoffer Nordfeldt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Angel Rangel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [76], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Luciano Narsingh", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [60], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Southampton", "lineup": [{"name": "Fraser Forster", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cédric Soares", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Stephens", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Maya Yoshida", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Bertrand", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Davis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Oriol Romeu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordy Clasie", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [76]}, {"name": "Dusan Tadic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [56]}, {"name": "Shane Long", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [57], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathan Redmond", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [76]}], "subs": [{"name": "Florin Gardos", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harrison Reed", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sofiane Boufal", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [56], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pierre-Emile Højbjerg", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stuart Taylor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sam McQueen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [76], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joshua Sims", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [76], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "It is amazing what a shot of confidence can do for a team. Seemingly resigned to relegation at the end of December, Swansea City signed off January with a third victory in four Premier League matches to continue their upward momentum under Paul Clement and give their survival chances another huge boost.\n\nSwansea remain only one place above the relegation zone, yet crucially they are now level on points with Middlesbrough and Leicester City, the two clubs immediately above them, in a survival battle that is growing in numbers. The key for Swansea is that they are the form side in the bottom six and playing with the sort of courage, spirit and belief that was so badly lacking prior to Clement’s arrival as manager.\n\nSam Vokes pounces late as buoyant Burnley beat Leicester City Read more\n\nThey also have an outstanding individual in Gylfi Sigurdsson, whose impressive performance against Southampton underlined once again why he is so invaluable to this Swansea side. Sigurdsson created the first goal, which Alfie Mawson headed in at the near post via a deflection off Oriol Romeu, and later scored the winner, just as he did at Anfield 10 days earlier.\n\nThe Icelander has now been involved directly in 14 Premier League goals this season, scoring seven and setting up another seven, and life without him is unthinkable for Swansea. The fact that Sigurdsson’s goal here was set up by Luciano Narsingh, who made his debut as a second-half substitute, gave Clement additional satisfaction at the end of a match that finished with the manager clenching his fist in the air.\n\nThere was relief as well as euphoria in that celebration after Southampton laid siege to the Swansea goal in the final 15 minutes. Claude Puel was unable to conceal his frustration at times as he jumped around on the touchline, exasperated with the opportunities that went begging on an evening when Southampton were entitled to feel that they deserved a point.\n\nLiverpool’s Simon Mignolet saves penalty to gain point against Chelsea Read more\n\nShane Long’s equaliser, following a flowing move down the Southampton left early in the second half, shifted the balance of the game in the visitors’ favour as they began to attack with more conviction. Yet it was Sigurdsson, with a low left-footed volley from Narsingh’s cross, who delivered the defining moment in the match to give Swansea back-to-back Premier League victories for the first time this season.\n\n“The equalising goal was a blow, but the players responded well, kept their spirit and kept their confidence and scored a really good goal on the counterattack,” Clement said. “After that we were under a lot of pressure, a lot of balls coming into our box, which on the whole we dealt with very well. So it was a mixed performance but a massive, massive result to back up what we did against Liverpool.:\n\nClement acknowledged Sigurdsson’s contribution, with and without the ball. “He’s a fantastic deliverer of set-plays, he really works at that so credit to him, and it was a wonderful finish from Narsingh’s pass,” Swansea’s manager said. “The ball was a little behind Gylfi but he twisted well and finished with a lot of quality. But I would also like to commend him on his work ethic defensively. People ask me whether he’s alright playing out on the left and say he likes to play centrally. I’ve never had that conversation with him. He’s just done exactly what I’ve asked him to do.”\n\nIt was Sigurdsson’s corner kick that Mawson headed home, via Romeu and the inside of the near post, to put Swansea ahead in the 38th minute. Although Southampton had started well and controlled the first 10 minutes, Swansea’s opening goal was coming after a bright spell from the home team. Fraser Forster saved well from Leroy Fer and also denied Sigurdsson.\n\nTransfer deadline day: Burnley sign Robbie Brady from Norwich for £13m – live!

A slick goal just before the hour mark provided the answer. Steven Davis fed Ryan Bertrand with a measured pass in the space that opened up on the Southampton left, and the England international’s excellent low centre was turned in by Long, who did not have to break his stride.\n\nNathan Redmond then wasted a decent chance before drawing a fingertip save from Lukasz Fabianski as Southampton pressed for a second goal. Indeed it was a Southampton corner that led to Swansea’s winner as Fernando Llorente headed clear and Tom Carroll released Narsingh over the top. The substitute’s pass left Sigurdsson with plenty of work still to do but he wrapped his left foot around the ball and steered it beyond Forster, into the far corner of the net."}, {"date":

that unless something dramatic happens the Premier League title is on its way back to Stamford Bridge. They will be full of regret, naturally, after Diego Costa’s failure to convert the penalty that would have meant Liverpool losing four successive games at Anfield for the first time since 1923. Yet this still registers as a satisfying night’s work for Antonio Conte’s men in a new position of strength at the top of the table.\n\nTroy Deeney scores Watford winner as Arsenal title hopes fade Read more\n\nIt certainly felt incongruous to see Jürgen Klopp beating his chest and throwing his hands to the sky as the Liverpool manager made his way to the tunnel after the final whistle. Yes, it had been a spirited effort from his players, but at this stage of the season should a team in Liverpool position really be so enamoured about failing to make any ground on the leaders?\n\nThe harsh reality is that Liverpool have won one of their past nine matches in all competitions and in the past 11 days they have gone out of two cup competitions and, almost certainly, forfeited any lingering chance of winning their first championship since 1990. Chelsea have preserved a 10-point advantage over the team in fourth and, taking into account the results elsewhere for Tottenham and Arsenal, they might eventually look back at this draw as being a significant result.\n\nThat, however, does not mean they will be free of frustration after a night that encapsulated the good and bad of Simon Mignolet, Liverpool’s puzzling goalkeeper. Mignolet was badly exposed when David Luiz opened the scoring with a quickly taken free-kick in the 24th minute and it was startling to see someone purporting to be an elite goalkeeper being caught out in such a way. His save from Costa’s penalty provided a counter‑argument although the point remains that a team with Liverpool’s ambitions could benefit from having a goalkeeper who does not mix outstanding reflexes with damaging lapses.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest David Luiz puts Chelsea into the lead with a long-distance free kick. Photograph: Phil Noble/Reuters\n\nLiverpool played at times like they knew they had a season to save. They had the better of the first 20 minutes and dominated long spells of the second half, equalising via Georgino Wijnaldum’s header, until the game threatened to head away from them in the last quarter of an hour. Another team’s confidence might have been damaged by their recent slump but there was no evidence of that here – and that, perhaps, was the most impressive aspect of Liverpool’s performance.\n\nIt earned them some sympathetic applause at the final whistle, but there was palpable frustration, too, and Klopp went too far when he turned on the fourth official, Neil Swarbrick, after the penalty. Klopp did apologise, but it was still unpleasant to see him screaming into Swarbrick’s face. He said that his words were “nobody can beat us” – a strange observation bearing in mind how distressing January has been for his club.\n\nKlopp, as always, was immensely wound up and earlier in the match, as he informed the supporters behind his dugout that he wanted more noise, it was noticeable that his request did not go down well with all the fans in that stand. Chelsea had scored a couple of minutes earlier and Mignolet was not even looking at the ball when David Luiz, showing great speed of thought, took a few steps forward and aimed a 25-yard shot over what barely passed as a defensive wall. Adam Lallana, Jordan Henderson and Roberto Firmino were all lined up and Philippe Coutinho was making his way over.\n\nLiverpool 1-1 Chelsea: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nLiverpool, in other words, did not have a single defender in their wall, which might help to explain why the four players in question looked like they were idly waiting at a bus stop. Mignolet had wandered from one side of his goal to the other and David Luiz impudently aimed the ball in precisely the spot the Belgian had deserted.\n\nLiverpool, to give them their due, shook their heads clear for the second half and the equaliser arrived in the 57th minute when James Milner headed Henderson’s right-sided delivery back across the six-yard area. The ball came to Wijnaldum via a slight deflection off Victor Moses and the Liverpool player aimed a downward header beyond Thibaut Courtois.\n\nKlopp brought on Sadio Mané, back from the Africa Cup of Nations, in the hope he might conjure up a winner and Klopp could reflect on the two chances Firmino squandered in the first half.\n\nYet it was Chelsea who finished as the stronger side and Costa had the opportunity to win the match after the referee, Mark Clattenburg, decided that Joël Matip had flicked out a leg to halt the striker’s surging run. Costa struck the penalty with power but Mignolet dived to his right to turn the ball away and Liverpool were spared."}, {"date": "22/01/2017", "arena": " Mary's Stadium", "attendance": 30548,

Ranieri insists the blame should lay at his door after Southampton stopped a rot of their own to breeze past the reigning champions.\n\nJames Ward-Prowse created one and scored another with a sweeping right-footed effort before Dusan Tadic’s late penalty, to push Saints back in the right direction and leave Leicester going the other way.\n\nSouthampton 3-0 Leicester City: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nNobody has been more baffled by Leicester’s dreadful away form than Ranieri but the Italian blamed himself for his side’s laborious display on the south coast. “I tried to change the system to help my players find the solution but it’s much better to maintain the normal way,” Ranieri said, alluding to his decision to play a midfield diamond. “I think it’s better to give them something we know. There are no excuses. Southampton were the better team and deserved to win. But I take responsibility for our shape.”\n\nIt was another inept Leicester display, particularly defensively, and their record on the road in the league this season now reads: eight defeats, three draws, zero wins. Unfortunately for Leicester, they have to board the surely dreaded team bus for four of their next five matches. The numbers are even more bizarre considering the Foxes lost just twice away from the King Power Stadium last season.\n\nLeicester remain just three points above Swansea City – seemingly doomed to relegation only a couple of weeks ago – and only five above the drop zone.\n\nIt was a turgid Leicester performance, with Demarai Gray the Foxes’ only real attacking outlet. Jamie Vardy, who scored twice in this fixture last season, was so well marshalled by Maya Yoshida and Virgil van Dijk, named captain here after José Fonte’s departure, that the striker failed to register a single shot on goal.\n\nThe opening 10 minutes felt very familiar, with Southampton dominating possession but again wasteful inside the opposition box. Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg fired harmlessly over from Ryan Bertrand’s low cross and Nathan Redmond should have done far better with a free header after fleeing the attentions of Christian Fuchs to meet Tadic’s rising cross three minutes later. Wilfred Ndidi then handed the ball to Saints, much to the anger of an animated Ranieri, and the Serbia winger again supplied Redmond but Kasper Schmeichel saved low to his left.\n\nBoth teams had appeared short of finding an end product until Ward-Prowse’s opener. Cédric Soares burst in behind Fuchs and cut back for the Southampton midfielder, who, first time, curled an effort into the corner of Schmeichel’s goal. The 22-year-old has already equalled last year’s goal tally.\n\nWard-Prowse capped a superb all-round midfield performance with only his fifth league goal for the club, one witnessed by the watching England manager, Gareth Southgate. Ward-Prowse, who made his top-flight debut against Manchester City in 2012, has badly struggled for consistency and has long needed to add goals to his repertoire. Ward-Prowse is of course no stranger to Southgate, having worked with him in the England Under-21s setup.\n\nLeicester’s Premier League title defence summed up by their travel sickness Read more\n\nSouthgate presumably had his eye on current internationals Vardy, Danny Drinkwater and Bertrand but it was Ward-Prowse who made the biggest impression.\n\n“I think since the beginning of the season he has made good progress,” Claude Puel, the Southampton manager, said of Ward-Prowse. “He takes confidence and it is important also because it gives situations with a good right foot on the free-kicks. This gives us opportunities to score like the second goal for example. We have many players for three places but it is interesting to see James at this level and scoring. This is very important.”\n\nWard-Prowse then turned provider, whipping in a trademark right-footed free-kick, nodded down by Yoshida before Jay Rodriguez fired low beyond Schmeichel. Ranieri summoned Marc Albrighton at half-time but things did not improve. Not even Islam Slimani or Riyad Mahrez, almost 4,000 miles away with Algeria at the Africa Cup of Nations, could have aided the self-inflicted wounds, typified by Wes Morgan’s clumsy challenge on the substitute Shane Long for Tadic’s penalty and Southampton’s deserved third.\n\nLeicester have now conceded more league goals than they did in the entirety of last season.\n\nThe only bum note for Puel could be the ankle injury sustained by Van Dijk 10 minutes into the second half. The Saints youngster Jack Stephens replaced the Dutchman but Puel is down to bare bones defensively for Wednesday’s EFL Cup semi-final second leg against Liverpool.\n\n“He took a big kick and we will see if we can recover him for this game,” Puel said. “He could not continue the game. We will see for the next games. I hope we can have Virgil of course because he is our captain and he’s an important player.”\n\nYoshida could have got in on the act too, but his goal was ruled out for offside by the referee, Michael Oliver. With Southampton already celebrating, Ward-Prowse urged his team-mates to defend Leicester’s pending attack from inside his own half. It could prove to be a match Ward-Prowse looks back on with great significance."}, {"date": "22/01/2017", "arena": "Emirates Stadium", "attendance": 59955, "home_team": {"name": "Arsenal", "lineup": [{"name": "Petr Cech", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gabriel Paulista", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shkodran Mustafi", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [59], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Laurent Koscielny", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nacho Monreal", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Ramsey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Granit Xhaka", "yellows": [], "reds": [65], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex Iwobi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [69]}, {"name": "Mesut Özil", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [89]}, {"name": "Alexis Sánchez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [90], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Olivier Giroud", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [87]}], "subs": [{"name": "Kieran Gibbs", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lucas Pérez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Ospina", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Welbeck", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [87], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Hector Bellerin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [89], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Francis Coquelin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [69], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Burnley", "lineup": [{"name": "Tom Heaton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matthew Lowton", "yellows": [58], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Keane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Mee", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stephen Ward", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "George Boyd", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dean Marney", "yellows": [74], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [76]}, {"name": "Jeff Hendrick", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [73]}, {"name": "Steven Defour", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [77]}, {"name": "Andre Gray", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [90], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Barnes", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Jon Flanagan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sam Vokes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [77], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Kightly", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paul Robinson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joey Barton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [73], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Tarkowski", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [76], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tendayi Darikwa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "With the pack chasing Chelsea dropping points all around them this weekend, a win – any win, even a boring, routine, nothing remarkable win – would have been welcomed by Arsenal. But a victory of this theatrically charged fashion sent the Emirates crowd into a rare frenzy. Humdrum, run of the mill, this was not.\n\nMuch of the most captivating drama was condensed into the seven and a bit minutes of stoppage time. Until then Arsenal had been leading Burnley, protecting a narrow lead with 10 men after Granit Xhaka’s sending off. The mood lurched one way as Burnley were awarded a penalty. Petr Cech made contact with his hand but not strongly enough as Gray equalised. Burnley’s players were overjoyed. Arsenal’s felt the fear.\n\nArsène Wenger was sent from the dugout for letting his emotions out on the fourth official.\n\nArsène Wenger may face ban following altercation with fourth official Read more\n\nExtraordinarily, the mood lurched again in the final seconds as Ben Mee caught Laurent Koscielny in the face with a high foot. Another penalty. Now it was Burnley’s turn to dread the game being snatched from them, and their reaction was intensified by complaints that the Arsenal defender was in an offside position when Mee caught him.\n\nAlexis Sánchez took the responsibility with a flourish as he dinked the ball straight down the middle. Once the dust had settled, at the end of it all, while Burnley were entitled to feel deeply disappointed Arsenal showed the character to take on some adversity and come out of it sitting second in the Premier League. Sean Dyche generously recognised that. “Credit to them they didn’t stop either. They kept coming with 10 men.”\n\nNaturally he was galled to see a precious point on the road, something Burnley have found difficult to come by, disappearing in such difficult circumstances. But Dyche is very much from the school that whatever doesn’t break you makes you stronger. “You get a dent but you don’t get broke,” he said.\n\nBurnley put a great deal of effort into the game. Once they settled down after a flurry of early chances for Arsenal they found a more resilient structure and were able to threaten on the counter-attack.\n\nFor all the glitz of Aaron Ramsey’s rabona cross, Olivier Giroud’s attempted overhead or Mesut Özil’s deft flick, Burnley kept diligently picking up the pieces, and the readiness of Andre Gray and Ashley Barnes to spring forward kept Arsenal on their toes. Just before half-time Cech had to come out bravely to be first in a race with Gray to get to George Boyd’s teasing cross.\n\nArsenal tested Burnley, with Sánchez the chief danger man, and their resistance was broken from a set piece, as Shkodran Mustafi expertly steered Özil’s corner at the inside netting of the far post. It was a fine header – the German’s first goal for the club since signing last summer from Valencia.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Granit Xhaka is shown a red card by referee Jon Moss. Photograph: Julian Finney/Getty Images\n\nA relatively comfortable situation suddenly became awkward when Xhaka was sent off in the 64th minute for a clumsy tackle on Steven Defour. Having lost the ball the Swiss midfielder tried to win it back but the challenge was late and with feet off the ground. Xhaka will be banned for four games, having already been sent off this season (by the same referee, Jon Moss, incidentally) against Swansea City in October.\n\nWenger’s patience with Xhaka wore noticeably thin. “He has to control his game and not punish the team with a lack of control in his tackling,” he said afterwards.\n\nWith the extra body Burnley stepped up a gear. Defour tested Cech with a free kick. Dean Marney raised the temperature with a hefty scissor challenge to stop Özil on the break. Sánchez was back in his own box making emergency clearances. On came Joey Barton and Sam Vokes to try to turn the screw.\n\nArsenal found respite and Francis Coquelin and Danny Welbeck threatened the killer second just before the end of regulation time, before the helter-skelter dramatics took over as the 90 minutes ticked into overtime.\n\nThe Dozen: the weekend's best Premier League photos Read more\n\nWhen Coquelin chopped at Barnes and a penalty was awarded, Wenger’s outburst ensured it would not only be Xhaka who would feel ashamed at the end of it all. The manager later expressed his remorse after being sent from the touchline for a verbal exchange with fourth official Anthony Taylor. “I regret everything. I should have shut up, gone in and go home. I apologise for that.”\n\nWenger was in the bowels of the Emirates when the drama twisted again as Moss gave a penalty Arsenal’s way. “We had to work really hard to get something and we get back in it. You can’t believe the decision,” lamented Dyche. Sánchez delivered the game’s final devastating swipe from the spot.\n\nA cool penalty? “Too cool,” said Wenger. “Sánchez missed penalties for us.

The Chelsea striker had been offered an immediate return to the starting lineup after an unsettling period disrupted by lower back spasms and Chinese whispers, and ultimately that absence at Leicester last weekend. Yet here he was departing four minutes from time with the majority in this arena chorusing his name, to be greeted by a thumped hand clap from Antonio Conte on the touchline, as the man who had paved the way for an eight-point lead at the top. His scriptwriters should take a bow.\n\nChelsea have no interest in selling their leading scorer this month, whether Tianjin Quanjian or any of their Chinese Super League rivals are tempted to offer £80m, £100m or indeed £150m for his services. His long-term future will have to be properly addressed with the player and his agent, Jorge Mendes, in the summer, of course, but for now reintegration already feels almost complete unless those back pains return with a vengeance. The forward was at his committed best here, working feverishly whether leading the line or dropping deep to assist his team-mates. He played the role of “Costa the manager’s dream”, as he has done almost all season, to perfection.\n\nHull’s Ryan Mason in stable condition after fracturing skull at Chelsea Read more\n\nHull will take heart from their rugged resistance as they contemplate their ongoing battle against relegation, and could justifiably bemoan the non-award of a penalty for Marcos Alonso’s foul on Abel Hernández when their deficit was only one, but this was always going to be the Spain forward’s day. “People were asking me about his form, his attitude, and I said I would always take the best decision for the team,” said Conte. “I think, after this performance, I did make the best decision. The most important thing for us was for him to answer on the pitch.” Costa undoubtedly did just that.\n\nHis decisive intervention had actually come almost eight minutes into stoppage time at the end of an otherwise frustrating first half. Chelsea, for all their monopoly of possession, had run aground too often on Marco Silva’s well-drilled ranks with Hull’s resolve undisturbed even by the loss of Ryan Mason after a sickening clash of heads with Gary Cahill just after the quarter-hour mark. The former Tottenham Hotspur midfielder, a Chelsea supporter as a child, had received oxygen while lying prone on the turf undergoing treatment from members of both clubs’ medical staff. He departed on a stretcher and was rushed to the acute care unit at St Mary’s Hospital where he underwent surgery on Sunday evening having suffered a fractured skull. His recovery is Hull’s true priority.\n\nHull had reorganised impressively enough, only to be prised apart just as they were contemplating the break, and bemoaning the lack of a free-kick for Cahill’s tug back on Hernández. Victor Moses squeezed space away from Andy Robertson down the flank and pulled his centre back across the muddle of bodies in the six-yard box. Costa had held himself slightly back, easing himself away from Harry Maguire, and connected truly.\n\nHis side-foot shot flew in off Eldin Jakupovic’s left boot for a 15th league goal of the term. The celebrations, pinching thumb and fingers together with his hands lifted to his ears, presumably suggested there had been too much chat around the events of the last fortnight.\n\nAlexis Sánchez scores 98th-minute penalty in dramatic Arsenal win over Burnley Read more\n\nSuch is the improvement in this Hull team under Silva that this was never a stroll thereafter, with the trip on Hernández surely worthy of a spot-kick had it been spied by the referee Neil Swarbrick or his assistant. Yet, while the impressive, marauding Maguire tested Thibaut Courtois from close range and long distance, the visitors finally yielded nine minutes from time. The substitute Cesc Fàbregas arced a free-kick into the six-yard box where another replacement, Oumar Niasse, mystifyingly ducked and Sam Clucas dawdled, allowing Cahill a free header from point-blank range. Conte had considered substituting his captain at the interval, such had been the severity of that clash with Mason. He ended up reserving his biggest bear hug of the day for the triumphant centre-back.\n\nThat gap from Arsenal in second place already yawns dauntingly wide for the chasing pack, with Chelsea having won 15 of their last 16 games and shed only 11 points all season. No one has been capable of hauling in their sprint to the summit. Their feat in accumulating 55 points after 22 games has been achieved only four times in the Premier League era, with this club contributing two of those eye-catching tallies under José Mourinho over a decade ago, and winning the title each time. Their next two games are against Liverpool and Arsenal, who both beat Chelsea in the autumn.\n\nEmerge unscathed from those contests and it is hard to see anyone overhauling them over the campaign’s final three months, despite Conte’s insistence this division is capable of conjuring an upset. A weekend littered with unexpected results proved that much but Chelsea, bolstered by Costa’s contribution, merely watched others stumble.

Swansea City belied their league position, their form and their history here to rise off the foot of the Premier League with an accomplished display that reverberated all the way to the top.\n\nA cold, flat and goalless first half gave way to a remarkable second when Fernando Llorente gave Paul Clement’s team a two-goal lead only for Roberto Firmino to lead a comeback and level matters. Liverpool sensed another statement victory in their pursuit of the title but another defensive lapse enabled Gylfi Sigurdsson to seal Swansea’s first league win here. A first home league defeat for more than a year left Klopp and his players feeling bad and the hangover will be even worse should Chelsea open up a 10-point gap with victory over Hull City on Sunday.\n\nKlopp claimed Clement had instigated the fastest improvement in a relegation-threatened team he had ever seen despite last Sunday’s 4-0 reverse against Arsenal. It proved to be no exaggeration. “The mindset in the group is that anything is possible,” said his Swansea counterpart.\n\n“Our main objective is not to look at the table or talk about how many wins or points we need but to just focus on delivering some performances. Against Arsenal we delivered a 35-minute performance. We suffered two big blows that put us on the back foot, two own goals that were very unlucky, but today we gave a 90-minute performance. We defended well, we took our opportunities at set-pieces and were dangerous on the counterattack.”\n\nKlopp lamented Liverpool’s failure to take a first-half lead but not the merits of Swansea’s victory. Maybe it was the early kick-off or the freezing temperatures but the hosts were subdued until falling two goals behind. Philippe Coutinho initially offered his customary range of inspired passing on his first home appearance since damaging ankle ligaments in November but even he was running the ball out of play by the end of an unusually slow, cumbersome opening by Liverpool’s standards.\n\nEmre Can and Adam Lallana squandered decent openings before the break while Swansea almost profited from their first attack, with new signing Tom Carroll striking a post via a deflection off Dejan Lovren. Carroll and Martin Olsson impressed on their Swansea debuts having arrived at the club in midweek.\n\nLiverpool came out early for the second half but did not switch on. Lovren needlessly conceded a corner with a miscued header and from Sigurdsson’s delivery Liverpool lost every subsequent challenge. Federico Fernández beat Ragnar Klavan and Lovren in the air to head goalwards. The ball rolled off Llorente’s shins on to Wayne Routledge with his back to goal and after he controlled the centre-forward stabbed the loose ball beyond Simon Mignolet from close range.\n\n“Llorente is completely alone in our six-yard box,” said Klopp. “It should not be difficult to miss him.”\n\nHis side were two goals in arrears before they could rouse themselves. Swansea’s new signings were at the heart of an outstanding strike as Olsson broke and released Carroll down the left. The midfielder swept a perfect first-time cross towards the penalty spot and there was Llorente, towering above three defenders, to steer a textbook header beyond Mignolet’s grasp. Swansea were in dreamland, only now the hosts awoke from their slumbers.\n\nThe visitors had the cushion of a two-goal lead for three minutes before Firmino converted a convincing header of his own. Jordan Henderson sprayed a cross-field ball to James Milner on the left and he returned a deep cross towards the Brazilian who, with Olsson failing to clear, beat Lukasz Fabianski with an unstoppable header. Olsson claimed he was nudged in the back by Firmino and may have had a point, but the referee, Kevin Friend, was unmoved.\n\nClockwatch: Crystal Palace v Everton, Real Madrid v Málaga – live! Read more\n\nLiverpool, team and crowd, were finally stirred and they clawed back the deficit courtesy of a sublime finish from the Brazil international. Georginio Wijnaldum created the equaliser with a fine piece of control to kill Milner’s high ball and cross from the left but it was all about Firmino. Two defenders were in close attention yet powerless to prevent the forward taking the ball on his chest and sweeping a first-time finish inside Fabianski’s right post.\n\nThe stage was set for the home side to complete the fightback. Time, momentum and Swansea’s understandable nervousness was on Liverpool’s side but so, too, was weak defending and it was the visitors who struck for a third time. Leroy Fer and Llorente combined for Carroll to attack the Liverpool rearguard. He evaded two nondescript challenges and over-ran the ball into the path of Klavan, who could only divert it across the penalty area towards Sigurdsson. The Iceland international made no mistake as he sent the ball back across Mignolet’s goal.\n\nLiverpool fought back, Lallana striking the bar and wasting the rebound, but to no avail.\n\nKlopp insisted damaging was too harsh a word to describe the impact of this result on his team’s title chances.

We saw it again today, we lose some points for mistakes – we pay the highest price.”\n\nMistakes were the order of the day with Bournemouth, who were still smarting from back-to-back defeats by Millwall and Hull, conceding twice from set-pieces and Watford falling asleep for both home goals. José Holebas’s 24th-minute corner was inadvertently flicked on by the Cherries defender Steve Cook to Miguel Britos, who nodded the ball back across goal for Kabasele to head home.\n\nBournemouth grabbed their equaliser three minutes after half-time when Watford lost concentration at a throw-in.

The striker darted into a Kabasele-sized gap in the visitors’ defence, gathered Andrew Surman’s pass and fired across the Brazilian goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes, who had needed a fitness test on a back injury before kick-off, to salvage a thrilling point.\n\nMazzarri was not impressed with Kabasele’s role in the goal. “He’s a very young player but he didn’t think about it,” added the Italian. “He had cramps, he could have told me before and we could have done better, but I’m not happy with that situation.”\n\nOn the plus side for Bournemouth, at least they did not concede three as they had done in their previous six matches. But that minor improvement did not cut much ice with their manager, Eddie Howe.\n\n“Was it frustrating? You could say that,” he said. “I thought we defended well in open play. We knew set plays would be a strength for them, they are a really big team, but the manner of the two set-plays is disappointing.\n\n“But I thought it was a good performance.

time ensured the former England manager is still waiting for his first Premier League victory in charge of Crystal Palace.\n\nWayne Rooney breaks Manchester United scoring record with equaliser against Stoke City Read more\n\nHaving seen his three-man defence spend the majority of the game successfully repelling a revitalised Everton side, all the hard work was undone in a matter of moments after the wing-back Jeffrey Schlupp – making his debut after joining from Leicester – went down with cramp on the edge of the opposition’s penalty box. Allardyce attempted to make a substitution but was not permitted to by the referee, Anthony Taylor and, almost inevitably, Tom Davies made the most of Schlupp’s absence from his usual station to feed Coleman for the game’s decisive moment. To add insult to injury, replays showed that the Ireland international was offside.\n\nThat meant Allardyce’s side sank into the relegation zone for the fist time this season. “It was an easy one because it was right in front of him,” he said. “I don’t think we were really to blame. If Jeffrey had stayed on I don’t think Coleman would have got in that position.\n\n“We’re very disappointed – I would have been absolutely delighted with a goalless draw.”\n\nSwansea’s win at Liverpool in the early kick-off meant Palace had finally plunged into the bottom three after months of flirting on its fringes. Allardyce responded by handing a debut to Schlupp, while there was also a first Premier League start for Loic Remy since he joined on loan from Chelsea last summer.\n\nThey certainly began with more purpose with Remy looking dangerous playing off Christian Benteke and the Belgian was unlucky to see his header come back off the crossbar in the eighth minute. From then on, however, Everton assumed control, with Ross Barkley looking particularly dangerous from his advanced midfield role.\n\nThe Palace goalkeeper, Wayne Hennessey, did well to deny him, Kevin Mirallas and Ramiro Funes Mori with a flurry of saves in the first half but the visitors showed the confidence garnered from four wins in their past five matches, including last week’s 4-0 thumping of Manchester City. Ronald Koeman was dismissive of Palace’s complaints and felt the victory was deserved for his side, who now find themselves within touching distance of sixth place once more.\n\nWest Bromwich Albion’s Fletcher and Brunt send Sunderland bottom Read more\n\n“He [Schlupp] was first out of the pitch and he brought himself on so I think the referee made the right decision,” said the Dutchman. “It’s not bad to score a late one because they did not have time to get a draw. I’m really proud of the win because the attitude was perfect.”\n\nFor his opposite number, there were at least some positives to be drawn. Conceding goals has been Palace’s major problem and they did look much more secure than during the last home defeat to Swansea this month. Yet Allardyce will be only too aware that they are in desperate need of a morale-booster and he was keen to stress that finding themselves in the bottom three need not be a disaster.\n\n“It doesn’t make any difference,” he said. “What you’ve got to do is win points and we need to start doing that quickly.”"}, {"date": "21/01/2017", "arena": "Riverside Stadium", "attendance": 30848, "home_team":

United’s mid-winter revival continued with a fifth win in seven league games.\n\nMuch more of this from Slaven Bilic’s side and the striking Dimitri Payet will seem both increasingly dispensable and an even bigger idiot than he already appeared.\n\nAs hard as Adama Traoré tried – and, illuminating the bleakest of Teesside afternoons Aitor Karanka’s winger played like a man auditioning for a role at Chelsea next season – Middlesbrough could not quite avoid a defeat that leaves them far too close to the bottom three for comfort.\n\nThey are now without a win in their last five games and, perhaps unwisely, their manager bizarrely took his frustration out on the home fans. “The atmosphere was awful,” said Karanka. “They demanded too much. I don’t know how many thousands of people were asking for long balls at the end but it’s a style we don’t know how to play and the team was broken on the pitch. I was really upset.\n\n“We have to improve but they need to understand where we were last season. They have small memories. These players deserve more respect. It’s something we have to fix – and while I’m here we won’t be playing long balls.”\n\nBilic was somewhat happier. “We were way the better side,” he said, before revealing Angelo Ogbonna had played his last game of the season and is due to undergo knee surgery. “And Andy Carroll gives you everything. He’s brilliant. He’s quality.”\n\nThe same has been said of Payet but West Ham’s manager acknowledged that the Frenchman’s downing of tools had bonded and galvanised his team-mates. “You lose something and you gain something,” he shrugged. “But it would be ridiculous for me to say we don’t miss him playing.”\n\nKaranka’s mood might have been different had Carroll not recovered from the whiplash he sustained in the course of scoring that acrobatic volley against Crystal Palace last week. Indeed, it did not take the centre-forward many minutes to prove a real pain in the Boro manager’s neck.\n\nHis opening goal was quintessential Carroll, involving him out-leaping both Calum Chambers and Ben Gibson before connecting with Manuel Lanzini’s corner and powering an unstoppable header past the helpless Victor Valdés and into the net.\n\nAt least Karanka had Traoré on his side and the winger’s amalgam of rapid acceleration and a clever, shoulder dropping trick destabilised Bilic’s defence to the point where Chambers was able to cross for Cristhian Stuani to side-foot a shot beyond Darren Randolph at the end of a glorious eight-man passing move that encapsulated Karanka’s vision.\n\nUnwilling to be upstaged, Carroll offered a swift riposte, pouncing on the rebound after Valdés could only parry Michail Antonio’s low shot from the edge of the area into his path. As Carroll extended his left boot to steer the ball into the net, Valdes must have rued his failure to push Antonio’s effort around the post.\n\nBilic wanted a penalty when George Friend went through the back of Sofiane Feghouli in the area and the sense of visiting grievance grew when Bernardo Espinosa’s nasty, cynical, foul caused Mark Noble to hobble off nursing an ankle injury. Badly missing Noble’s intelligence in midfield, West Ham lived dangerously for a while.\n\nRandolph did well to keep a Marten de Roon header out and only Stuani’s body and the bar came, rather fortuitously, between Aaron Cresswell and an own goal.\n\nYet although a tight groin forced Carroll off, his replacement, Jonathan Calleri, enjoyed the final word, the substitute’s stoppage-time shot deflecting in off Adam Clayton before gentle boos greeted the final whistle. “I wouldn’t say the atmosphere was awful,” said Bilic. “It was just that we played real good.”\n\nBournemouth keep on

Wayne Rooney broke Stoke’s hearts as he surpassed Sir Bobby Charlton’s all-time record for Manchester United, stepping up four minutes into stoppage time to plunder his 250th goal for the club. It was an excellent strike a historic moment for Rooney and a mighty relief for his team.\n\nAfter 90 minutes United looked on the brink of a defeat that would have ended their 16-game unbeaten run and hampered their hopes of climbing into the top four, let alone mounting an improbable title challenge. But Rooney left an indelible mark on the occasion by reaching a career tally for United that may never be matched.\n\nWayne Rooney: breaking Manchester United scoring record a huge honour Read more\n\nThe goal came from a free-kick wide on the left in what looked like a promising position for a cross. Instead, Rooney curled a wicked shot past the wall and into the far corner. It was a suitably fine way to set a new standard.\n\nIt also contrasted starkly with United’s finishing up to that point, which is why José Mourinho devoted much of his analysis to lamenting his team’s profligacy. They had bungled several chances to equalise before Rooney, a second-half substitute, seized the initiative and demonstrated true marksmanship.\n\nWhat made United’s misses all the more galling for Mourinho was that Stoke’s goal was scored inadvertently by Juan Mata, who deflected a cross by Erik Pieters past David de Gea in the 19th minute.\n\nMourinho was not blameless. His team’s sluggish attempt to respond to the stimulus provided before kick-off by Swansea’s surprising win at Liverpool was at least partially down to the manager’s flawed selection.\n\nStoke’s defence has been vulnerable to speed at times this season but Mourinho left Marcus Rashford on the bench and omitted Anthony Martial from the squad. He deployed Mata wide on the right and with Marouane Fellaini in central midfield the United lineup was one that made a priority of solidity over derring-do and, as such, was probably close to the one that Stoke would have selected if given the choice. The hosts were comfortable in the opening exchanges.\n\nUnited were not. In an intoxicatingly bilious atmosphere United initially seemed cowed. They were stodgy and blunt. Glenn Whelan and Charlie Adam are amongst the least mobile central midfielders in the Premier League but were enjoying parity, at least, with Paul Pogba, Ander Herrera and Fellaini.\n\nThe sight of Zlatan Ibrahimovic risked provoking flashbacks for Ryan Shawcross, whose England career was in effect ended by the Swede’s tormenting of him during a memorable friendly against Sweden in 2012 – but United were so short of creativity in the early stages here that Shawcross could ease himself into the game and he went on to perform stoutly.\n\nWayne Rooney: a patched-up survivor with an astonishing goals record Read more\n\nNeither side mustered a significant attack before Stoke took the lead. Marko Arnautovic found Joe Allen with a clever chest pass and then dashed down the left to receive the return before pulling the ball back to Pieters, who had made a burst into the box. Mata’s attempt to cut out the Dutchman’s cross ended in embarrassment.\n\nNow United had to wake up. Antonio Valencia livened up immediately and broke down the right before floating a nice cross over Shawcross’s head to Ibrahimovic at the back post. But Ibrahimovic’s chest control was fractionally awry, allowing Shawcross to recover and whack the ball to safety. United were soon to squander far better chances.\n\nPogba, inconspicuous in the first 20 minutes, helped the visitors to gradually take control of midfield. Fellaini got a weak header to a cross from Mata in the 28th minute but at least forced Lee Grant to make a save.\n\nThe goalkeeper had no chance of getting his hands to a shot by Mata three minutes later after running off his line to confront Ibrahimovic. That did not matter because after the Swede teed Mata up for a tap-in from eight yards, Mata lifted the ball over the unguarded goal. It was some goof, but a neat way to sum up a painful off-day for the Spaniard.\n\nHe was not the only United player with his sights misaligned. Henrikh Mkhitaryan skied one shot so far over the bar, after more good play by Valencia, that Stoke fans belted out a merry rendition of Swing Low, Sweet Chariot. Just before half-time their mocking tune changed to one of acclaim for Grant, who made a sharp reflex save to turn away a sweet volley by Pogba.\n\nMourinho replaced Fellaini with Rashford in the 55th minute. But Stoke’s resistance had hardened by then, the home team defending valiantly in the face of relentless pressure. Not until 15 minutes from time did United really prise Stoke’s defence open again. Rooney picked out Rashford with a cross from the right. The youngster attempted to guide a shot from the edge of the area into the top corner but curled it wide.\n\nIt was left to Rooney to show everyone else how it is should be done."}, {"date":

Sunderland to further their claim to be the best of the rest in the Premier League and leave David Moyes a step closer to relegation.\n\nThe Sunderland manager was in the unusual position of being the optimist in the room. He claimed his side had played well in the second half and pointed at the performance of the academy debutant, George Honeyman, as an encouraging sign.\n\nNo one was fooled, however: this game was over before half-time. Two volleyed goals from Darren Fletcher and Chris Brunt meant the home side could play within themselves for the second 45 minutes. As much as their manager would let them, anyway.\n\n“I thought first half we were really good,” Tony Pulis said. “When we got the switch of play early we were dangerous and we scored two wonderful goals. We’re very, very pleased. Sunderland got up against us in the second half but it was a great result for us.\n\n“Everybody’s come together a bit more and there’s a better feeling about the place. We look dangerous in possession and Ben [Foster] is pleased with the clean sheet.”\n\nGylfi Sigurdsson and Swansea stun Liverpool in five-goal thriller Read more\n\nAt the heart of everything the Baggies did was Matt Phillips. Playing on the right of the Albion attack and facing up against Patrick van Aanholt, the winger was not only quick and strong but composed and smart. Admittedly, Phillips managed to get in the way of Albion’s first clear chance as he inadvertently blocked Salomón Rondón’s close-range header after 28 minutes.\n\nSixty seconds later he made amends. His low shot forced Vito Mannone into a stretching save and a corner. Phillips ran over to take it and drifted the ball into the box. He found a West Brom head, then another and a third, before the ball came to Fletcher on the penalty spot. The captain took it on the chest, span and hit a right-foot volley into the top corner. It was a goal reminiscent of Bryan Robson, another Manchester United and West Brom midfielder.\n\nThat ruined Sunderland’s gameplan. Moyes had started with a back three to provide extra defensive cover after a bad run of results. He had also come to play football but now possession was dangerous; any mistake could release a West Brom counterattack and finish the game.\n\nSeven minutes after the opening goal that moment arrived when James Morrison nipped in to win the ball and spring it to Phillips. He spun, nutmegged John O’Shea and drove once again at goal. His cutback found Nacer Chadli, who smashed a shot against the bar from only six yards.\n\nOohs went up from the crowd but they were followed by aahs when, from the edge of the box. Brunt volleyed the ball fiercely back into the net.\n\nAndy Carroll’s double sinks Middlesbrough as West Ham climb table Read more\n\n“It was a tough afternoon,” Moyes said. “It was always going to be that way after conceding two poor goals. We played better in the second half; we tried to get forward, we passed the ball better. In Honeyman we had one of the best players on the pitch.\n\n“I’m not really in the position to make many changes right now. I went to three at the back after mistakes in recent games, we tried to cover it up, but ultimately the second goal came from that.\n\n“We’re not that far away. Maybe if we had three points more we might be where people expect us to be.”\n\nPulis was able to introduce his new £10m signing from Hull, Jake Livermore, in the second half. He also confirmed the departure of Saido Berahino to his old team Stoke City. “I wish Saido all the best,” he said.\n\n“He’s joined a very good club. What he’s got to do now is clear his head of all the nonsense that’s been swishing around it the last 18 months. If Stoke can get him to do that, they’ve got a very good player.”"}, {"date": "21/01/2017", "arena": "Etihad Stadium", "attendance": 54402, "home_team": {"name": "Manchester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Claudio Bravo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pablo Zabaleta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nicolás Otamendi", "yellows": [52], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aleksandar Kolarov", "yellows": [45], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gael Clichy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [84]}, {"name": "Yaya Touré", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Raheem Sterling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [82]}, {"name": "Kevin De Bruyne", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [54], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Silva", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Leroy Sané", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [49], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sergio Agüero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Vincent Kompany", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fernando", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nolito", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willy Caballero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fabian Delph", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Stones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [84], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gabriel Fernando de Jesus", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [82], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Tottenham Hotspur", "lineup": [{"name": "Hugo Lloris", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eric Dier", "yellows": [13], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Toby Alderweireld", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [65]}, {"name": "Kevin Wimmer", "yellows": [12], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Kyle Walker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Wanyama", "yellows": [87], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mousa Dembélé", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [78]}, {"name": "Danny Rose", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Eriksen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dele Alli", "yellows": [51], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [58], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Kane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Heung-Min Son", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [77], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michel Vorm", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kieran Trippier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Moussa Sissoko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [78], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Winks", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [65], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Davies", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cameron Carter-Vickers", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Amid all the late drama, perhaps the best place to start trying to sum up a chaotic match was the moment Gabriel Jesus supplied the first touch of his Manchester City career. The ball was in the net and the Brazilian was 40 yards into his victory run before one of the ball-boys was impertinent enough to point out the offside flag had gone up. The only word to sum it up was bedlam and, at that precise moment, Pep Guardiola was on his knees, arms reaching out to the skies.\n\nIt was the kind of pose Basil Fawlty struck that time his Austin 1100 was giving him trouble. That is what City can do to a manager and, on this occasion, it was easy to understand why Guardiola was filled with frustration. His team had been 2-0 ahead, playing with great authority and the opposition manager, Mauricio Pochettino, did not try to disguise it. “It’s true, Manchester City were better than us,” Pochettino said.\n\nThis, however, was also an occasion where we learned a little more about the durability of this Spurs side and the qualities that will be essential if they are to sustain their title challenge. By the end, Spurs were even threatening to make it seven straight top-division wins for the first time in half a century. Yet they rode their luck and, though Guardiola has made it a policy not to criticise referees, it was tested by the moment, with the score 2-1, when Raheem Sterling ran into the penalty area and Kyle Walker took emergency action, namely a shove in the back.\n\nManchester City 2-2 Tottenham Hotspur: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nMaybe the criticism that Sterling has received in the past for alleged diving dissuaded him from going down. Even so, the push was enough to put him off his shot. Walker admitted afterwards that it should have been a penalty, which would also have meant the formality of a red card. No action was taken and within a minute Spurs had worked the ball upfield to conjure up an equaliser from Son Heung-min, a half-time substitute.\n\nSpurs had certainly made life difficult for themselves after the two mistakes from Hugo Lloris early in the second half had enabled Leroy Sané and Kevin De Bruyne to score and the visitors, already deprived of Jan Vertonghen, also had to deal with a second-half injury for Toby Alderweireld, meaning Eric Dier and Victor Wanyama finished the game in the centre of defence. Yet even in the more difficult moments Spurs never looked like a team that lacked belief and, for all the praise Guardiola reserved for his players, it continues to be startling how easy it is to score against his team.\n\nSpurs had two efforts on target – a far-post header from Dele Alli and a right-foot shot from Son – and that takes Claudio Bravo’s sequence to 16 goals conceded from 24 shots. Bravo, in fairness, could not be blamed on this occasion but the crowd are filled with apprehension every time the ball is in his vicinity.\n\nJohn Stones had been dropped and there cannot have been many City supporters who did not feel a pang of anxiety when they saw Guardiola’s lineup and realised Yaya Touré – hardly a modern-day Claude Makelele – was their only cover in front of defence. City duly maintained their record of only four clean sheets all season, fewer than Bournemouth, Stoke City and Burnley, and the questions persist about the team’s structure.\n\nPep Guardiola blames bad finishing and not referee for Spurs’ draw Read more\n\nOn the one hand, there is plenty to admire about a manager who shoehorns Sané, De Bruyne, Sterling and David Silva into a side that already has Sergio Agüero in its most advanced position. On the other, there is the persistent sense that Guardiola cannot get the balance right between attack and defence. Agüero’s form is curious, too – he has not scored in any game against top-seven opponents this season.\n\nPochettino had started with Kevin Wimmer in a three-man central defence but the Austrian had a difficult first half, in the face of some concerted City pressure, and Spurs changed after the interval to a 4-2-3-1 system with Son on the left and Dele Alli moving into a central position behind Harry Kane.\n\nTo begin with, it made little difference. City had started the game with an urgency that made it difficult for their opponents to settle and Lloris had been rushed into a couple of kicking errors even before his game turned into a personal ordeal. It was rare to see the Spurs goalkeeper look so accident-prone and the only mitigation, perhaps, is that his mistake for Sané’s goal was still on his mind when he made an even worse error for De Bruyne to score City’s second.\n\nClaudio Bravo still in the spotlight despite clangers from Spurs’ Hugo Lloris | Paul Wilson Read more\n\nPochettino argued afterwards that the first one should have been disallowed because when Lloris rushed from his penalty area, in a botched attempt to head away a bouncing ball, the reason why Sané was left clear on goal was because it struck his hand. Five minutes later, Lloris went to gather Sterling’s cross inside his six-yard area and the ball squirted out, just where De Bruyne wanted it. Lloris had made several fine saves in the first half but these were poor errors for a goalkeeper of his distinction.\n\nThe game changed after Alli headed in Walker’s right-wing cross just before the hour and the equaliser was a reminder of Spurs at their best, featuring a lovely touch from Harry Kane before Son picked out the bottom corner of Bravo’s net.\n\nJesus, an 82nd-minute substitute, thought he had won it – but he was two yards offside and even the ball-boy seemed slightly embarrassed."}, {"date": "15/01/2017", "arena": "Goodison Park", "attendance": 39588, "home_team": {"name":

For Tom Davies, Ademola Lookman and those of a royal hue, it was undoubtedly true as Everton produced the finest display and result of the Koeman era. For Pep Guardiola, by contrast, this was a harrowing, humbling experience. Manchester City were dismantled and their revered manager left searching for answers to the heaviest league defeat of his glittering career.\n\nEverton teenager Tom Davies ensures Pep Guardiola knows his name | Paul Wilson Read more\n\nGuardiola conceded the Premier League title is beyond his expensively assembled side after enduring the club’s biggest defeat against Everton for 31 years. “You’re getting sacked in the morning,” reverberated around a jubilant Goodison Park as the home crowd revelled in an uncomfortable return for John Stones and the emerging talents of Mason Holgate, the new signing Lookman and the outstanding Davies in particular. The Evertonians were pushing it, of course, but the City manager has bigger problems than the rarity of ending a league campaign without the championship on the evidence of another feeble defensive performance.\n\nRomelu Lukaku opened the scoring with Everton’s first shot on target, a familiar story for City and one Guardiola admitted affected his players mentally, having started brightly. Kevin Mirallas struck a decisive blow moments after the restart and from that moment onwards the fortunes of Koeman and Guardiola, friends from their Barcelona days, veered in wildly different directions.\n\nEverton’s day rose to a crescendo as the 18-year-old Davies opened his account for the club with an exquisite finish that his uncle, the former title-winning striker Alan Whittle, would have been proud to call his own. Lookman, signed in an £11m deal from League One Charlton Athletic, then became the second teenager to score his first Everton goal – within four minutes of his Premier League debut.\n\n“Maybe that was the best in terms of it being a total team performance,” the Everton manager, Koeman, said. “How we played in the second half was really outstanding, really perfect. It might have been impossible to play at a higher level in every aspect of football.”\n\nThe worry for City was not only their limited reaction to falling two goals behind early in the second half but their manager’s admission that he “has to look for the best solution” to issues that have plagued his team for several months. Ten points adrift of the leaders Chelsea and languishing outside the Champions League places, City are toiling defensively while their manager insists a more clinical approach will alleviate inconsistencies and torment at the back. This was a defeat that also raised questions of theircharacter.\n\nGuardiola described City’s first-half display as “exceptional” and they did impress until Lukaku scored his 13th of the season in the 34th minute. Raheem Sterling screamed in vain for a penalty after colliding with Joel Robles’s trailing leg as he attempted to round the Everton goalkeeper and the covering Leighton Baines. The referee, Mark Clattenburg, was unmoved. That came from City’s first foray down their left and the first of several quality deliveries from Kevin De Bruyne, who created another clear opening for the former Liverpool winger and David Silva. Both were wasted, so, too, a two‑on-one counterattack involving Sterling and Pablo Zabaleta – deployed as a roving central midfielder in the absence of Fernandinho, Fernando and Ilkay Gündoğan. Their generosity was punished ruthlessly.\n\nThe breakthrough arrived when Gaël Clichy gifted possession to Davies. The teenager pierced City’s defence with a superb pass into Mirallas, who cut the ball back invitingly for Lukaku. His compatriot side-footed a precise, powerful shot inside Claudio Bravo’s left-hand post.\n\nRemarkably, it was the fourth time in the past seven league games that City had conceded the first shot on their goal. Guardiola had switched Stones, given a harsh reception, to the left of City’s central defence to combat Lukaku’s tendency to cut inside onto his favoured left foot. There was no City defender near the Belgium international when he converted and the tone for a feeble display at the back had been set.\n\nLukaku, who had carried Bradley Lowery – the five-year-old Sunderland fan diagnosed with neuroblastoma – on to the pitch before kick-off was involved in Everton’s second. His attempted through-ball was intercepted by Stones but the impressive Ross Barkley slipped the rebound into the path of Mirallas, who found Bravo’s far corner with an excellent finish – in keeping with the Belgian’s overall contribution.\n\nGuardiola introduced Kelechi Iheanacho for Zabaleta in an attempt to cajole a fightback but City’s response barely flickered into life. Everton’s day simply got better and better.\n\nPep Guardiola rules Manchester City out of title race after Everton thrashing Read more\n\nDavies, who had cleared a Clichy header off his own goal-line in the first half, put the contest beyond the visitors with a goal that encapsulated the many qualities he has shown since joining the senior ranks. First, he outmanoeuvred Yaya Touré and Clichy with a determined run down the right before playing the ball inside to Lukaku. Barkley took over, spotted that Davies had continued his run and released the teenager on the right of the penalty area. Davies clipped a delightful finish over the advancing Bravo and beyond Lukaku’s attempt to apply the final touch on the line.\n\nKoeman brought on the £20m signing Morgan Schneiderlin and, so comfortable were Everton, January’s other recruit, the 19-year-old Lookman. The forward had been on the pitch less than four minutes when Séamus Coleman’s raid broke to him inside the area and, ignoring the right-back’s call for a return pass, he fired a low finish through the legs of the City goalkeeper.

There used to be a similar one here in honour of Manchester City but it went a few years ago and, for a while, this had looked like being another day when the team from Anfield could also imagine removing those kind of indignities.\n\nTheir frustration at not being able to hold on to their half-time lead could be gauged by the exchange late on when Jürgen Klopp, looking close to the point of spontaneous combustion, argued with José Mourinho by the pitch and did not seem too enthusiastic about the prospect of making friends.\n\nAll the great championship-winning sides from Anfield knew how to hang on to 1-0 leads, and if the modern version had managed it here they would have been the first Liverpool team in the Premier League era to take 47 points from 21 games. To surrender that chance with only six minutes of normal time to go must have stung.\n\nManchester United v Liverpool: Premier League - as it happened Read more\n\nInstead the opportunity to move directly behind Chelsea at the top of the table was lost – courtesy of Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s 19th goal of the season – on another of those days when Marouane Fellaini was summoned from the Manchester United substitutes’ bench in the hope that a gangly six-footer with sharp elbows and a peculiar relationship with the club’s supporters might be able to save them.\n\nFellaini flicked a header against the post to create the panic from which Ibrahimovic scored, and Mourinho talked afterwards about having a “problem in my neck” because he had spent so long in the second half looking in one direction – namely the way United were attacking.\n\nTo be fair, that was the summit of Mourinho’s exaggeration and he also made it clear he was dissatisfied with his team’s general carelessness.\n\nIt was a strangely erratic display from the home team and Paul Pogba chose a bad day to have one of his least distinguished performances, most notable for the first-half incident when he tried to clear a corner from his own penalty area in the manner of a basketball player going for a slam-dunk. A simple header would have sufficed and when James Milner converted the penalty Liverpool defended with great togetherness while frequently looking dangerous on the break.\n\nKlopp felt Liverpool had been the better side for 70 minutes “until they came with the long ball”, noting the way Fellaini’s introduction changed the complexion of the game and blowing out his cheeks about “all the balls bouncing around the 18-yard box”.\n\nHis mood was not helped when he was informed that Antonio Valencia was offside in the buildup before the decisive cross for Ibrahimovic. Though the Liverpool manager did not say as much, he might also reflect that his side can make better use of the ball, too. Mourinho felt both sides were conspicuously below their best – even if the two teams did give absolutely everything.\n\nPogba was the case in point bearing in mind his collection of individual errors was not merely restricted to the moment he lost his bearings inside the penalty area, realised he might have lost his opponent, Dejan Lovren, and threw out his arms to try to rectify the situation.\n\nThat was not the only time Pogba seemed disorientated at Liverpool’s set pieces and he will not feel any better that, with the game goalless, he wasted his team’s first clear opportunity, running on to Henrikh Mkhitaryan’s through ball before aiming a hesitant left-foot shot wide.\n\nPogba might also have cost United another goal in the second half, losing the ball and spared only because Georginio Wijanldum headed over a right-wing cross from Emre Can, the game’s outstanding performer. These are not the moments expected of a player signed for a world-record fee but, if nothing else, Pogba kept going. The same applied to United as a whole – they could have passed the ball with much greater authority but nobody could ever doubt their commitment.\n\nLiverpool had Trent Alexander-Arnold, an 18-year-old, starting his first Premier League fixture in place of the injured Nathaniel Clyne, and it cannot have been an easy adjustment when for long spells the game seemed to be played at ice-hockey speed.\n\nLiverpool forced to withdraw Joël Matip from Manchester United fixture by Fifa Read more\n\nIt was breathless stuff and perhaps it was just inevitable that a game played with this kind of intensity would have error-strewn periods. However much Pogba is criticised, it will not have escaped Mourinho’s attention that Phil Jones was dispossessed by Roberto Firmino to give away the corner that led to the penalty.\n\nIbrahimovic tested Simon Mignolet with a cannonball of a free-kick before half-time and Liverpool’s goalkeeper also denied Mkhitaryan after Ander Herrera had given the Armenian a chance to equalise.\n\nThere was no doubting United’s endeavour but they lacked finesse and Klopp could think back to Wijnaldum’s header and another chance, at 1-0, for Firmino as he reflected on a draw that means Liverpool have not won any of their opening four matches in a calendar year for the first time since 1993."}, {"date": "14/01/2017", "arena": "White Hart Lane", "attendance": 31613, "home_team": {"name": "Tottenham

title does not sound too fanciful.\n\nWest Bromwich Albion have come to be bogey opponents and their reputation for being a tough nut to crack under Tony Pulis has long been established. Spurs simply blew them away during the opening 45 minutes, which was as one-sided a half of football as will have been seen for some time, before they finished the job in the second period.\n\nHarry Kane helped himself to a hat-trick, which was a lovely way for him to celebrate the birth of his first child, Ivy, last weekend, but he could have had many more, while once again Christian Eriksen excelled and Dele Alli was not too far behind in the ratings.\n\nTottenham Hotspur 4-0 West Bromwich Albion: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nFor now Tottenham are up into second place – on the back of six straight league wins – and they have hit top form at the same time as they did last season, when they seriously challenged for the title. Pochettino’s three-at-the-back system looked perfectly calibrated and the only disappointment was a serious ankle-ligament injury for Jan Vertonghen. The message from the home support rang around White Hart Lane. The leaders, Chelsea, ought to watch their backs.\n\nWest Brom had come to be compact, with a tight midfield trio plus wide midfielders who were so deep at the outset that the formation looked more like a 6-3-1. Tottenham laid waste the plan and Kane might have had his hat-trick inside the opening 25 minutes. In the first half alone he had five clear sightings of goal and the visitors could be thankful that Ben Foster’s reflexes were on point.\n\nThe one that Kane did score before the break was a precision finish but it was underpinned by shoddy West Brom defending that felt so uncharacteristic for a Pulis team. Eriksen collected the ball from Victor Wanyama and he clipped a simple pass through for Kane, who was played onside by the dawdling Craig Dawson. Kane took one touch before lifting the ball over Foster into the near top corner.\n\nAs is so often the case with early kick-offs, the atmosphere was subdued for long periods. The home crowd merely settled back to be entertained. They were. Alli pushed up alongside Kane while the imperious Eriksen floated between making a third man in central midfield and getting forward. Pochettino said it looked as though his team had used “100 different systems”.\n\nThree of Kane’s first-half chances were from close-range but he guided the first from Danny Rose’s cross past the far post while Foster saved the other two. Kane also saw the Albion keeper tip his low shot from outside the penalty area on to a post and away in the 35th minute.\n\nMauricio Pochettino says Tottenham are ready to challenge for title Read more\n\nTottenham’s second goal in the 26th minute was marked by good fortune but nobody could say that Eriksen did not deserve it. He took a shot from the edge of the area and it deflected first off Jonas Olsson and then Gareth McAuley to wrong-foot Foster. The stadium announcer called it as a McAuley own goal. Alli had the ball in the net again moments later, from Eriksen’s lovely return ball only to be called back for a narrow offside.\n\nThe travelling Albion fans were treated to a half-chance shortly after half-time, when Salomón Rondón ran through and dragged a shot wide of the far post, while Pulis made a tactical switch on 54 minutes when he sent on James McClean and went to a 3-5-2 formation. Matt Phillips and McClean were the wing-backs. It was Pulis’s way of trying to combat Tottenham’s Kyle Walker and Rose – which is a preoccupation for every opposing manager these days.\n\nAlbion were better in the second half but Spurs still carved out chances and Foster further enhanced his status as the only visiting player to emerge with any credit. He made a double save from Toby Alderweireld and Vertonghen following a corner while, after Alli had nutmegged Darren Fletcher and fed Kane, Foster beat out the striker’s shot. He also denied Wanyama after further prompting from Eriksen.\n\nThe loss of Vertonghen was a grisly moment. He rolled his ankle as he chased a ball into touch on 64 minutes and when he was helped off, he covered his eyes with his hands. The distress was obvious and it is already plain that he faces a lengthy layoff. Pochettino said that the prognosis would be clearer on Monday.\n\nTottenham turned the screw in the closing stages and Kane’s second was a moment to forget for McAuley, who dithered as Walker chased Alli’s pass up the line and was robbed by the wing-back, who crossed. Kane finished with a side-on shot, while he completed the hat-trick with eight minutes to go with a volleyed finish from Alli’s scooped ball over the top.

From around 25 yards, Barton deceived the Saints goalkeeper, Fraser Forster, planting the set piece low, around the wall and into the net.\n\nAsked what such a colourful character is like as a substitute, Dyche said, joking: “He said, ‘What do I do?’ He was confused by being sub. He said, ‘Do I take my boots out with me? Wear a T-shirt or wear a warm-up top or what?’ I said, ‘Oi, you, get on with it!’”\n\nBarton has struggled to find a home at several clubs throughout his career but at Burnley he has a manager who understands him and a fan base who adore him, despite his exit last summer.\n\nIn a dull contest lacking attacking spark, it had to be Barton who claimed the winner, even if his effort may have gone in via a slight deflection.\n\n“You can’t make it up,” Dyche said. “I just said to him, ‘I couldn’t write your story’. Sublime finish – of course, he’ll be telling everyone that anyway. We probably earned a scratch of luck.\n\n“He’s experienced. There’s a manliness to the way he goes about his performance and there’s an assuredness from many years of playing top-level football.\n\n“For all that he gets a bit of stick, he’s so used to that. He brushes it off and gets on with it and focuses on his football. I felt it was appropriate for him to come back in to us. I’ve had no question about him before and I didn’t see why I would again. So far, he’s slotted in nicely again.”\n\nBurnley’s Andre Gray: ‘I was just relieved I hadn’t been stabbed in the eye’ Read more\n\nAfter beating Liverpool in the first leg of their EFL Cup semi-final in midweek, Southampton slipped to a fourth successive league defeat. Their problems were clear as they failed to add to their total of 19 league goals. Only Middlesbrough have scored fewer.\n\nTheir 20th of the season might have arrived in the 58th minute had Nathan Redmond tried to convert Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg’s left-wing cross with his left foot rather than tamely side-footing into the ground with his right from 15 yards out\n\nSouthampton had spent much of the first half on top, with Dusan Tadic twice unable to convert openings and James Ward-Prowse’s header was beaten away by Tom Heaton after Shane Long had lost Ben Mee down the right.\n\nAfter the break, Ryan Bertrand and Virgil van Dijk were denied equalisers by Heaton, who then made a terrific double save to thwart Jay Rodriguez and Josh Sims.\n\n“It’s difficult to accept this loss,” said the Saints manager, Claude Puel. “It was just one free-kick, a strange free-kick to win this game. It’s a big disappointment.\n\n“Many games are the same – with quality, with a lot of chances. It’s important to be clinical and to be deserving all of this good work. It’s a big frustration and a big disappointment. It’s important to stop this scenario and to continue with the same spirit.”\n\nBurnley also confirmed that Chelsea have recalled the striker Patrick Bamford from his loan spell at the club."}, {"date": "14/01/2017", "arena": "KCOM Stadium", "attendance": 17963, "home_team": {"name": "Hull City", "lineup": [{"name": "Eldin Jakupovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Maguire", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Dawson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Curtis Davies", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adama Diomande", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Mason", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [86]}, {"name": "Tom Huddlestone", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Samuel Clucas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andrew Robertson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robert Snodgrass", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [76]}, {"name": "Abel Hernandez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [32, 50], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [83]}], "subs": [{"name": "Evandro", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [76], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Oumar Niasse", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [83], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jake Livermore", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [86], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Weir", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Marshall", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Josh Tymon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jarrod Bowen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Bournemouth", "lineup": [{"name": "Artur Boruc", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Smith", "yellows": [60], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steve Cook", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tyrone Mings", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [62], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charlie Daniels", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andrew Surman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Arter", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Junior Stanislas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [3], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [69]}, {"name": "Jack Wilshere", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Fraser", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [55]}, {"name": "Benik Afobe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [55]}], "subs": [{"name": "Dan Gosling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marc Pugh", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [69], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Callum Wilson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [55], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Brad Smith", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joshua King", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [55], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Federici", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordon Ibe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Perhaps the Marco Silva revolution is on. This was Hull City’s first league victory since early November and as the songs of ire against the club’s owners were exchanged for ones in support of their new manager, a great escape this season suddenly glimmers on the horizon.\n\nAbel Hernández scored twice in a comeback that caught Bournemouth completely off-guard, with Eddie Howe’s side having dominated the first half-hour and squandered numerous chances to put the game out of Hull’s grasp.\n\nChelsea bandwagon rolls on as Marcos Alonso double sees off Leicester Read more\n\nHowever, Hull demonstrated impressive character and, where Hernández is concerned, a killer instinct. This was the first league game the Uruguayan had started since City’s last league win, on 6 November, and it was no coincidence that Hull looked far more dangerous in attack.\n\nIn Silva’s first Premier League match there was much to be positive about. Junior Stanislas had given Bournemouth the lead with an early penalty but Hernández’s double and an own goal from Tyrone Mings move Hull to 18th, above Swansea and Sunderland.\n\nSilva said: “When I saw my team with the big speed we had during this game, the big attitude, I’m happy. It was important to win the game.\n\n“I saw many things different in our team. It was a good day for our fans and there was a fantastic atmosphere in the stadium. I said pre-match that we need them and they played with us.\n\n“It was my first game in the Premier League, in one week we play three games and we win two which is fantastic. In the last two months we didn’t win one game. I’m sure the players believe more, that they are starting to believe and understand better what I want for the team.”\n\nHowever, things could hardly have got off to a worse start. Barely two minutes had been played before Bournemouth were given a golden opportunity to go ahead from the penalty spot, after Harry Maguire tripped Ryan Fraser inside the box.\n\nIt was a clumsy challenge, and one that Martin Atkinson did not need to dwell on before penalising the defender. Stanislas smashed the resulting penalty past Eldin Jakupovic, scoring his seventh league goal of the season to go alongside his seven assists.\n\nBournemouth then enjoyed a period of concerted pressure during which they should have increased their advantage. Jack Wilshere had a shot charged down well by Curtis Davies on the edge of the area before Harry Arter curled an effort narrowly wide in the 15th minute.\n\nTheir best chance, though, came from some inept Hull defence. A long ball was punted forward and after Michael Dawson allowed it to bounce Benik Afobe raced in behind for a one-on-one with Jakupovic that the goalkeeper did extremely well to block.\n\nArsenal canter to easy win as Swansea concede two costly own goals Read more\n\nIt was all Bournemouth. Indeed, Hull did not register their first serious effort until the 31st minute when Robert Snodgrass shot speculatively over from 25 yards. It was the spark they needed to provide some attacking impetus and soon they were level.\n\nThe Hull full-back Andy Robertson received the ball in a deep position down the left and swung in a precise and inviting cross to the far post where Hernández headed home. The game then swung dramatically in Hull’s favour, Silva’s side pressing well until half-time.\n\nThey were rewarded five minutes into the second half. This time Hernández did all the hard work himself, receiving the ball down the right and jinking into the area, deceiving Mings before firing left-footed into Artur Boruc’s bottom-right corner.\n\nMings was the unfortunate man who sealed Bournemouth’s demise. Huddlestone unleashed a powerful shot from the right edge of the penalty area that took a significant deflection off the defender.\n\nHowe said: “We were dominant for the first half-hour, it was the perfect start for us. We were in control of the game but I don’t think we went for the throat of Hull. I felt we were content with one and then the flow of the game changed when they equalised. From that moment we never really got control back.”\n\nOn Hull’s survival chances, he added: “I don’t think it would be a miraculous escape, they’re in among it. There’s minimal difference between the mid-table teams, the bottom teams. Anything can change at this stage of the season.”"}, {"date": "14/01/2017", "arena": "Stadium of Light", "attendance": 42722, "home_team": {"name": "Sunderland", "lineup": [{"name": "Vito Mannone", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Donald Love", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John O'Shea", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Papy Djilobodji", "yellows": [62], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Patrick van Aanholt", "yellows": [72], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Rodwell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jason Denayer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fabio Borini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adnan Januzaj", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sebastian Larsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jermain Defoe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [40], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Billy Jones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Mika", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Javi Manquillo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joel Asoro", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Josh Maja", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "George Honeyman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Elliot Embleton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Stoke City", "lineup": [{"name": "Lee Grant", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Glen Johnson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Shawcross", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bruno Martins Indi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Erik Pieters", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Glenn Whelan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charlie Adam", "yellows": [56], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [68]}, {"name": "Xherdan Shaqiri", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [89]}, {"name": "Joe Allen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marko Arnautovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [15, 22], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Peter Crouch", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [34], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Phil Bardsley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marc Muniesa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ibrahim Afellay", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [68], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gianelli Imbula", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shay Given", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joel Taylor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Julien Ngoy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [89], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "As Jermain Defoe raised his eyes to the stands at the final whistle he was greeted by a sea of long since emptied seats. With the remaining Sunderland fans directing gentle boos and rather resigned shouts of “rubbish” towards the pitch, David Moyes’s star striker could have been forgiven for hankering after a return to West Ham before the end of the month.\n\nThis latest surrender was not remotely Defoe’s fault – indeed his goal, scored when Stoke were three up, provoked sufficient uncertainty among Mark Hughes’s defence to almost certainly spare the Wearsiders real humiliation – but the forward’s unusually downcast body language seemed indicative of a man losing faith in Sunderland’s ability to win their latest relegation fight.\n\nWest Ham forget troubles as Andy Carroll stars in win over Crystal Palace Read more\n\nMoyes said: “We made three poor mistakes for the goals and we never got going. The damage was done and we got severely punished.”\n\nSunderland were unbeaten in their previous 14 league games against Stoke here but, right from the start, Hughes’s players appeared minded to change that narrative, with Marko Arnautovic, Peter Crouch and Xherdan Shaqiri in particularly incisive mood. Accordingly, it was not long before Shaqiri’s long through pass found Arnautovic unattended on the left. Seizing this invitation, the Austrian unleashed a shot that Vito Mannone repelled with a leg, only for the rebound to return straight back to Arnautovic who lashed a stunning shot into the roof of the net.\n\nSunderland were in alarmingly slapdash mode, often conceding possession cheaply, and they were suitably punished as Arnautovic swiftly doubled Stoke’s advantage. That second goal began with some excellent one-touch stuff from the visitors, featuring deft one-twos between first Arnautovic and Shaqiri and then the Austrian and the excellent Crouch. It concluded with Arnautovic curling an assured left-foot shot beyond the advancing Mannone. “One of the better goals I’ve been involved in,” said an approving Hughes.\n\nHis side were thoroughly shaking the previous weekend’s FA Cup defeat against Wolves out of their system while subjecting Moyes – slumped in his dug-out seat with arms folded and expression impassively grim – to unrelenting misery.\n\nGoal No3 beckoned when Shaqiri’s vicious low shot from distance looked to have confounded Mannone but the Italian, shaky throughout, somehow fumbled the ball on to a post after it had squirmed beneath him. This proved merely a temporary reprieve as, shortly afterwards, Charlie Adam’s fine cross exposed negligent marking while creating a deserved goal for the unmarked Crouch who, with the panicking Mannone off his line, headed Stoke’s third.\n\nWith 11 minutes left before half-time hundreds of fans stood up and started streaming towards the exits. Undeterred by the sudden rash of empty red plastic seats, Defoe succeeded in altering the mood a little by scoring his 12th goal of the season.\n\nBurnley rewarded for Joey Barton gamble with win against Southampton Read more\n\nConnecting with Donald Love’s long ball, the former England forward found himself onside and one on one against Lee Grant. There was only one winner, Defoe’s subtly curving right-foot shot crashing in off a post – Moyes probably dares not even contemplate where he would be without a striker much coveted by Slaven Bilic.\n\nIf Defoe’s work was destined to be undone by Papy Djilobodji – subsequently fortunate to collect a yellow rather than a red card following a wince-inducing late challenge on Arnautovic – and his tendency to freeze in the face of Crouch’s advances, his side at least stemmed the second-half tide.\n\nYet although Grant repelled Fabio Borini’s shot and Jack Rodwell missed a good chance, this mini home renaissance was largely down to Stoke sitting deep and ceding possession as they saw the game out.\n\n“I’m very satisfied,” said Hughes. “The first 35 minutes was the best we’ve played away all season.

Kyle Naughton then followed suit, this time from Iwobi’s cross, and it summed up Swansea’s day when Routledge put the ball on a plate for Sánchez to volley home and complete the rout.\n\nSánchez has now scored or assisted 31 goals in his last 32 Premier League appearances and remains Arsenal’s most influential player by a distance, yet it was the Chile international’s actions off the pitch, rather than his contribution on it, that provided the main talking point afterwards.\n\n“I rested him for two weeks, gave him a little breather. I think he benefited from that. I gave him another rest for today, so he will benefit from that as well,” Wenger said, with a twinkle in his eye and a wry smile.\n\n“He’s hugely influential. When you look at the numbers, he’s been involved in so many goals. But I think, as well, we have players on the bench who are strikers who need competition, we were 4-0 up, he’s just come back from a good rest, [Mesut] Özil as well comes back from sickness, so it was a good opportunity not to be stupid.\n\n“All the players are frustrated when they come off, some show it, some not. I’m long enough in the job to know that. I just make the decision I feel is right, that’s it. He’s a good guy who gives a lot and who always wants to do well for the team. There’s no problem. Looking at the game tonight, that’s really minor, minor, minor.”\n\nWenger went on to offer some kind words about Swansea and suggested that they “still have the quality to get out of it”‚ yet Clement was honest enough to admit that this performance had reinforced his views about the amount of work the club needs to do in the transfer window. Two more new faces are on their way, with Tom Carroll set to join from Tottenham for £4.5m and Martin Olsson arriving from Norwich for £5m, and others are likely to follow before the end of the month.\n\nSwansea 0-4 Arsenal: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nThe one frustration for Clement here was that Mike Jones, the referee, booked Ki Sung-yeung for diving just before the interval rather than pointing to the penalty spot as Laurent Koscielny dangled a leg and the Swansea midfielder tumbled over. “When I spoke to Ki at half-time he said there was contact,” Clement said. “I got the opportunity to look back on it from all the different angles – obviously the referee doesn’t get that – and saw the reaction of Koscielny, and it’s a penalty”.\n\nGiroud had given Arsenal the lead seven minutes earlier, turning home from close range after Özil’s header, from Sánchez’s cross, bounced off Alfie Mawson and into his path.\n\nAlthough Cork was unlucky to deflect Iwobi’s shot over Fabianski early in the second half, Arsenal’s second goal had been coming amid a spell of sustained pressure. Naughton’s own goal ended any faint hopes of a Swansea comeback before Sánchez turned the screw with a fourth.

Sadly for Watford and their emotional crowd, the team on the field failed to do their part and the game ended in a very forgettable draw.\n\nBefore the match hundreds gathered by a memorial of bright yellow flowers and hundreds of equally bright shirts to pay respect to their former manager. With Taylor’s wife, Rita, and their two daughters in attendance, the teams entered the field to Taylor’s favourite song, Buddy Holly’s Raining in My Heart.\n\nThere was also a flash of red and yellow foils in the Rookery Stand that spelled out their love for Taylor. The big screens played footage from Taylor’s two spells in charge at the club and there were messages of condolence scrolling along the hoardings. Finally, there was that unstinting minute’s applause, rounded out with chants in praise of the man. “We love you Graham Taylor” was a consistent refrain. You could feel that love.\n\nIt was clear there was pressure on Watford to perform. Pressure that was already palpable thanks to Walter Mazzarri’s side having taken four points from their previous seven matches. They failed to rise to the challenge. In physical effort Watford hardly stinted but they were noticeably lacking in creativity and composure.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Some of the tributes to Graham Taylor outside Vicarage Road. Photograph: Richard Heathcote/Getty Images\n\nThis was all grist to the mill of Aitor Karanka, who changed the shape of his side to match the three at the back of his hosts, and was more than happy to settle for a point.\n\n“It was very emotional, for all of us,” said Mazzarri, still speaking through an Italian translator. “This was due to the passing of a great person who made the history of Watford.\n\n“When there was the minute of applause I was very emotional, more than what you might think. That minute made everyone come together and it was a special moment.\n\n“The first half we were less good and it could be due to that emotion. The second half we were much better and should have got the win.”\n\nKaranka agreed that Watford grew into the match even if neither side could claimed to have been dominant. “It was a good point,” he said. “I was looking at it in analysis and I thought that the best way to play against their shape is to play that way too.\n\n“Our shape was good, the commitment was good. We were better in first half but we knew the second half would be a different game. Watford are a really strong team, a really mature team, and the only thing that we could do in the second half was defend.”\n\nGraham Taylor obituary Read more\n\nBoro did have a goal ruled out in the first half, Cristhian Stuani adjudged offside after having poked Álvaro Negredo’s flick into the net. The same combination 10 minutes before half-time saw Stuani read his strike partner’s header but lift his shot on to the roof of the net from a difficult angle.\n\nAt half-time Luther Blissett came on to speak about Taylor, a man he called a father, recalling the glory years when promotion to the First Division was followed by European football and, in 1984, an FA Cup final. “I owe everything to Graham Taylor,” the former striker said. “We wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for him.”\n\nMazzarri said his own half-time team talk was largely tactical, but Watford did return for the second half with greater vigour. Within three minutes of the restart they should have claimed the lead they craved when José Holebas’s cross sailed over the Boro defence and found Christian Kabasele at the far post. The makeshift wing-back must not have anticipated the ball getting beyond his marker, George Friend, because, even though he was left in time and space, he could only prod a limp header wide.\n\nKaranka brought on Rudy Gestede for his debut and Mazzarri did the same for Tom Cleverley in the hope of shifting the balance. Gestede shot just over from range with 10 minutes remaining.\n\nCleverley came the closest to breaking the deadlock when his side-foot shot from a clever Deeney header came back off the post. The final whistle was greeted with a chorus of boos.\n\n“We missed a bit of luck,” said Mazzarri. “Not just the Cleverley chance but others. These are small details and they make a big difference.\n\n“In terms of the pressure I feel, I can tell you with a smile on my face it’s no more than I put on myself every day.”"}, {"date": "14/01/2017", "arena": "London Stadium", "attendance": 56984, "home_team": {"name": "West Ham United", "lineup": [{"name": "Darren Randolph", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Collins", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Winston Reid", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Angelo Ogbonna", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Michail Antonio", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [89]}, {"name": "Mark Noble", "yellows": [34], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pedro Obiang", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Cresswell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Manuel Lanzini", "yellows": [87], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [86], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [87]}, {"name": "Sofiane Feghouli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [68], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andy Carroll", "yellows": [42], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [79], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Adrián", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sam Byram", "yellows": [70], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Fletcher", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [89], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonathan Calleri", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Reece Oxford", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Domingos Quina", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Edimilson Fernandes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [87], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Crystal Palace", "lineup": [{"name": "Wayne Hennessey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Tomkins", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Scott Dann", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Damien Delaney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joel Ward", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James McArthur", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [70]}, {"name": "Joe Ledley", "yellows": [38], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [81]}, {"name": "Andros Townsend", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [70]}, {"name": "Yohan Cabaye", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jason Puncheon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Benteke", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Julian Speroni", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mathieu Flamini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Loïc Remy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [70], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chung-Yong Lee", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [70], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Zeki Fryers", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jeffrey Schlupp", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [81], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Kelly", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "The days are long gone when you could offer a penny for someone’s thoughts. In modern football you might need thousands, tens of thousands, millions even, of hard currency. Whatever amount, an insight into Dimitri Payet’s mindset as he learned of West Ham United’s efforts without him would be fascinating. After a half of turgid football that summed up all the difficulties you would imagine a team to have when shorn of a creative leader, a most valuable player, West Ham found enough inspirational verve to leave the pitch with deserved applause ringing in their ears. “It was a great day for us,” enthused Slaven Bilic.\n\nDimitri Payet will not be sold by West Ham in January, says David Sullivan Read more\n\nNever mind the old cliche about changing games, goals can also change moods, and the three that West Ham constructed to swat aside a lacklustre Crystal Palace felt loaded as morale-boosters. Andy Carroll’s acrobatic scissor-kick volley was a spectacle in itself, and, with it, West Ham began to feel very differently about themselves and their predicament.\n\nThere is a school of thought that, given the situation, they would do better without their bad egg, in that it would create a new spirit. It is early days to get carried away, but Bilic had abundant reasons to feel his team responded to a hard week superbly. “I can call it one of them that is more than three points. A magnificent result,” he said.\n\nWest Ham had been left reeling from the rift with Payet – with the maverick Frenchman excluded since airing his desire to leave the club – and the problem hung heavy in the wintry air. A less than complimentary version of his song did the rounds, suggesting very little sympathy on the part of supporters for his stance, although the general mood inside the stadium revealed more of a weary, resigned disappointment than outright anger. In the match programme, the joint chairman David Sullivan pulled no punches: “We will NOT sell Dimitri in the January transfer market.”\n\nBilic himself had nothing much to add, saying he would if and when there is a development. He did acknowledge that the situation played a part in “galvanising” the squad. “I told the players we can expect a bit more support and we don’t want to lose it. They wanted to show real commitment and willingness and effort to win the game.”\n\nThat took patience. Some nerves for two teams struggling for form played a part in the opening spell. Crystal Palace tested West Ham’s resolve and James Tomkins was aghast to see a stabbed effort from close range squeeze past the post. That was as good as it got for the away side, who crumbled once a tactically adjusted West Ham, shifting to a back four, roused themselves in the second half.\n\nCarroll was in the thick of everything, heading and shooting on sight. The supporting cast more than played their part too, with the enterprise of Sofiane Feghouli, the dash of Manuel Lanzini and the astute passing of Michail Antonio all making a difference. Credit to West Ham for their persistence in continuing to claw at the door until they finally scratched their way through.\n\nWhen the breakthrough came it triggered a special kind of relief – one born of the adversity that everyone in the ground was well aware of. Deliverance came with a well-worked move, instigated by Mark Noble’s chipped pass into Antonio’s path. He advanced and shifted play across for Feghouli to tap in. The Algerian was elated.\n\nArsenal canter to easy win as Swansea concede two costly own goals Read more\n\nCarroll then took all that positive emotion and sent it through the roof with a special strike. “He does it in training, although he is normally hitting the post,” Bilic grinned. “I am afraid he will get injured when he does it in training. It was a contender for goal of the season, more than a goal.”\n\nLanzini added extra sparkle with another sweet strike, latching on to Antonio’s third assist to gently dink the ball over Wayne Hennessey with finesse.\n\nSam Allardyce looked up at the scoreboard and declared himself “shocked” by what he saw. “I didn’t think it would be one of those where we would collapse, but we did,” he said. “It’s tough for us at the minute. I am still finding out about the players. They are making statements to me by the fact results are not good enough. We haven’t changed that round, which is disappointing for me. The capabilities of not losing are the most important thing to get out of trouble. Once we gifted them the first goal we lost our shape, lost our discipline, started making more mistakes. We have got to be more resilient. They all know they can play better than they do now.” He departed focusing on how he can “coach the ugly side of the game” to give his team a fighting chance.\n\nWest Ham have a turning point to build on.

They did so emphatically, even if Leicester’s resistance was feeble.\n\nChelsea’s winning streak had been brought to a shuddering end in their last league match by Tottenham Hotspur, who moved even closer to the leaders by mauling West Bromwich Albion in Saturday’s early game. Chelsea restored their lead at the top of the table by outclassing the flagging champions.\n\nWithout Costa Chelsea deployed Willian in a fluid front three, just as he had done on Boxing Day, when Chelsea were deprived of the striker by suspension but still proved too strong for Bournemouth, winning 3-0. Here, too, the relentless movement and mischief-making of the Brazilian, Pedro and Eden Hazard ensured they had a fearsome attack. Leicester were toothless. They, at least, need not worry about anyone bidding for their main striker, not with Jamie Vardy in this form.\n\nIn fairness to Leicester they were shorn of more players than Chelsea, with Riyad Mahrez, Islam Slimani and Daniel Amartey at the Africa Cup of Nations. But Nigeria’s failure to qualify for the tournament in Gabon meant that Ahmed Musa and Wilfred Ndidi were available here. Ndidi’s first league appearance since his £15m purchase from Genk provided a handy opportunity to compare him with N’Golo Kanté, the man who left a void in Leicester’s midfield when lured away by Chelsea’s riches after helping City win last season’s title.\n\nThe Frenchman was given a warm welcome back by Leicester fans, who used to refer him affectionately as “the Kanté twins” because his dynamism made him akin to two players. Claudio Ranieri sought to outnumber him here and counter Chelsea’s other threats by switching to a 3-5-2 formation, with Ndidi, Nampalys Mendy and Danny Drinkwater deployed in the middle. Ranieri later explained that the ploy had worked in the second half of the sides’ meeting at Stamford Bridge this season and insisted that it worked well here, too, even though the result was another 3-0 defeat.\n\nIn truth, Leicester rarely bothered Chelsea after the second minute, when Courtois had to make a smart save from Musa. Then Chelsea flexed their muscles and Leicester wilted.\n\nIn the sixth minute a cross from the right by Azpilicueta triggered chaos in Leicester’s three-man central defence, where Hazard summoned the poise to apply a telling touch. While all around him panicked, the Belgian tamed a loose ball and rolled it calmly to Alonso, who scored with an impeccable curling finish of which Costa would have been proud.\n\nDiego Costa dropped by Chelsea after row over huge offer from China Read more\n\nChelsea controlled proceedings after that. Leicester did not seem at ease with their new system, their discomfort exacerbated by the visitors’ slickness. Not until the 36th minute did the hosts so much as fluster the Chelsea defence again but no Leicester player was on hand to take advantage of a vicious cross by Vardy, which Courtois intercepted with difficulty.\n\nThat faint chance was Leicester’s clearest sight of an equaliser before the break. Ranieri decided against tinkering during the interval, seemingly confident that his side could creep back into the game so long as they did not let Chelsea go farther ahead. Six minutes into the second half that theory was binned. And Alonso’s stock soared even higher.\n\nAfter a foul by Christian Fuchs on Willian, the latter floated a free-kick into the Leicester box. Again the attempted clearance was flawed and when the ball broke to Alonso at the edge of the area, he trapped it with one touch before lashing it into the net, a deflection off Wes Morgan helping to confound Kasper Schmeichel.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Marcos Alonso, with the help of a deflection off Wes Morgan, scores the second Chelsea goal. Photograph: Tom Jenkins for the Observer\n\nThat was Ranieri’s cue to scrap his original plan and revert to a more familiar 4-4-2 formation, with Shinji Okazaki coming on for Robert Huth. But getting back into the game would entail subduing visitors who were starting to revel. Gary Cahill exemplified that in the 61st minute with an overhead kick at goal. Fuchs’s block foiled a splendid effort but no one could get in the way of a spectacular 18-yard volley by Alonso moments later that whizzed inches past the far post.\n\nChelsea gave themselves further cause for celebration with a third goal that resembled a party trick. In one movement at the edge of the area Pedro spun and back-heeled the ball to the overlapping Willian, who clipped it over Schmeichel and back into the path of Pedro, who nodded into the empty net."}, {"date": "04/01/2017", "arena": "White Hart Lane", "attendance": 31491, "home_team": {"name": "Tottenham Hotspur", "lineup": [{"name": "Hugo Lloris", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals":

their first league defeat since losing against Arsenal at the end of September, has nothing to do with it stopping them establishing a record in the Premier League era of 14 successive wins in a single season. It would have been a nice one to chalk up, but a team with their ambitions will be far more distressed about what it means for the league table and the confidence it might give Tottenham Hotspur, seven points back, to think they can still play a considerable part in the title race.\n\nDele Alli’s goals certainly ought to encourage Spurs on a night when their supporters endured opposition songs poking fun that they “won the league in black and white”, referring to the fact that the last time the team from White Hart Lane finished as champions was back in 1961. Alli scored one at the end of the first half and another early in the second period. Both were headers and the England international has managed two goals in each of his past three games.\n\nTottenham deliver statement of intent but derby revenge still tastes sweet | David Hytner Read more\n\nAlli is in the best scoring form of his life and his latest brace was the most important of the lot given its impact on the top four and the braking effect it had on the league leaders, arriving here with their chests puffed out after 13 wins in a row.\n\nIt still counts as a remarkable feat even if that will be little consolation as they reflect on a sapping night against one of the teams they find it particularly difficult to lose to. Chelsea have tended to have easily the better of these encounters: this was their fifth defeat out of 50 Premier League meetings. Yet Spurs, lest it be forgotten, were high on confidence on the back of their own productive run of form.\n\nThey have now won five successive league fixtures. Their prize is to go third and push Arsenal down to fifth, and Mauricio Pochettino can reflect on a hugely satisfying evening’s work bearing in mind his switch to a 3-4-2-1 formation, deliberately set up to nullify Chelsea’s wing-back system.\n\nFrom Chelsea’s perspective, perhaps the most disappointing aspect of the performance was that as soon as Alli scored his second, nine minutes after the break, the home team were rarely endangered. Until that point, nobody could doubt Chelsea’s effort or that, at 1-0 down, this was a side that seemed mortally offended by the idea of losing.\n\nAfter that, however, there was not a great deal of personality from the team in blue and the home supporters could bask in one of those nights, under the floodlights, when it felt like a tremendous pity White Hart Lane, as we know it, is being lost to the bulldozers.\n\nTottenham Hotspur 2-0 Chelsea: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nIt was strangely meek from Chelsea given there was still time to save themselves and it was out of character, too, given there were other parts of the match when it was clear to see the competitive qualities that had helped them reach the league’s summit.\n\nAt one point in the first half Diego Costa seemed to forget he was supposed to be irritating the opposition defenders and turned on Pedro for not being on the same wavelength to receive a pass inside the penalty area. The two players were still chuntering away at one another the next time play stopped. It never looks good when two team-mates are arguing on the pitch but those were the moments when we could be absolutely certain how much this contest mattered to Chelsea.\n\nArsenal’s record lives on – how Arsène Wenger’s boys of 2002 made history Read more\n\nEqually, Costa did not do an awful lot in the last 35 minutes when his team really needed some extra inspiration and after an encouraging start to the second half their performance was perhaps epitomised by the moment, at 1-0, when Eden Hazard had a headed opportunity to equaliser. Hazard, for all his gifts, is not a natural in those positions but this was a particularly tentative effort, almost as if he was frightened of getting bashed in the process.\n\nIt was a spiky, absorbing contest, simmering with occasional tensions and passing reminders about the sporting enmity and lingering bad feeling from that wild and infamous encounter at Stamford Bridge last May. Alli will dominate the headlines but Victor Wanyama was the outstanding performer. Harry Kane found it difficult to get away from Gary Cahill but Alli now has seven goals in his past four games.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Dele Alli heads Tottenham into the lead on the stroke of half-time. Photograph: Tottenham Hotspur FC via Getty Images\n\nThe strange thing about the latest two was their similarity. On both occasions it was the same three players linking up – first Kyle Walker, then Christian Eriksen and, finally, Alli. Walker’s determination to push forward had brought defenders towards him. Eriksen was in a better position to clip the ball into the penalty area and when Walker turned a short pass back the Dane picked out Alli with the right‑sided delivery. To complete the sense of deja vu, Alli had found space in between César Azpilicueta and Victor Moses on both occasions, scoring with two precise headers.\n\nChelsea might reflect the game could have taken an entirely different course if Hazard had done better with the chance that came his way, four minutes in, but that was their only clear opportunity of the opening half and, apart from a brief flurry early on, there was not a great deal else to trouble Hugo Lloris after the break.\n\nSpurs were seldom threatened once Alli’s second header went in and they will miss these loud, triumphant nights when this stadium changes forever."}, {"date": "03/01/2017", "arena": "Vitality Stadium", "attendance": 11202, "home_team": {"name": "Bournemouth", "lineup": [{"name": "Artur Boruc", "yellows":

talk about Olivier Giroud’s scorpion kick – the real sting in the tail was delivered by the Frenchman 48 hours later as he scored an injury-time header that was nothing like as spectacular as his goal against Crystal Palace but every bit as important as Arsenal staged a remarkable comeback.\n\nWith little more than 20 minutes remaining Arsenal were staring at the prospect of a chastening defeat after Bournemouth had run the visitors’ defence ragged. Eddie Howe’s team were 3-0 up, the travelling Arsenal supporters had turned on their own team and it was hard to see a way back for Arsène Wenger’s players.\n\nLaurent Koscielny had departed with cramp, Héctor Bellerín was enduring what must go down as one of the most difficult nights of his career and there was no hint of a recovery. Yet in the 70th minute Alexis Sánchez headed in at the far post and, as Howe would ruefully later reflect, that was the key moment in this helter-skelter match.\n\nArsenal gained some belief and the balance of the game shifted – not just because of Sánchez’s goal. Ryan Fraser, who scored Bournemouth’s third goal and won the penalty that led to Callum Wilson converting from the spot earlier in the match, had been forced off through injury, meaning that the home team no longer had that lightning quick outlet on the left to stretch Arsenal.\n\nIt became a question of whether Bournemouth could hold their nerve and keep Arsenal at bay for long enough, yet within five minutes Wenger’s side had a second when Lucas Pérez volleyed beautifully into the far corner of the net. Incredibly Bournemouth came close to scoring a fourth but Dan Gosling curled wide and the significance of that miss soon became clear.\n\nWith eight minutes left, Simon Francis went into a full-blooded challenge with Aaron Ramsey that Michael Oliver, the referee, deemed worthy of a straight red. It seemed a little harsh and left Bournemouth, who were retreating deeper and deeper, desperately hanging on.\n\nThe game had ticked into the 92nd minute when Granit Xhaka delivered a cross that Giroud, towering above Steve Cook, headed beyond Artur Boruc. Arsenal had somehow rescued the most unlikely point, breaking Bournemouth hearts in the process. The home changing room, Howe admitted, was a desperately quiet place after the match.\n\nArsenal, in fairness, deserve credit for turning the game around, especially in light of the fact that this was their second fixture in the space of two days. It was not as if Wenger made wholesale changes – he retained eight of the side that started against Palace – and it says something about their character and resilience that they never gave up. Yet defensively Arsenal were all over the place at the times and it was alarming to see how easily Bournemouth exposed their weaknesses at the back.\n\nArsenal’s start was about as bad as it gets and Wenger was soon wearing that familiar pained expression on his face. His side conceded twice in the opening 20 minutes, Francis Coquelin limped off before the half-hour mark and, in another sign that everything was unravelling for Arsenal, Sánchez and Ramsey were raging at one another.\n\nBournemouth, on the other hand, were enjoying themselves and reaping the rewards of Howe’s bold tactics. Despite being without Benik Afobe, who was unable to play because Democratic Republic of Congo had not provided international clearance in the wake of the striker’s decision to withdraw from their Africa Cup of Nations squad, Howe still went with two up front. Wilson and Joshua King filled those positions and troubled Arsenal time and again with their pace in behind.\n\nYet it was Charlie Daniels, the Bournemouth left-back, who opened the scoring with a superbly taken goal. Running into the space that opened up behind Bellerín, Daniels controlled Junior Stanislas’s crossfield pass, stepped inside the Arsenal right-back and beat Petr Cech at his near post. Four minutes later Wilson scored from the spot after Xhaka pushed Fraser over in the area as the Scot scampered clear. Wenger felt that it was a soft penalty but Xhaka was playing with fire when he placed his left hand on Fraser’s back.\n\nIt seemed inevitable there would be an Arsenal response after the restart and so it proved for a period, yet it was Bournemouth who struck again. Daniels slid a pass into the inside left channel and Bellerin, who is no slouch, had a headstart on Fraser. Yet Fraser not only caught up with the Arsenal defender but was too strong for him.

Before stepping aside for the new manager, Paul Clement, he did his club proud once again as he steered them to victory against Crystal Palace.\n\nCurtis’s last match as the caretaker-manager brought a performance that belied Swansea’s position and their recent wretched form. Joined by Clement in the dugout for the second half, he also made two decisive substitutions to win the game when Àngel Rangel converted Leroy Fer’s long ball with two minutes left. It was a vital three points and confirmed Sam Allardyce has another big job on his hands at Palace.\n\nSwansea job excites Paul Clement: ‘It’s a big task but I think it can be done’ Read more\n\n“You’ll have to excuse the voice, a bit of excitement at the end there,” said Curtis before confirming it was he who had called the shots in the game’s final knockings. “I made the substitutes. There were injuries and players who had been suffering so the changes all sort of fell into place to be fair. Paul came down, he made a real positive contribution. There’s nothing better for any player than having a new manager watching them.”\n\nThe home side were being watched by a febrile crowd, with the mood in Selhurst Park worse than in the last days of Alan Pardew’s regime. Whether the atmosphere fed into Palace’s play or not, nerves were already manifest and the home side started terribly.\n\nSwansea had a focus about their approach and confidence on the ball. Palace were either overplaying or short of ideas. Allardyce put this down to fatigue after he chose to select a largely similar side to the one who lost to Arsenal two days previously. He also accepted his players had not performed well enough but saved his strongest words for the referee, Paul Tierney, after he failed to give Palace a penalty in the 32nd minute.\n\nA Wayne Hennessey goal-kick had somehow managed to clear the entire Swansea defence and fell to Christian Benteke who got a touch beyond the onrushing Lukasz Fabianski. The Belgian then went over the keeper and went to ground. Tierney saw no foul and video replays were not conclusive but Allardyce was incensed with the decision.\n\n“The goalie’s cleaned him out,” Allardyce said. “I can’t understand why the ref didn’t give the penalty but maybe I can because he has had very few games in the Premier League and might find it hard to make the big judgments. He got it wrong and he got it massively wrong. If we’d have scored that penalty I don’t think we would have lost that game.”\n\nSwansea took the lead just before half-time with a set piece Big Sam would have been proud of. It came from a typically expert delivery from Gylfi Sigurdsson, which was matched by the run from Alfie Mawson. The 22-year-old centre-half, signed from Barnsley in the summer, ran across the Palace line to flick the ball back from where he had come and inside the near post. It was his first goal for the club.\n\nThe crowd booed Palace off vociferously at half-time and then cheered them vigorously back on. Allardyce withdrew Benteke, who had hurt his shoulder falling over, and replaced him with Fraizer Campbell. He also added Bakary Sako for Andros Townsend and suddenly Palace had more zip, even if they struggled to create good chances.\n\nIn the 78th minute Sako provoked another penalty shout, bustling his way into the box and flicking the ball past Rangel only for the Spaniard to stop it with his hand. This one was a definite penalty but Tierney could not have seen it because his whistle stayed silent.\n\nOlivier Giroud caps Arsenal’s fightback to earn point in Bournemouth thriller Read more\n\nFor a moment it looked as if Palace had burned themselves out. Swansea were recovering their composure. But then in the 84th minute a moment of quality from Wilfried Zaha brought the scores level. Campbell chased down a long ball and played it wide to Martin Kelly. His first-time cross span across the edge of the box, where Zaha met it with a flying scissor kick. Fabianski could do nothing as it flew past him into the net.\n\nThere was bedlam in the ground but still there was time for another twist as Rangel chose the end of the match to turn auxiliary striker. Running on to Fer’s long ball, he took one touch to control and another to finish coolly under Hennessey. Suddenly it was a figurative six-pointer after all.\n\nClement will now take full charge and Curtis says the former assistant to Carlo Ancelotti believes he can keep Swansea up. “I think that’s why he took the job,” Curtis said. “He had the security of a top job at Bayern Munich but he wanted the challenge. I told him if I was him I would have stayed in Germany.”"}, {"date": "03/01/2017", "arena": "Bet365 Stadium", "attendance": 27010, "home_team": {"name": "Stoke City", "lineup": [{"name": "Lee Grant",

Crouch enabled Stoke City to cruise to their second victory in six weeks against opponents bedevilled by injuries to at least nine players.\n\nOlivier Giroud caps Arsenal’s fightback to earn point in Bournemouth thriller Read more\n\nMazzarri does not fear for his job as Watford’s manager because he claims there is a consensus at the club to build for the future. Mid-table momentum can be everything at this stage of the Premier League season and while Stoke won for the first time in a month, a fifth successive away defeat continued Watford’s alarming nosedive.\n\n“I don’t feel under pressure, because I speak with our owner [Gino Pozzo] every day,” Mazzarri said. “We know our objectives and we are not here just looking at the next five or six matches, we are looking together for the next three years. With the injuries we have, in the Premier League these results can happen. Now we look for solutions.”\n\nWatford may have put in a much more concerted effort than in the humiliation at home against Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday but the points count was the same at a club where managerial security is seldom held sacred. Mazzarri, Watford’s eighth manager in four and a half years, arrived at Vicarage Road on a three-year deal in the summer.\n\nHe admitted it was a gamble to recall Valon Behrami from a hamstring injury against Stoke but said: “Because of the total emergency we are in, I took responsibility to make Behrami play.”\n\nWatford have been linked with an £8m bid for Brentford’s free-scoring striker Will Hogan and they are also believed to be interested in signing Henri Lansbury, the Nottingham Forest playmaker. Mazzarri said: “The problem is the January transfer market is not very easy. In 15 years, I have not had the injuries in one season we have now but we still have the quality to recover.”\n\nEven though Stoke started a point worse off than Watford and without a win in five matches, their approach reflected far better spirits. At least they had performed well in losing at Chelsea and Liverpool.\n\nThe Watford players certainly appeared to give their all for Mazzarri but he still left the field shaking his head and clasping his hands together as if in prayer at half-time. For with virtually the last kick of the half, Shawcross half-volleyed home as he ran unmarked on to Charlie Adam’s corner. It was the Stoke captain’s first goal for almost exactly two years.\n\nWatford went for broke after half-time, introducing a second striker in Odion Ighalo for Behrami and almost immediately Abdoulaye Doucouré forced Lee Grant into a superb diving save. Within four minutes Crouch, having scored in the 4-2 defeat at Chelsea on Saturday, claimed his 98th Premier League goal when Sebastian Prödl totally missed Adam’s cross.\n\nCrouch should have scored again 15 minutes from time but almost comically mistimed Ibrahim Afellay’s cross for the ball to fall to square to Jon Walters, who also failed to convert. Prödl headed wide in a burst of Watford pressure late on, but Walters and Shawcross both went close as Stoke saw out the game comfortably.\n\nSwansea’s Àngel Rangel sinks Crystal Palace to give Paul Clement hope Read more\n\nGrant should convert his loan move from Derby County into a permanent deal, for a fee of around £2m, once the goalkeeper has tied “up a few loose ends at the Derby end” while Stoke are looking to take up a one-year option to extend Crouch’s contract at the end of this season.\n\n“We are speaking about it,” Mark Hughes said. “We’ve got the option to do that. This is my fourth season here and I haven’t seen any diminishing of his powers.”\n\nThe Stoke manager added: “He’s not just in the squad because he’s a good guy. He’s great, got no ego and while he’s been frustrated and knocking on my door asking why he’s not been in the team, I’ve reassured him he’s an important part of what we’re doing here. He’s hoping he can get his century. Very few British strikers have scored 100 Premier League goals and he deserves to.

The result still keeps both teams comfortably above the bottom three but Claudio Ranieri and Aitor Karanka may need to improve the attacking potency in order to move further away from danger. Boro are in negotiations to sign Aston Villa’s Rudy Gestede but Karanka would not be drawn on the mooted deal.\n\nThe only real moment of controversy came in the first half when Adama Traoré felt he deserved a penalty after going down under the challenge of Robert Huth. The admirable defender said afterwards “we got lucky” but Ranieri’s response was more to the point, the Leicester manager saying: “If that is a penalty, I’m the pope.”\n\nBoth sides made five changes from their matches on New Year’s Eve and the first half was a fragmented one as a result. Leicester offered little width while Boro often found themselves in strong attacking positions only to be let down by the end product.\n\nThe champions held a two-point advantage over Middlesbrough before kick-off and Karanka spoke beforehand of the importance of the match because it came against a relegation rival. Leicester’s two points from nine away games before this match on Monday is the joint lowest total by defending top-flight champions but they have enjoyed a far superior record over Boro in recent times, not losing in their past 13 meetings.\n\nLeicester started well, with Shinji Okazaki causing problems with his usual injection of energy and a persevering run from the Japan forward saw the ball at the feet of Christian Fuchs on the left-hand edge of the penalty area but the full-back dragged his shot wide.\n\nFor Boro, their best outlet was Traoré who continues his season of wonderful runs and woeful crossing. On more than one occasion the Spaniard beat his man down the right before failing to deliver a telling ball but he was certainly Middlesbrough’s most dangerous threat.\n\nIn the 18th minute Traoré went down on the edge of the area with the referee, Robert Madley, giving nothing, before setting up his team’s best chance of the half moments later. Traoré drove to the byline and squared the ball across goal for Marten de Roon, but the midfielder could fire only over the crossbar with his first-time effort.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest No way past Robert Huth and Wes Morgan for Gaston Ramírez.

I want to finish the transfer market with a better squad than we have now.\n\n“It was a good result for us, I’m really pleased with the performance. We saw when we played away we were better then them [Leicester] and we showed today we are better than them.”\n\nFriend had at least made an impact for Karanka’s side and the full-back cut inside from the left in the 68th minute, beat two defenders before slicing wide.\n\nMiddlesbrough 0-0 Leicester City: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nLeicester came close when Leonardo Ulloa headed a corner straight at Brad Guzan, but the game was descending into a low-grade affair.\n\nGaston Ramírez went close to snatching a late goal, firing a low shot into the side netting after a poor headed clearance from Wes Morgan, but no one deserved to win this match.\n\nRanieri said: “The performance was good, a good spirit.

Everton were much better than Southampton in the last 30 minutes was because they had one less day to recover,” said the manager who switched from St Mary’s to Goodison Park last summer. Honesty was the best policy; Southampton were physically and mentally shattered by the time Romelu Lukaku brought their cheerless festive campaign to a close.\n\nValencia, the Ecuador international on a season-long loan from West Ham United, was a major factor in a third consecutive league defeat for Claude Puel’s side, opening the scoring 11 minutes after replacing Aaron Lennon and winning the penalty that enabled Leighton Baines to kill the contest shortly afterwards.\n\nLukaku’s vast second-half improvement also contributed to breaking the visitors and he sealed Everton’s victory with an emphatic finish in dying minutes, his 89th goal on his 200th appearance in English football. But there was no disguising the consequences of three games in six days on the visitors.\n\nSouthampton had the edge in the first half, Jay Rodriguez squandering a fine opportunity, and there was little between the teams until Koeman increased his attacking options with Valencia, and Lukaku thrived with the extra support as the weary, retreating visitors cracked.\n\n“We started the season with many games,” Puel said. “We have played every three days, sometimes two, and we are 10th in the table with a programme like Real Madrid and Barcelona. Since Boxing Day we have played three games in five days and it is just not possible [three in six]. We tried to give a good answer, we did for 70 minutes, but we couldn’t give a good answer in the end. For a long time it was a balanced game. It is difficult to accept this result.”\n\nEverton, who are close to signing the Charlton Athletic teenager Ademola Lookman in a deal worth around £11m, gratefully accepted the chance to stretch tired legs. Ross Barkley, the impressive 18-year-old Tom Davies, Séamus Coleman and, most of all, Lukaku probed continually late on, stayed patient, and punished a Southampton side that featured six changes to the team beaten by West Bromwich Albion on New Year’s Eve and lost Cédric Soares within seconds of the kick-off when he careered into advertising hoardings and suffered a head injury. Puel must have been resigned to a long afternoon from that moment on.\n\nKoeman started with Davies and the 19-year-old Dominic Calvert-Lewin in an attempt to freshen his options – the first time two teenagers have started a Premier League game for anyone this season – but the striker’s full debut came to an unfortunate and abrupt halt when he suffered an ankle injury. The disruption and fatigue produced a sterile first half in which Southampton’s defensive organisation and intelligence on the counterattack held firm.\n\nThey should have led when Rodriguez collected Jordy Clasie’s ball with his back to goal, spun away from Davies, evaded Ashley Williams and, with only Joel Robles to beat, skied his shot high over the bar. A costly miss.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Everton’s energy levels told as the game wore on, with Lukaku’s influence improving in tandem with his first touch. Coleman’s raids down the right offered an important outlet against a deep defence and they combined to telling effect for the breakthrough. Lukaku released the Irishman to the byline and also met the inviting cross that came back with a downward header. Fraser Forster saved with a foot, the rebound bounced off Lukaku’s thigh and dropped perfectly for Valencia to convert from close range his first club goal for 12 months.\n\nValencia was then up-ended by Maya Yoshida as he attempted to turn on a pass inside the penalty area. Southampton had no complaints as Baines, Everton’s captain for the day, sent their goalkeeper the wrong way from the spot. Everton’s final goal was reward for Lukaku’s second-half contribution and evidence of Southampton’s lethargy. José Fonte was easily dispossessed by Baines as he attempted to bring the ball out of defence and Davies pierced the visitors’ defence with a fine ball into the feet of the Belgium international. Forster had no chance as an unstoppable shot flew high into his net.\n\n“We needed something different up front,” Koeman said on the introduction of Valencia. “That’s why we started with Dominic behind Romelu. I wasn’t happy with the support from the midfield for Romelu in recent weeks but then we lost Dominic and you need to change it.\n\n“You either bring Enner straight in or wait until late in the game. He was one of the players who changed the game and created difficulties for Southampton. It’s good to have him, he can play different positions and gives me the possibility to change systems, but it’s still too early to make a final decision about his future.”"}, {"date": "02/01/2017", "arena": "Etihad Stadium", "attendance": 54463, "home_team": {"name": "Manchester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Claudio Bravo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bacary Sagna", "yellows": [71], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nicolás Otamendi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aleksandar Kolarov", "yellows": [71], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gael Clichy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [58], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yaya Touré", "yellows": [41], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fernandinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [32], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jesus Navas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Kevin De Bruyne", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Raheem Sterling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [89]}, {"name": "Kelechi Iheanacho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}], "subs": [{"name": "Pablo Zabaleta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nolito", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sergio Agüero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [62], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willy Caballero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Silva", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Stones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [89], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aleix García Serrano", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Burnley", "lineup": [{"name": "Tom Heaton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matthew Lowton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Keane", "yellows": [80], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Mee", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [70], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stephen Ward", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "George Boyd", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Scott Arfield", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [88]}, {"name": "Jeff Hendrick", "yellows": [38], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Johann Berg Gudmundsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [59]}, {"name": "Andre Gray", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Barnes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [69]}], "subs": [{"name": "Sam Vokes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [69], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Patrick Bamford", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [88], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Defour", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [59], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paul Robinson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Tarkowski", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tendayi Darikwa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aiden O'Neill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "This hard-fought win left lingering uncertainty over just how good Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City are. There was little of the carousel pass-and-move play the Catalan yearns for and though victory is the bottom line, no hard evidence exists his side will secure a Champions League place for next season, never mind the title.\n\nLiverpool drop two points as Jermain Defoe strikes twice from the spot Read more\n\nWith Ilkay Gündogan out for the rest of the season due to injury, Guardiola could ill-afford to lose another midfielder. Yet off went Fernandinho in the first half for a second Premier League red card (and third in all) to rule him out for four games, thus taking City’s tally to seven dismissals this season. Guardiola was decidedly upset and in his subsequent refusal to accept the side have a disciplinary problem indicated he is feeling the strain.\n\nCity were gifted the ideal moment to blow away the blues from their defeat at Liverpool during the first exchanges. A careless pass from Ben Mee ceded possession and Kelechi Iheanacho was through on Tom Heaton. The goalkeeper showed his quality as he smothered the Nigerian’s shot and when the ball diverted to Yaya Touré he might have attempted a shot himself. Instead, he found Raheem Sterling and when the forward let fly Heaton once more saved Burnley.\n\nSeconds later Touré easily turned the away defence and slipped in Iheanacho but after the forward dallied, Michael Keane made a block.\n\nKevin De Bruyne disappointed by firing the subsequent corner straight at George Boyd and this became the tale of City’s afternoon: a series of let-downs near Burnley’s goal. When Sterling led a breakaway following a rare Burnley corner his pace took him into opposition territory. Yet after the ball went to Jesús Navas the Spaniard’s left-foot cross lacked conviction.\n\nNavas was one of four changes Guardiola made for the match – he dropped David Silva, John Stones, Sergio Agüero and Pablo Zabaleta and in came Iheanacho, Bacary Sagna and Gaël Clichy.\n\nFernandinho’s sending off came in the 32nd minute after he tackled Johann Berg Gudmundsson with both feet raised. It appeared the correct decision and from this point City became more ragged and the first half ended with Aleksandar Kolarov, De Bruyne and Sterling all having been outmuscled. Only Touré had been an asset against a Burnley team that offered scant threat.\n\nGuardiola may have had a few choice words for his players during the half-time interval. He also appeared to admit his error in selecting Navas and Iheanacho as on came Silva and Agüero. The manager had also implored the City crowd to make more noise but after a brief increase in volume they became as becalmed as their team.\n\nIf the idea of introducing Silva was to increase the tempo there was an early sign it might work. His interplay with the under-par De Bruyne led to the ball being under Agüero’s feet in the area but Stephen Ward cleared. But then came the opener: Sagna floated in a ball from the right and it went all the way across the area to Clichy. After a shimmy the left-back let go with his right boot and scored only the third goal of his City career.\n\nFour minutes later the lead was doubled. De Bruyne raced forward and delivered his best pass of the match, to Sterling, who received and advanced on Heaton. But the forward fell over, which allowed the goalkeeper to stab at the ball only for it to fall to Agüero and his shot pinballed off a post and Matthew Lowton’s arm into the net to make it 2-0. It took Agüero to 17 for the season and to third on the all-time list for the club, equal with Colin Bell’s 153 goals.\n\nAt this point City should have coasted but instead Burnley pulled one back. Claudio Bravo flapped at a corner and from the ensuing melee Mee forced the ball home – marginally, goal-line technology showed. City were not happy and surrounded the referee, Lee Mason, and assistant referee Ian Hussin, which led to a yellow card for Sagna.\n\nThe home side just about clung on – Keane went close at the death – and Guardiola must be concerned at precisely where they go from here.\n\nThe Burnley manager, Sean Dyche, said: “Bravo? I’ve seen it back, I think it’s just a goal. Two honest challenges, it drops then goes in. Just part of the game. I actually thought we did better 11-v-11. The way we shut them down from playing out was very good.”\n\nCity are on 42 points, seven behind the leaders, Chelsea, who also have a game in hand. Cue more irritability from Guardiola regarding their title prospects. “Yesterday, no,” he replied. “Why are we in the title race today?”"}, {"date": "02/01/2017", "arena": "Stadium of Light",

That came 12 minutes after Mané had given the visitors the lead for the second time on an afternoon when Daniel Sturridge also scored, and impressed enormously, before limping off with an unspecified ankle injury the manager trusts is not overly serious.\n\nJordan Pickford’s knee injury has offered Mannone a chance to show off his goalkeeping reflexes and they looked reassuringly sharp as the Italian dived smartly to repel Sturridge’s early low shot before tipping away Georginio Wijnaldum’s curler.\n\nIt was a bitter afternoon, with temperatures hovering just above freezing, but Mannone must have felt increasingly warm as he kept out another curving shot, dispatched by Sturridge this time, following some fine approach work on Roberto Firmino’s part.\n\nMannone, though, is only human and after his defence had failed to deal with the fallout from a James Milner corner in the 20th minute, Dejan Lovren’s miscued shot bounced into Sturridge’s path and from around six yards out, the sometime England striker directed a looping header into the net.\n\nWhile that was only Sturridge’s second Premier League goal this season, Defoe soon registered his 10th, equalising from the penalty spot after Didier Ndong stole between Wijnaldum and Ragnar Klavan as he accelerated into the area and the latter sent him tumbling. Although Simon Mignolet guessed the direction correctly, Defoe’s low, unerring execution proved far too good for the Belgian keeper as the ball arrowed snugly inside a post and into the bottom corner.\n\nWest Ham remain extremely keen on spiriting Sunderland’s leading scorer back to east London but that represents a doomsday scenario Moyes surely cannot even bear to contemplate.\n\nWithin minutes of drawing level, Sunderland should have taken the lead after Adnan Januzaj’s fancy footwork set up Defoe for a shot Mignolet performed wonders to get a hand to and push away, with Fabio Borini directing the rebound wide.\n\nMoyes had dubbed his players “useless” – among other things – after they surrendered 4-1 at Burnley on Saturday but rearranged in a 4-4-1-1 formation they, initially at least, seemed in much better shape. So much so that Mignolet was required to make a couple of decent saves from Defoe and then Jack Rodwell before Sturridge scored the opener.\n\nKlopp, meanwhile, simply looked frozen through as he shivered on the touchline. The German was furious about having to play again less than 48 hours after his side’s New Year’s Eve tea-time win over Manchester City and as Liverpool’s attempts to bypass John O’Shea and Papy Djilobodji in the Sunderland defence became increasingly jaded, those dire prophecies of physical and mental fatigue appeared close to fulfilment.\n\nYet even though the visitors were missing the injured Jordan Henderson and Philippe Coutinho, and were further hampered by rather flat displays from Adam Lallana, Emre Can and Wijnaldum in particular, they continued to dominate possession and should really have regained the lead when Nathaniel Clyne crossed well but Mané somehow missed the most inviting of openings.\n\nMoyes was convinced his team should have had another penalty after Borini’s chip struck Can on an arm but it did not look deliberate and the referee had no hesitation about waving play on. Liverpool, meanwhile, felt they might have had a penalty of their own due to Seb Larsson’s tug on Clyne.\n\nIt seemed the sort of day when set pieces would decide matters but Klopp’s players belatedly rallied and proved they were not quite all out of ideas after all. Lallana and Sturridge exchanged passes before Lallana’s cute backheel cued the striker up for an angled shot Mannone performed acrobatics to divert to safety.\n\nWhen the resultant corner was inadvertently flicked on by Djilobodji, it fell to Mané who, completely unmarked at the far post, guided it into the net from close range.\n\nNot for the first time, Sunderland paid the price for slapdash defending, with their protestations Mané had been in an offside position irrelevant as Djilobodji’s intervention played him onside.\n\nCreditably refusing to fold, Moyes’s side fought back and won another penalty. It came after Defoe collapsed in the face of a joint challenge from Lucas Leiva and Can and Larsson’s resultant free-kick was handled by, of all people, Mané who blatantly, ridiculously, stuck an arm up.\n\nUp stepped Defoe again. This time, he sent Mignolet the wrong way, the ball flying low into the same corner as his first as Sunderland stuck two strictly metaphorical fingers in Klopp’s direction."}, {"date": "02/01/2017", "arena": "The Hawthorns", "attendance": 23402, "home_team": {"name": "West Bromwich Albion", "lineup": [{"name": "Ben Foster", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Craig Dawson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gareth McAuley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [62], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonny Evans", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [30]}, {"name": "Chris Brunt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [49], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Darren Fletcher", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Claudio Yacob", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nacer Chadli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [62]}, {"name": "James Morrison", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [73], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matt Phillips", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Salomón Rondón", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [87]}], "subs": [{"name": "Allan Nyom", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [30], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonas Olsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Hal Robson-Kanu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [62], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Craig Gardner", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Boaz Myhill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James McClean", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [87], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Brendan Galloway", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Hull City", "lineup": [{"name": "David Marshall", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Maguire", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Dawson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Curtis Davies", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [84]}, {"name": "Ahmed Elmohamady", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jake Livermore", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Huddlestone", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Samuel Clucas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robert Snodgrass", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [21], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dieumerci Mbokani", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [65]}, {"name": "Adama Diomande", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Andrew Robertson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Meyler", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shaun Maloney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eldin Jakupovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Weir", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Markus Henriksen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [84], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Mason", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [65], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Mike Phelan urged Hull City to show more commitment after they slipped to another damaging defeat. His side gifted West Bromwich Albion two goals in a 3-1 loss at The Hawthorns, their ninth game without a win in the Premier League.\n\nChris Brunt, Gareth McAuley and James Morrison capitalised on poor defending to seal Albion’s comeback win. Robert Snodgrass opened the scoring, but Hull fell apart after allowing Brunt a free header to equalise four minutes after half-time.\n\nHull are second-bottom in the Premier League table, three points from Crystal Palace in 17th, and Phelan, the manager, said: “We have to be more courageous and braver and sometimes take a knock.\n\n“You can’t just be a pretty boy, you have to get your body or something on it. When it is a one-on-one situation you have to carry out that duty. For 45 minutes that was probably as good as we have played. We got the goal and we were in control, but the game doesn’t last 45 minutes and we suffered again. You can’t win games by playing nice neat football, you have to do the dirty bits at the other end. There’s only so much we can prepare and the staff do it really well and the players are aware of that. After the game it’s annoying they didn’t carry those bits of detail out.”\n\nRomelu Lukaku blasts home to secure Everton win over Southampton Read more\n\nHull are without an away win in the league since August, with Snodgrass’s goal their first in the top flight outside the KCom Stadium since October, and Phelan knows he needs reinforcements. “I’ll be having those conversations again, we have to look at it, we are now into the month so hopefully we’re not waiting until the 28th or 29th to do our business.”\n\nAlbion are eighth and have their second‑best points haul, 29, after 20 Premier League games. This victory followed a 2-1 win at Southampton on Saturday and Tony Pulis, the manager, rejected any talk of players being tired after two games in 48 hours. “If you tell people they’re tired, they’ll be tired – you don’t have to do too much to convince them,” he said. “Two games in three days playing professional football, for the money they get?\n\n“Go and ask their grandfathers what it was like working seven days a week down the pit, 12-hour days, they never got tired. We have done it right, but never mentioned they’d be tired.\n\n“Have a look around, a couple of our big [local] rivals have lost in the Championship, so don’t take anything for granted. As soon as you take your foot off the pedal, apart from the top six, the rest of us have to be on it every game to get a result.”\n\nJonny Evans sustained a calf problem and with Allan Nyom joining up with Cameroon for the Africa Cup of Nations, Pulis admitted the injury may change his transfer policy. “I don’t want to bring players in for the sake of it although looking at Jonny, and Nyom going away, we might have to get a couple of defenders in which we weren’t expecting to do.”"}, {"date": "02/01/2017", "arena": "London Stadium", "attendance": 56996, "home_team": {"name": "West Ham

still oddly inevitable 2-0 defeat of West Ham United pegged out around two decisive moments.\n\nAsked afterwards about decisions going his team’s way, José Mourinho offered a playful show of innocence, agreeing that his own decision to rejig his team’s attacking personnel had made the difference. This was only half the story. The real turning point here was a Mike Dean joint, the Premier League’s most theatrically exhibitionist referee choosing to send off Sofiane Feghouli with 15 minutes gone after a challenge with Phil Jones that saw both men tackle strongly for a loose ball.\n\nWith the match scoreless at half‑time, Mourinho took his own moment to intervene, demonstrating the muscle in this United squad by bringing on Juan Mata and then after nearly an hour Marcus Rashford, who combined for the opening goal. Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s second near the end, lashed in coming back from an offside position, continued his own sublime run of form, a 12th goal in 12 games that will no doubt once again have his critics, such as they are, eating their balls.\n\nSlaven Bilic felt hard done by at the final whistle after a disciplined West Ham rearguard. But despite some obvious fatigue at the tail end of the festive thrash, United still looked like a team gathering momentum. Victory in a bitty game, 48 hours after their previous win against Middlesbrough, leaves them in sixth and playing here with a sense of strength in reserve.\n\nWest Ham United v Manchester United: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nThere was a stodginess to the early exchanges on a chilly night in east London. West Ham brought the first waves of noise rolling around this vast, open, egg‑shaped bowl, Feghouli and Dimitri Payet putting Manuel Lanzini in space for a low shot that David de Gea plunged to palm wide.\n\nWith 15 minutes gone the key moment in the match arrived. Michail Antonio chested the ball back towards Feghouli, who stretched to reach the ball, as did Jones. No studs were raised. It looked like a hard but fair challenge, although Jones came off worse. The referee took his time and then flourished – the word is apt – a straight red card.\n\nIt was a poor decision in many ways, a needless intervention that skewed the entire night for players, TV viewers and the near 57,000 people inside the stadium. As mistakes go it was at least on a fittingly Olympian scale, in keeping with the hauteur of a referee whose sweeping gestures suggest each match he attends is a spectacle made up of three interlocking forces, Team A, Team B and Mike D.\n\nThe flow of possession switched immediately. Michael Carrick began to tick in midfield as West Ham fell back into a hard-pressing 4-3-2 shape. Mourinho had made five changes to his starting XI, with Anthony Martial replaced by Jesse Lingard. In theory the front line retained its balance of speed and mobility either side of Ibrahimovic but on this wide pitch and against a team down to 10, Martial’s absence seemed significant. Havard Nordtveit was a fill-in at right back but United barely troubled him in the first half.\n\nThey should still have scored with 34 minutes gone. Ibrahimovic played a crossfield pass to Henrikh Mkhitaryan. He found Antonio Valencia in the middle. His weak, scuffed shot was straight at Darren Randolph, who scooped it away on the line. The ball trickled to Lingard, who somehow managed to hit the post. On the touchline Mourinho whirled around in search of someone to share his disgust with before spotting the rest of his dugout 50 metres behind him in one of the bubbles of empty space left by jamming a football pitch into this borrowed stadium.\n\nWest Ham had their moments, Lanzini’s curling shot drawing another clawing save from De Gea. Half-time arrived accompanied by a chorus of Dean-related boos, only partly drowned out by a blast of jarring and irrelevant music from the deafening stadium PA. At which point Mourinho made the change that would prove decisive, bringing Carrick back into defence and sending on Mata to lurk usefully just behind Ibrahimovic.\n\nFor a while things continued to almost happen. Cheikhou Kouyaté escaped without a card after a horrible tackle on Mkhitaryan. Antonio almost got his head to Payet’s free-kick. With United dominant but lacking punch, Mourinho brought on Rashford for Lingaard to test that right side with some thrust coming in from the touchline.\n\nThe home team still fought gamely, Lanzini skittering forward to put Antonio in on goal with a lovely little through pass. De Gea saved with his legs, but Antonio had time and space to find a corner. He really should have scored.\n\nWest Ham were punished two minutes later with a goal made and scored by Mourinho’s two substitutes. Rashford ran at Nordtveit, beat him twice and laid back a neat pass for Mata. His finish was instant, drawing a roar of pent-up relief from the away supporters.\n\nUnited were cruising now as West Ham’s energy levels sagged.

A second away win by this margin in four days could not have been more convenient preparation for Chelsea’s visit to White Hart Lane on Wednesday and any suggestion that they might take their eye off the ball against opponents with previous for inconveniencing bigger names was quickly rendered unnecessary by the sheer paucity of Watford’s offering.\n\nIt is hard to imagine that a home side will play this inadequately during the rest of 2017. Injuries had played havoc with Walter Mazzarri’s plans, but that does not completely excuse the sluggishness and basic errors that peppered the performance of a relatively experienced starting XI. Tottenham were merciless in response and seized upon the home side’s repeat offences, the snatched clearance from Younès Kaboul that teed up Dele Alli to score a third goal – and end any lingering doubts over the outcome – four minutes before half-time providing a faithful snapshot of the afternoon’s events.\n\nNone of that is to detract from the encouragement Tottenham, whose four-game winning run gives the impression of a team easing into gear after a patchy autumn, will take from a match they controlled entirely. Alli, recapturing last season’s levels of effervescence, was a delight to watch and Mauricio Pochettino will have been equally happy that he could rest his midfielder for the last third of the game. Harry Kane looked as sharp as at any time this season and then there was the performance of Kieran Trippier, who has been a forgotten man due to the excellence of Kyle Walker but took advantage of his team-mate’s suspension to lay on both of Kane’s goals. He remains one of the division’s most technically gifted right-backs and this was a reminder that Spurs possess important depth in what, for them, is a vital area of the pitch.\n\nTrippier had already created a chance for Danny Rose when, spotting Kane’s angled run in the inside-right channel, he met it with a clever pass round the defence. Kane beat Heurelho Gomes confidently and from then on it was a question of how many Tottenham would score.\n\nSix minutes later it seemed anyone’s guess. Trippier’s next trick was a wonderful, half-volleyed cross from the right flank that bypassed the home centre-backs for Kane to jab home emphatically. Watford players were not without reproach, Kane showing far more hunger than the two he beat to the ball, but the delivery had been virtually unplayable.\n\nIt was a perceptive, first-time switch across field from Alli that supplied Trippier with the time and space to centre. That was entirely characteristic of the midfielder’s performance, which could have been crowned by a spectacular goal when a 25-yard shot rapped the bar seconds before Kane opened the scoring, but was still rewarded soon enough. Alli was deft, alert, brain and feet operating yards ahead of anybody in a yellow shirt. Craig Cathcart might have prevented him from seizing on to Kaboul’s mistake, but this was a day when 50-50 contests had only one winner and his finish was unerring.\n\nThere was a similar outcome when, found with half of the penalty area at his disposal from Kane’s cross 58 seconds into the second half, Alli was faced with Gomes a second time. The result was the same and had the option been available, both sides would surely have wound things up there and then.\n\nWatford’s supporters had booed after the third goal but saw the rest of the game out as quietly as their team. Much as Kaboul’s scrambled injury-time consolation was insignificant, it was a jolt to the senses inasmuch as they had never threatened anything of the sort. “We were growing during the season and then out of nowhere we miss five very important members of the team,” said the Watford manager. “If you took that number from any other team in the Premier League they would also be in big difficulty.”\n\nMazzarri had said before the game that he needed “a priest” to rid Watford from a litany of problems that had included early injuries to Daryl Janmaat and Valon Behrami in the Boxing Day draw with Crystal Palace. Nobody with access to a higher power appeared to have listened; Watford were forced into a reshuffle when Camilo Zúñiga suffered an ankle injury in the warm-up and that set the tone for their afternoon. Zúñiga’s replacement, Odion Ighalo, went on to underline the sense that the form with which he began 2016 was very much against the norm.\n\nThe task for Tottenham is to make sure that this level of performance becomes a regular occurrence against better opposition. “It was nearly a perfect game,” Pochettino said, and more of the same against the leaders on Wednesday would give the next 51 weeks a tough act to follow in improving on this first one.\n\nWatford v Tottenham Hotspur: Premier League – live!

But when Olivier Giroud blurred the line between the virtually real and the gloriously tangible, he did more than set Arsenal on their way to victory over Crystal Palace. He lit up the Emirates Stadium and provided a memory for years to come.\n\nGiroud’s 17th-minute opener recalled the finish of Henrikh Mkhitaryan for Manchester United against Sunderland on Boxing Day. There were shades of a scorpion kick, albeit with only one leg; a rainbow flick or whatever else the gamers want to call it.\n\nBut when Giroud’s back-heeled flick – recalled from a distance behind him and on the run, too – arched in off the underside of Wayne Hennessey’s crossbar, the stadium and the watching TV millions felt their jaws drop. Even Giroud looked a little stunned.\n\nArsenal 2-0 Crystal Palace: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nArsenal coasted to the points thereafter, with Alex Iwobi providing the tempo and incision in the No10 role in the absence of Mesut Özil, who was ill. Iwobi added the second goal; a looping header after Palace had left him unmarked only four yards out. Palace’s defending continues to be a cause of high anxiety.\n\nSam Allardyce’s team had a brief flurry around the hour mark but it was not an afternoon when the club’s new manager could trumpet too many positives with any conviction. It said much that he substituted Yohan Cabaye, Andros Townsend and Christian Benteke well before the end, with one eye, perhaps, on conserving energy for the home game against Swansea City on Tuesday.\n\nGiroud’s goal transcended the occasion and if the finish was a thing of exquisite class, it was worth going over every detail of the buildup, including the striker’s role in it, which was crucial.\n\nAfter Lucas Pérez – who looked off the pace on a rare Premier League start – had slid in to intercept on the edge of his own area, Héctor Bellerín initiated the break with a sharp pass up to Giroud but it was what happened next that really got Arsenal moving. With his first back-heel, he found Granit Xhaka and he played in Iwobi who, in turn, made the right pass forward to Alexis Sánchez.\n\nGiroud had bolted up in support but, when Sánchez’s cross arrived, it was a full yard behind him. No problem. Giroud adjusted his body shape and, in a moment of improvisational genius, he had reached back his left boot, located the ball and flicked it with his heel over his head and towards the roof of the net. Hennessey could do nothing to keep it out.\n\nThe first thought was of Mkhitaryan but Giroud was further out than the United forward – he was about 12 yards from goal – and the goalkeeper had looked better placed. As the Arsenal supporters who filed past the press box were also keen to point out, Giroud was onside; Mkhitaryan had been just ahead of the last man. Whatever the arguments, it was plain that Giroud had illuminated this game to a degree that went beyond merely shaping it.\n\nIn classic Giroud and Arsenal style, he had been guilty of a bad miss from an easier chance on seven minutes, after Xhaka’s dinked pass out to Nacho Monreal and the full-back’s low, first-time cross. In front of goal, Giroud could not set his feet in time and Mohamed Elneny’s follow-up shot was headed away by James Tomkins. Giroud had sorted himself out by the time that Sánchez crossed for him shortly afterwards.\n\nIt was only Giroud’s second Premier League start of the season but he now has five goals in the competition and the statistics show that they have come at a rate of one every 69.8 minutes. The next best record in the top flight belongs to Watford’s Stefano Okaka, who has scored once every 97.5 minutes.\n\nArsenal called the tune and it said everything that when Cabaye had a shot on target in the 37th minute, which was the definition of routine for the Arsenal goalkeeper, Petr Cech, the travelling fans celebrated wildly. “We’ve had a shot, we’ve had a shot,” they chorused, sarcastically.\n\nPalace’s chaotic streak at the back, which Allardyce has been charged with stamping out, was evident in first-half stoppage time, when a Bellerín cross sparked such panic that the only surprise was the Keystone Cops did not arrive on the scene. With Martin Kelly all over the place, Iwobi won the ball and Sánchez had a chance from close range. His shot, though, was too close to Hennessey, who blocked. Arsène Wenger would lament his team’s failure to kill the game sooner than they did.\n\nPalace were poor in possession in the first half but they had what Allardyce described as “our defining moment” on 47 minutes, when Townsend crossed for Benteke and one of the best headers of a ball in Europe found himself up against Bellerín at the far post. He failed to get a clean connection and the effort bobbled wide.\n\nThe visitors had their purple patch after Iwobi’s goal, which followed Monreal’s cross and Scott Dann’s diversion high into the air. Benteke worked Cech with a header from a corner and Cabaye went close with the follow-up while Kelly swung and missed when well placed and Cech was made to save by Townsend. This game, however, was all about one player and one moment.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Olivier Giroud twists to score his superb opening goal for Arsenal against Crystal Palace.

ban for historical homophobic tweets, maintained his excellent form.\n\nLast year’s Championship player of the year helped Burnley win promotion and Dyche believes there is more to come from the former non-league striker. “He’s still a work in progress and he can only add to his confidence level and belief playing at this level,” he said. “I don’t think any player just arrives in the Premier League and you just roll out there and learn instantly, some but not many. It takes time. I’ve said about people like Steven Defour still adapting to what the Premier League offers and Andre’s the same – he’s had an unbelievable journey in the last four seasons and he’ll continue to learn. All of our players are. He’s got that fearless streak in him if he misses.

We’re in the bottom three, I know that.”\n\nWith Victor Anichebe also picking up a hamstring injury, Sunderland enter a new year with little reason for optimism. “We have always said if we could do we would, but everyone knows we have got restraints,” Moyes said of possible signings. “I think with what we have got, of course we need help. So let’s hope maybe something happens and we can do that. Ellis [Short, Sunderland’s owner] is saying let’s see what’s out there, and maybe we can do something.”\n\nDyche will see little reason to spend greatly. At the end of 2016, when his side won 14 of their 22 games at home and lost only three, the Burnley manager reflected on a memorable 12 months.\n\n“It’s certainly a very strong way to finish off a very important calendar year,” Dyche said. “We got promoted and were almost instantly written off. I think it’s a strong mentality to keep looking beyond that and saying what are we about, what can we focus on and what can we deliver in order to win games.\n\n“There’s a nice humility about us because we know we’re not the real deal, we know we’re not just going to run through the Premier League and run over everyone but there’s an inner belief.”"}, {"date": "31/12/2016", "arena": "Stamford

a frenzy of a contest to see out the year with the leaders, untouchable since the end of September, savouring a 13th victory in succession. Stoke City offered far more of a test of the leaders’ credentials than plenty of others in that sequence but still ended defeated, even if there was no disgrace in that. It is more than three months since anyone found a way of checking this team. They appear unstoppable.\n\nPaul Pogba caps dramatic fightback to save Manchester United’s winning run Read more\n\nThe next side to try will be Tottenham Hotspur, bitter rivals still smarting from the critical damage inflicted to last season’s title challenge here back in May, but they will do well to contain them.\n\nChelsea were pegged back twice by an impressive Stoke team, the hosts’ back-line unnerved by Peter Crouch, but the leaders’ self-confidence never wavered. They continued to sweep forward, convinced those forays would yield reward, and, eventually, buried Stoke’s intent beneath a two-goal lead.\n\nIt was Diego Costa who settled the occasion, thrashing home a wonderful 14th club goal of the term from a tight angle after turning Bruno Martins Indi five minutes from time. Only then could Conte skip down the touchline in delight in the knowledge the day was truly won.\n\n“When you win a lot in a row, there is a great danger to be satisfied too early,” he said. “It’s not easy to show the character and reaction, above all after 12 wins in a row. After their second equaliser, we could easily be relaxed and think that, in the end, we’ve won a lot in the past so a draw, if we don’t win, is not important. But my players showed a great will to fight, a great will to win, a great will to take this great achievement for us. I’m pleased for them and they deserve this.”\n\nThis equalled the record for consecutive victories within a single season and another at White Hart Lane on Wednesday would bring Chelsea level with Arsenal for the all-time winning tally – set over two campaigns – of 14. Conte has made clear he cares little for such statistical achievements though, in the context of last season’s toils and this side’s apparent shortcomings in the autumn, the sequence already feels remarkable. It is astonishing to think they have dropped eight points by the season’s halfway point, and played in a fashion which has provoked admiration rather than envy from most onlookers. The challenge will change from now on in.\n\n“We started this season as underdogs, underestimated,”said Conte. “But now the light is on Chelsea. We’ll have to work harder still to find, game by game, the right solution and carry on winning. It won’t be easy but, today, we are very happy.”\n\nThis had been a real test of their credentials. Stoke were awkward opponents, Crouch unsettling a back three who had only previously been breached twice in 12 matches. It was the former England striker who leapt above Gary Cahill and nodded Charlie Adam’s deep free-kick back across goal for Martins Indi to volley the visitors level 55 seconds into the second period.\n\nThe 35-year-old forward would be rewarded himself just after the hour-mark with his team’s second equaliser, side-footed in from the edge of the six-yard box from Mame Diouf’s centre after N’Golo Kanté had missed his kick with the home side’s rearguard, initially shrinking from Crouch, pulled out of position by the substitute Bojan’s dart into enemy territory.\n\nThere were other awkward moments when Chelsea threatened to conceded again. Yet, where Stoke intent could never be questioned, their defending proved more accommodating.\n\nMark Hughes was left to bemoan the winner – “a throw-in which bounced in our six-yard box” – and the lapse of concentration that led to parity squandered immediately on the second occasion the visitors drew level, but acknowledged the opponents were devastating on the break.\n\nLee Grant’s superb reactions had frustrated the home side for a while, but some of the fragility that blighted Stoke’s start to the season has crept back in of late. Too many of Chelsea’s rewards were easily achieved.\n\nAndre Gray grabs hat-trick as Burnley leave Sunderland floundering Read more\n\nCahill’s header from Cesc Fàbregas’ corner had forced them ahead, though it was Willian who would edge them back in front twice thereafter. Victor Moses’s flash of skill dumped Erik Pieters on the turf, the wing-back’s cross touched into the Brazilian’s path by Eden Hazard and the left-foot finish unerring.\n\nHis second came from Fàbregas’s 100th Premier League assist, a pass placed inside Pieters that Willian hammered home.\n\nHe had been Chelsea’s player of the year in last season’s toils and having initially lost his place after being granted compassionate leave following the death of his mother he is now back to his best.\n\n“We all know the difficult period through which he passed. So I’m pleased for him,” said Conte. “He’s a really good guy and deserves this.”\n\nThis whole squad will go into the new year buoyed.

The champions will not retain their title, but this timely reassertion of the virtues that earned them their proudest honour at least suggested they are primed to avoid an undignified descent into the relegation zone. Not that Claudio Ranieri is making any bold declarations in that regard: he counts points, not chickens, but he acknowledged that this tenacious performance was a step in the right direction.\n\n“It has been an amazing, unforgettable year and 2016 will remain in our hearts and minds,” he said. “But it was important to win here and see our fans supporting us and our players fighting together.”\n\nRanieri had similar thoughts three weeks ago after the rousing victory over Manchester City but his team did not sustain their form after that, which is why it remained their only victory in nine league matches before this one. That run had left Ranieri facing accusations that his persistence with the 4-4-2 system that served his side so well last season amounted to trying to make cake from stale bread. He concocted a new formation for this match and it worked a treat. But an even bigger factor than the switch to 4-2-3-1 was the attitude of the players. They played with the zest and resilience that had made them kings.\n\nWillian double sinks brave Stoke and extends Chelsea run to 13 straight wins Read more\n\nNo Leicester player stood out because all played well. Islam Slimani scored the winning goal but the display of his Algerian compatriot Riyad Mahrez was equally notable given that the latter’s performances had fallen so far below the level that earned him the Premier League player of the year crown last season that he had been dropped for the last home match. Although he did not quite reach the heights of last term, he responded in the way Ranieri had hoped. Deployed just behind Slimani, Mahrez gave flickers of his brilliance, justifying the decision to assign him a central role rather than a wide berth.\n\n“It was important to change something because now all the world is waiting for Riyad on the left or right to come inside, we have to improve how we find him between the lines,” Ranieri said.\n\nIt took 63 seconds for Mahrez to show he was on song, but Darren Randolph prevented him opening the scoring by tipping his half-volley just over the bar.\n\nWest Ham could not match Leicester’s early intensity and slickness. Marc Albrighton and Demarai Gray were excellent out wide, ensuring a regular supply of threatening crosses. Slimani met one from Albrighton in the fourth minute but the striker’s header rebounded out off the post.\n\nA similar move in the 20th minute produced the breakthrough. Quick thinking and passing by Danny Simpson and Danny Drinkwater launched the attack before Albrighton delivered another delicious cross from the right and Slimani headed powerfully into the net after peeling away from Winston Reid.\n\n“They deserved the goal, it was a combination of their aggression and our sloppiness,” said Slaven Bilic.\n\nHal Robson-Kanu’s touch of class fires West Brom past Southampton Read more\n\nWest Ham soon got up to speed with their hosts. They provoked havoc in the home penalty area only to be thwarted by defenders who had rediscovered their sharpness, as shown by the number of timely blocks on shots. Even so, Leicester were lucky in the 41st minute when Michail Antonio’s shot cannoned out off the crossbar. The chance had been created by Aaron Cresswell, whose raids down the left were becoming a nuisance. They were not the only source of bother for Leicester – Simpson and Daniel Amartey had thrown themselves in front of shots by Antonio and André Ayew just before that and Kasper Schmeichel had made a fine close-range save to foil Dimitri Payet.\n\nA free-kick by Payet forced Schmeichel into another save just before half-time. Randolph then had to make an even better stop from a free-kick by Mahrez.\n\nWest Ham exerted strong pressure in the second half. Schmeichel made a high-class save on the hour to paw away a shot by Cresswell after it took a treacherous deflection off Ben Chilwell.\n\nWith the visitors on top, Ranieri replaced Mahrez with Christian Fuchs in an attempt to reinforce his team’s solidity. It worked. For the last stages of a helter-skelter contest that was generally clean despite being strewn with eight yellow cards, West Ham were for the most part kept away from Leicester’s goal.\n\nAndy Carroll’s header into the side netting was the closest they came to an equaliser thereafter. Leicester, indeed, ended the game on the attack and Carroll’s last significant touch was a block that prevented Chilwell from making it 2-0."}, {"date": "31/12/2016", "arena": "Old Trafford",

Every feedback I give to players I give to improve players. Almost every day, I was having Henrikh Mkhitaryan’s agent calling me and saying: ‘Mkhitaryan with you will be a better player. Keep going.’ And with Martial, every day I read the newspaper – Martial goes to Sevilla, Martial goes on loan, he’s not happy. Martial needs to listen to me.\n\n“He’s a player with amazing condition to be a top player. He played, he created, he scored, he fought. He was very positive.”\n\nHaving been given two touchline bans, Mourinho chose his words carefully regarding the referee. “Mr Mason knows he made a mistake. It’s sad because referees are sad when they make mistakes.”\n\nOf the climactic end, he said: “In the last 20 minutes, the fans were on the pitch – they were not in the stands. And this is a credit to the players who showed amazing character to go and go and go and go.”\n\nA bright start featured both sides having chances to score. The visitors’ opening came when Adama Traoré dispossessed Ander Herrera near halfway. From there the winger raced straight towards David de Gea’s goal but Traoré dilly-dallied and the threat fizzled out.\n\nThis was about as good as it got for the next quarter of an hour as United peppered Víctor Valdés’ goal. As is becoming usual for this United team, Mkhitaryan and Pogba were often involved. At one point the latter headed on to the former and his overhead kick grazed Valdés’s right post.\n\nMkhitaryan also delivered a corner on to Marouane Fellaini’s head that the midfielder directed straight at Valdés. Middlesbrough emerged from this and issued a warning. Traoré’s pace beat Daley Blind and Chris Smalling. When he turned the ball across the penalty area to George Friend, De Gea was exposed but the left-back’s shot was blocked by Fellaini.\n\nMartial was having his best game in a long while. When the Frenchman hit a rocket at Valdés only his right-hand post saved Boro. However, the keeper was about to make himself unpopular at Old Trafford owing to the disallowed Ibrahimovic strike.\n\nYet again Martial was a key figure – his cross found the No9 who rose to stab home. Only after this did Ibrahimovic make contact with Valdés yet Mason, for some erroneous reason, ruled it out. Cue boos for the referee and for Valdés, who may have made a meal of the challenge.\n\nThis meant it was 0-0 as the second half began and United had 45 minutes to try to make their superiority count. Ibrahimovic was given a chance when Pogba fed him but his outside-of-the-boot attempt hit Valdés’s legs. Next, Pogba found the striker again and his cross-shot was nearly turned in by Mkhitaryan.\n\nOn 64 minutes Mourinho brought on Marcos Rojo for Blind and Mata for Fellaini. Now, though, came a blow: Calum Chambers pinged a ball in, Álvaro Negredo headed down, and Leadbitter struck. Marcus Rashford was thrown on and United went to three at the back.\n\nThen came their memorable finish and, as Aitor Karanka, the Boro manager, said: “When you come here and play against Man United and you are winning 1-0, every team has to play at their best to beat us.”"}, {"date": "31/12/2016", "arena": " Mary's Stadium", "attendance": 30975, "home_team": {"name": "Southampton", "lineup":

The Welshman scored one of the goals of Euro 2016 during his country’s run to the semi-finals and he struck again here with an absolute rocket to claim three points in his first start for West Bromwich Albion.\n\nIn an evenly matched first half Shane Long headed Southampton into the lead, before Matt Phillips restored parity with a calm finish after a fluid move. But the game’s memorable moment came from Robson-Kanu and Tony Pulis was happy to sing the praises of the forward he signed as a free agent last summer.\n\n“He is that type of player who’s so wholehearted, he gives everything all the time,” Pulis said. “I had no problem playing him; the problem came in leaving Salomón Rondón out. Hal’s been wonderful as a backup, if you like, but he showed today he’s kept his fitness high and was ready for his chance. I’ve got a choice to make on Monday now.”\n\nIslam Slimani heads relieved Leicester to victory over West Ham Read more\n\nAfter two consecutive away matches, the Baggies now return to the Hawthorns to face Hull on Monday in good heart. For the Saints, however, their Christmas has turned sour. After receiving a thrashing by Tottenham, this was a second consecutive home defeat and there were boos at the final whistle.\n\nTheir manager, Claude Puel, chose to rotate his side for the second of three fixtures in six days. But his decision to rest three of his first-choice back four looked odd even before the match. The only defender to retain his place, Virgil van Dijk, was sent off with minutes of the match remaining and will now miss Monday’s match against Everton at Goodison Park.\n\n“Yes, you can say [you have regrets] after the result but if it’s not this game it would be the next game‚” Puel said of his changes. “We are the only team playing three games in six days, just us, and our squad have been playing many games since the beginning of the season. It was normal to make a rotation with all these games and I think it’s not the rotation that was the problem, it’s a problem of concentration and a problem of the calendar.”\n\nAndre Gray grabs hat-trick as Burnley leave Sunderland floundering Read more\n\nAfter a predictably physical opening, Southampton broke the deadlock with a goal their visitors would have been proud of. After seeing their passing triangles simply break against West Brom’s compact defence, the crowd favourite Dusan Tadic used the chance of a corner to whip a wonderful ball to the near post, which Shane Long met with a decisive header. Coming against one of his old clubs, it was the Irishman’s first league goal of the season.\n\nBefore the crowd had even finished celebrating, the Baggies were level. And their goal was equally uncharacteristic – an attractive move from open play. Chris Brunt played a one-touch pass round his marker to Robson-Kanu who, in turn, poked it to Matt Phillips. Cool as required, Phillips stepped inside Maya Yoshida and fired the ball low past Fraser Forster.\n\nAll square at half-time then, but it turned out Robson-Kanu had just been warming up. Just as he did during those summer nights in France, the striker pulled a world-class finish out of nowhere, thrashing the ball from 25 yards past both an unsuspecting Van Dijk, then the keeper and into the roof of the net.\n\nSaints went two up top almost immediately, but that only proved an invitation for West Brom to do what they do best. The closest Saints got to a shot on target was when Ben Foster cleared the ball into an onrushing Jay Rodriguez. With the game about to enter added time, Van Dijk earned his second yellow card after tangling with the substitute Rondón.\n\nThe Dutchman, currently the subject of so much transfer speculation,

advertisement for the Swansea City manager’s job, this was about as damaging as it gets, yet a fourth successive defeat and the prospect of taking over the Premier League’s bottom team have not discouraged Paul Clement from accepting the offer to replace Bob Bradley.\n\nClement, Carlo Ancelotti’s No2 at Bayern Munich, has agreed in principle to become Swansea’s third manager of the season, with the 44-year-old to be appointed in the next 48 hours and expected to meet the players before Tuesday’s Premier League game at Crystal Palace.\n\nThe paperwork has yet to be signed, but Swansea are confident that Clement will take a leap of faith and hopefully breathe fresh life into a group of players who look resigned to relegation. Totally outplayed by Bournemouth, Swansea are four points adrift of safety and it is difficult so see how Clement could take any positives from their latest listless performance.\n\nWillian double sinks brave Stoke and extends Chelsea run to 13 straight wins Read more\n\nFirst-half goals from Benik Afobe and Ryan Fraser, followed by a late third from Josh King, allowed Bournemouth to ease to the most straightforward of away wins with Jack Wilshere outstanding in an advanced midfield role.\n\nThe margin of victory could have been even wider, such was the gulf between two clubs that set out to play the same way but are heading in opposite directions. Bournemouth are up to 10th place. Swansea are anchored to the foot of the table and staring at the possibility of playing Championship football next season unless they can produce an act of escapology to rival just about any other that the Premier League has witnessed over the years.\n\nAlan Curtis, who was asked to take charge on a caretaker basis, talked about a crisis of confidence, yet there is a glaring lack of quality as well as self-belief. Bournemouth were superior in every department, controlling possession to such an extent that it felt like they were the home team. “Bournemouth were excellent,” he said. “They probably did to us what we used to do to teams.”\n\nNext up for Swansea is the trip to Selhurst Park, where Clement is expected to watch from the stands. Highly rated as a coach, Clement has worked with the world’s top players as Ancelotti’s assistant at Chelsea, Paris Saint-Germain, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich. Yet his managerial experience is confined to the eight months he spent in charge of Derby last season and he is walking into a huge challenge at Swansea.\n\nThe club have lost eight of the past 12 games and conceded 32 goals in the process. Those sort of statistics will not be turned around on the training ground alone. Swansea need new players as badly as a new manager. But how much money will the club’s American owners be prepared to throw at what looks like a lost cause and, perhaps more to the point, what sort of players could Swansea hope to attract?\n\nFor the moment Curtis is ploughing on, preparing the team for the Palace game and doing his best to sound upbeat. “Naively or what, I still think there should be enough there to get better results,” he said. “But confidence in football is such a fragile thing. There are good players but once we concede you can see the confidence draining out of them.”\n\nAfobe opened the scoring and it was the 14th time in 19 Premier League matches that Swansea have conceded first. It was also another piece of awful defending. Fraser, released by Wilshere, crossed from the left and Jordi Amat, who was surprisingly recalled, miscued, spearing the ball towards his own goal. Lukasz Fabianski managed to keep it out but Afobe was there to turn in the rebound, pivoting six yards out to sweep a left-foot shot past the Swansea goalkeeper.\n\nHal Robson-Kanu’s touch of class fires West Brom past Southampton Read more\n\nWilshere was also involved in Bournemouth’s second goal, which was brilliantly worked and encapsulated what Eddie Howe’s team are all about. Harry Arter, Simon Francis and Junior Stanislas also played a part in a slick move down the Bournemouth right that ended with Fraser turning home from inside the six-yard box in first-half injury-time. “That was the key moment – we were dominating but the game’s on a knife-edge,” Howe said. “It was one of the goals of the season for us.”\n\nThe Bournemouth manager was full of praise for Wilshere, who showed some lovely touches and set up further chances for Stanislas and Afobe early in the second half. Those opportunities were squandered but the predictable third goal arrived two minutes from time when Charlie Daniels released King and the substitute sprinted clear before slipping the ball past Fabianski, wrapping up three points for Bournemouth and leaving Swansea with one hell of a survival battle on their hands."}, {"date": "31/12/2016", "arena": "Anfield", "attendance": 53120,

Georginio Wijnaldum’s goal inflicted the damage and the 10-match winning sequence with which Pep Guardiola introduced himself at Manchester City is starting to feel like a deception. This was another erratic display and, however it is dressed up, City’s owners did not bring in Guardiola to be 10 points adrift at the halfway point of the season.\n\nLiverpool 1-0 Manchester City: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nLiverpool played with great panache at times and, in other periods, they showed the kind of durability that will be essential to sustain a title challenge. The players in red never gave their opponents a moment’s peace in the first half but after the break, when they switched to a more conservative system, they can also take great encouragement from the fact City had lots of the ball but did not create one clear opportunity.\n\nWhat never shifted was the impeccable attitude of Liverpool’s players whereas their opponents, in contrast, took an age to get going. Once the visiting team started showing some urgency, with Raheem Sterling, David Silva and Kevin De Bruyne growing into the game, they did at least make a fight of it.\n\nYet it would be generous to say they deserved anything considering the story of the 90 minutes and, once again, they came away from Anfield filled with regret. They have not won here since 2003 and Sergio Agüero has not scored at this ground in eight appearances. The Argentinian, back from a four-match suspension, barely got a sniff.\n\nKlopp’s men scored 87 league goals in 2016, their highest figure since managing the same in 1985. More importantly, there was hard evidence here that if any team can chase down Chelsea it is likely to be the one with the liver bird on their chest.\n\nAt one point Roberto Firmino could be seen miscontrolling the ball to concede a throw-in and there was still warm applause. There is a vibe here reminiscent of the near-victorious season now infamous for Steven Gerrard’s slip. The crowd can see a team who are giving everything and, in their latest victory, a set of players who looked desperate to show their superiority.\n\nJames Milner plays Mr Dependable in Liverpool’s new era of unflappability | Paul Wilson Read more\n\nFor long spells, they did exactly that – quick to the ball, strong in the tackle and playing in the knowledge that if City’s defence are placed under pressure a mistake will generally follow. City have kept only four clean sheets from their 19 league fixtures in the Guardiola era and Aleksandar Kolarov, in particular, had a difficult match.\n\nThere is nothing particularly new about that but it was rare to see City look so incoherent in attack, particularly in the opening 45 minutes when Sterling, facing his former club, seemed disorientated by the crowd’s jeers and even Silva, of all people, could be seen misplacing relatively simple passes. Sterling’s early anxiety disappeared in the second half when he started reminding his old club of his threat. Yet Liverpool, holding on to their early lead and switching to a counterattacking system, still looked the more threatening side, albeit with less of the ball.\n\nPerhaps the best compliment that can be paid to Wijnaldum for his goal is that there are Liverpool supporters of a certain generation who will remember John Toshack scoring headers of this nature. It was a prodigious leap but, more than anything, it was the sheer will on his part to meet Adam Lallana’s cross with the necessary blend of power and precision. The ball flashed past Claudio Bravo and Liverpool had scored for the 23rd successive top-division fixture on their own ground.\n\nPep Guardiola says he learned from Jürgen Klopp and praises attacking style Read more\n\nCity had an argument that Ragnar Klavan, already booked for a challenge on Agüero, might have been shown a second yellow card shortly before the goal. Yet any grievance on their part does not alter the fact they made an almighty mess of the free-kick, leading directly to the game’s decisive moment. Yaya Touré’s decision to aim it out to the left wing was strange in itself and Kolarov’s touch to give the ball away was clumsy in the extreme.\n\nCity were vulnerable as soon as Firmino played the initial forward pass, giving Lallana the chance to make ground on the left, and Kolarov’s ignominy was compounded by the fact that when he made it back to the penalty area he was the player Wijnaldum out-jumped. That Kolarov was at fault twice probably summed up his evening.\n\nIt was not until the game was approaching the hour-mark that Guardiola’s team started to pass the ball with speed and clarity. Silva and De Bruyne switched positions and both became increasingly influential. Yet whatever Guardiola is trying is not working. Not yet anyway.\n\nLiverpool were barely troubled during four minutes of stoppage time and the game finished with Klopp embracing his players, blowing kisses to the crowd and looking forward to

as the UK’s City of Culture for 2017 takes place on Sunday as the hangovers wear off. On this evidence Robert Snodgrass’s left foot should be among the primary exhibits.\n\nFor the threadbare hopes of its football club’s top-flight future appear to hang on the Scotland international’s use of it. Snodgrass has now converted or created exactly half of Hull’s 16 Premier League goals, and for 20 minutes his sixth of the season, an exquisite free-kick, threatened to atone for his compatriot David Marshall’s first-half howler.\n\nHull City 2-2 Everton: Premier League –as it happened Read more\n\nThat it did not and that Hull sit one point off the bottom rather than three is down to another recurring theme: an inability to turn good performances into wins. Having handed Ronald Koeman’s team one equaliser on the stroke of half-time, via Marshall’s sliced punch into his own net, they conceded a second to the recalled Ross Barkley’s late header.\n\nHull, refusing to be deflated by the final 20 minutes of their defeat on the same turf by Manchester City on Boxing Day, started adventurously and took a sixth-minute lead through their second-top scorer, the central defender Michael Dawson. Like Snodgrass’s it was a quality finish.\n\nNeither did Mike Phelan’s team lack spirit. “We are off the bottom of the league,” Phelan enthused. “At times this season things haven’t gone our way but the players are all putting a real shift in. They are listening, learning and have everything to look forward to, which is progress up this league. We have a real battle on our hands in the second half of the season but I think we’re up for it.”\n\nPhelan spoke in the build-up to this contest of the need to reinforce his squad with players “courageous” enough for the fight ahead. Yet it is the grossest of understatements to say that Hull is an even harder sell now than when he did his last recruitment pitch in August on the back of wins from both their opening fixtures.\n\nNor have his set of summer transfer window purchases proved a raging success. Ryan Mason, the club’s £12.5m record signing from Tottenham, went missing in a relegation duel at Middlesbrough in the first week of December and has not been spotted in a starting XI since; neither has Markus Henriksen, whose permanent £3.5m move from AZ Alkmaar is to be ratified next week; Dieumerci Mbokani has been praised for his hold-up play but is yet to score in 10 appearances since returning to the English top flight.\n\nTwo former Manchester United trainees Will Keane and Mike Weir have proved peripheral. The Scotland goalkeeper Marshall, a moderate success, has shipped an average of 2.42 goals a game, and showed himself prone to panicking under pressure soon after Dawson’s finish from a flicked-on Snodgrass corner had put Hull ahead.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest David Marshall punches the ball back into his own net for one of the most bizarre own goals of the season. Photograph: Greig Cowie/BPI/REX/Shutterstock\n\nThe sucker punch, quite literally, came in first-half injury time, when Kevin Mirallas swung over a corner and Marshall was cramped by the presence of his own striker Mbokani in his attempt to fist away. The ball skewed backwards for one of the more bizarre Premier League goals of the season. “Everything is fizzing around your head – what you want to say to the players, you know exactly what you want to do and, when that happens with 10 seconds to go, it changes your whole thinking,” said Phelan, of his half-time team talk plans.\n\nJürgen Klopp finally gets a chance to face Pep Guardiola on level playing field | Andy Hunter Read more\n\nMarshall’s next touch three minutes into the resumption went the same way. Crucially this time, however, his fingertips proved the difference between Romelu Lukaku’s deflected drive hitting the crossbar and flying beneath it.\n\nThen, after Snodgrass found his range by striking the bar in the 55th-minute via a classical up-and-down free-kick – Leighton Baines’s header against the base of a post just shy of the quarter-hour was the first of the attempts against the frame of the goal – he put Hull back in front. One of Harry Maguire’s Beckenbauer-esque marches from deep was crudely halted by Baines, and Snodgrass got the trajectory just right, arcing the ball perfectly into the top corner despite Robles’ attempts to claw it away.\n\nKoeman cited the Yorkshire club’s potency from dead-ball situations – “we knew they’d scored eight out of 14 goals like that,” he said afterwards but conceded that nullifying Snodgrass’ quality was another matter. The same could be said of Hull’s attempts to muzzle Barkley, a player previously dropped as a “wake-up call” by Koeman. Appearing to have been energised by that, and perhaps by the fact Gareth Southgate was among the crowd, he emerged to head in Baines’ dink.\n\n“I hope it gives Ross a boost,” Koeman said. “I think he was the player that we expect in his position. We spoke about him being more dangerous in front of goal, to have better offensive movement and he was really important in the final part of attacking.”"}, {"date": "28/12/2016", "arena": " Mary's

Day or Tuesday, it might have felt pretty tortuous. But when they finally got their festive programme under way they made it count – and how.\n\nSouthampton 1-4 Tottenham Hotspur: Premier League – as it happened! Read more\n\nMauricio Pochettino’s team shrugged off a second-minute concession to Virgil van Dijk and a generally sloppy start to produce a show of strength, in which Dele Alli scored twice and both Mousa Dembélé and Christian Eriksen sparkled around him. Danny Rose was also excellent.\n\nSouthampton played the final 33 minutes with 10 men after Nathan Redmond’s sending-off for a foul on the goal-bound Alli and they were overwhelmed.\n\nThe visitors could even afford to miss a penalty in faintly comic circumstances – Harry Kane lifting his kick high over the crossbar after Redmond’s red-card offence – and they will remember it was in this fixture last December that they sparked their title charge with an impressive 2-0 win.\n\nThis performance was even more eye-catching. Kane had put them in front early in the second half, after Alli’s first-half equaliser, and they turned the screw once Southampton were a man down. The substitute, Son Heung-min, raced on to an Eriksen pass to drill home the third – it was the most clinical of finishes – and Alli gave the scoreline an emphatic feel with his second two minutes later.\n\nThe penalty/red-card double whammy, served up after considerable deliberation by the referee, Mike Dean, was the major talking point. It was a slick Tottenham counter-attack featuring Eriksen and Moussa Sissoko that had got Alli away and the chasing Redmond pulled at him from behind before they entered the area.\n\nThe Southampton winger then stumbled into Alli inside the box to make further, less obvious contact but it was still enough to knock the Tottenham player from his stride. Alli sent his shot wide as he went to ground. There was a dramatic pause as Dean considered his options, followed by a flourish when he flashed the red card.\n\nClaude Puel, the Southampton manager, said the decision was “a little hard” and difficult to accept as it was simply “two players fighting for the ball” and he insisted that it had killed his team’s chances. On the other hand Pochettino was entitled to point out that Tottenham had not only been 2-1 up at the time but were well in control. And there was little doubt that Redmond had committed a last-man foul on Alli at some point.\n\nThe penalty carried shades of David Beckham’s decisive miss at Euro 2004 for England against Portugal. When Kane planted his standing foot next to the spot he inadvertently created a divot beneath the ball and, in turn, he got horribly underneath the shot.\n\nKane said he had noticed before the game there was a relaid patch of grass just on the penalty spot while he also tweeted that “if there’s any NFL teams looking for a kicker in the future, have a look at my game tonight”.\n\nHe could afford to joke. Alli talked of Tottenham having made a big statement and nobody could disagree.\n\nRising stars: 10 players to watch in 2017 Read more\n\nThe only disappointment for Pochettino was in the yellow cards that Kyle Walker and Jan Vertonghen collected which will mean they are suspended for the trip to Watford on New Year’s Day. The manager is hopeful Toby Alderweireld – absent here because of a virus – will be available to return.\n\nPochettino saluted the character of his team and it was notable in what was a comeback win. Van Dijk had got in between Vertonghen and Rose to head home from James Ward-Prowse’s free-kick and for the first 15 minutes or so Southampton called the tune.\n\nIt was a sign of Tottenham’s irritation that Vertonghen left his hand across Jay Rodriguez’s face as if he meant it after making a clearance; the Southampton striker made no fuss and Dean took no action.\n\nSouthampton pressed hard at the outset and Redmond fizzed one low shot inches past Hugo Lloris’s far post.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Harry Kane’s penalty kick for Tottenham against Southampton sails over the bar. Photograph: Eddie Keogh/Reuters\n\nThe game turned on Alli’s equaliser. Dembélé initiated the move with a deft pass into the inside-left channel for Sissoko and, when his cross looped up off Redmond, Alli leapt in front of Van Dijk to direct a header in off the far post.\n\nTottenham had further chances before the interval. Eriksen blazed high and Victor Wanyama, booed on his return to Southampton, tricked through only to be denied by José Fonte’s block.\n\nSouthampton’s loss of hustle after their flying start was difficult to fathom and, when they lost their defensive bearings shortly after the second-half restart, they found themselves behind.\n\nIt said everything that Oriol Romeu was the nearest marker to Kane on Eriksen’s corner – and he was not close enough. Fraser Forster might have done more to keep out Kane’s header.\n\nFonte and the Southampton substitutes, Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg and Dusan Tadic, had chances while Eriksen rattled the crossbar on 71 minutes.\n\nBut when Son and Alli showed their clinical edge, it meant Southampton had conceded four goals at home in the Premier League for the first time since 1998."}, {"date": "27/12/2016",

visit on New Year’s Eve and another reminder to Chelsea and the watching Pep Guardiola that Liverpool will remain in their company for some time to come. But there was more to an ultimately comfortable victory over Stoke City than a further demonstration of the ruthless efficiency that Jürgen Klopp has created at Anfield. It took confidence under pressure and absolute faith in their methods for Liverpool to stage an emphatic recovery.\n\nWhen Daniel Sturridge rounded the goalkeeper Lee Grant and rolled in his first Premier League goal since April to complete victory he also took Liverpool to 100 league goals in 48 games under Klopp. Only Kenny Dalglish reached the century in as few games as Liverpool manager. The show of strength and the range of Liverpool’s attacking threat would not have been lost on Guardiola, whose presence in the main stand Klopp took as a mark of respect from a fellow contender.\n\nJürgen Klopp says Liverpool have Borussia Dortmund’s team spirit Read more\n\nBut it was unmistakable how the home team had toiled against Stoke’s direct approach and two-man attack until Adam Lallana equalised Jonathan Walters’ early goal and how, even when unsettled, Liverpool never lost their belief or ability to hurt their opponents. Stoke’s generosity was boundless, with individual errors contributing to all Liverpool goals, and Klopp had the options at his disposal to ensure there would be no first managerial win at Anfield for Mark Hughes or top-flight league win here for his team. Roberto Firmino, his place never in doubt according to Klopp despite being arrested for drink driving on Christmas Eve, and an own goal from Giannelli Imbula joined Lallana and Sturridge in completing the recovery.\n\nHughes believed Stoke had the players and the gameplan to hurt Liverpool and so it proved when they took the lead from their first period of sustained possession and continued to trouble the home defence until Lallana levelled in the 35th minute. Peter Crouch, deployed as the obvious outlet against his former club, headed Mame Diouf’s cross goalwards and, though Ragnar Klavan hooked clear, Sadio Mané was slow to react to the second ball. Erik Pieters easily won their aerial challenge and delivered an inviting left-wing cross to the near post where Walters arrived ahead of Dejan Lovren. The Republic of Ireland international and boyhood Evertonian steered a glancing header beyond Simon Mignolet at his near post. Mignolet got a hand to the ball but was unable to redirect its path.\n\nJoe Allen, who prospered in the first half on his return to Anfield, almost doubled the visitors’ lead when Jordan Henderson and Lovren failed to clear and he weaved his way into the area and shot low towards the far corner. Mignolet produced a vital save with his foot, the ball spun away from Crouch lurking in front of an open goal to Walters, and his follow‑up was blocked by Klavan. Stoke would have other opportunities on the counterattack but none as clear as that key moment. Liverpool heeded the warning and were ruthless once they awoke.\n\nHenderson and Lallana went close, Firmino closer still when he reacted quickest to a Ryan Shawcross clearance and beat Grant with a low drive that Crouch cleared on the line. The pressure was growing but Stoke had defended well until a lapse by Glen Johnson offered Klopp’s team a way back in. Divock Origi produced a fine piece of centre-forward play to shield possession under pressure then spray the ball out to Mané on the right. His cross was met with a heavy touch by Lallana but, instead of clearing for a corner, Johnson miscontrolled and invited the England international – being watched by the national manager Gareth Southgate – to slip a clinical finish inside Grant’s near post from a tight angle. The pattern for the rest of the game had been set.\n\nFirmino edged Liverpool ahead moments when he collected James Milner’s pass inside the area and found himself with time and space to pick his shot, despite Allen, Johnson and Shawcross being in proximity. The Brazil international produced a fine finish that kissed the inside of both posts before crossing the goal-line. Stoke complained to the referee Michael Oliver that play should have been halted with Mané lying injured in an offside position. He was neither interfering with play or responsible for the weak defending that continued unabated in the second half.\n\nAny hopes Stoke harboured of a point were destroyed when Imbula started and finished a flowing move. Unfortunately for the visiting midfielder it came at the wrong end of the pitch. His poor header, under no pressure, gave possession to Henderson who unlocked the Stoke rearguard with a fine pass inside Johnson to Origi. The Belgium international crossed low and hard and the recovering Imbula converted into his own net under pressure from Mané.\n\nSturridge delivered Liverpool’s fourth 56 seconds after replacing Origi and thanks to a careless back-pass from Shawcross. The Stoke captain never looked up as he played Johnson’s square ball straight into the feet of Sturridge, who ended his uncharacteristic recent drought in the Premier League.

The last time he had overseen a competitive match had been in Trnava back in September as Adam Lallana’s stoppage-time winner kickstarted England’s World Cup qualifying campaign with a 1-0 victory over Slovakia. Yet here he was cast again in that familiar role of firefighter, charged this time with hauling Crystal Palace away from the relegation zone, and being quizzed post-match about the antics of a man who spends every other week dressed head to foot in a comedy hornet outfit.\n\nIt was not supposed to be like this. He could concentrate on the promise conjured by a welcome point gained in Palace’s struggle against the drop, and cite disappointment that his team had been so wasteful in fluffing their chance to double an early lead as Heurelho Gomes saved Christian Benteke’s dreadful first-half penalty. Yet, as he familiarises himself with new surroundings, his adjustment to life after England, with whom his tenure had not extended beyond 67 days, may take time. He has inherited a team shorn of confidence, a group whose ambition rather shrunk as this game progressed despite the very clear shortcomings of their hosts. It was Watford who felt the more relieved to have secured a draw.\n\nThe nonsense with the mascot reflected Palace’s frustrations. The incident was born of Miguel Britos’s challenge on Wilfried Zaha as the game drifted towards its conclusion, the winger crumpling to the turf only to be booked by Mark Clattenburg for simulation. There had been clear contact on the visiting player, though the locals – presumably relieved the referee had not been persuaded to award a third spot-kick of the afternoon – delighted raucously in the caution. There is history between Zaha and Watford, born of penalties won in the 2013 play-off final and a league game here last season, yet the sight of Harry the Hornet launching himself into a wildly dramatic dive in front of the 24-year-old on the touchline after the final whistle was probably a little unnecessary.\n\nAllardyce dismissed it as something for Watford to address. Or maybe the Premier League, or even his former employers at the Football Association. “Everything doesn’t have to be a drama,” chuckled Walter Mazzarri, the Watford manager, though Zaha had been incensed and had to be dragged down the tunnel. The Palace manager presumably had not heard the Tannoy announcer’s reference to home supporters being free now to enjoy “a pint of wine” over what remains of the festive season, recalling footage from the newspaper sting which cost him his job with England. Allardyce probably spends his life braced for such sniggers these days.\n\nHe might also have predicted the equaliser. Palace have not kept a clean sheet away from home in a year and, for all that they ensured Watford did not muster a shot on target until beyond the hour-mark, the nerves crept back into their play as this game drifted into its last quarter. Damien Delaney’s grapple with Sebastian Prödl at Adlène Guedioura’s corner was ill-advised, the award legitimate, and the centre-half’s caution rules him out of the trip to the Emirates Stadium on Sunday.\n\nTroy Deeney had waited almost 800 minutes of football to convert his 100th goal for this club, and duly thumped the penalty down the middle and in. “I’ve been having a bit of a stinker recently, so it’s a huge weight off my shoulders,” he said. “The gaffer had every right to drop me.” It had been Valon Behrami’s departure, following that of Daryl Janmaat after only four minutes, which had seen him summoned from the bench.\n\nIf only Benteke had been so decisive with his own spot-kick. Palace had been the slicker side in that first period, with Zaha and Andros Townsend tormenting their markers and Yohan Cabaye imperious in a playmaker’s role. The Frenchman had rammed in the visitors’ goal, turning neatly on to Townsend’s fine pass with the winger having left two opponents utterly bamboozled by his twisting run. When Gomes clipped Benteke as he reached Prödl’s poorly placed back-pass nine minutes from the break, Palace had their opportunity to double the lead.\n\nThe Belgian took the resultant spot-kick himself, staggering his run up as ever, but his effort was weak and blocked by the diving goalkeeper. It was the ninth save Gomes has mustered from 30 Premier League penalties at two clubs, a remarkable record even if Benteke’s attempt was dismal.\n\n“You have to get in the mind of the player that is going to kick,” said the goalkeeper. “I saw some of Benteke before the game, he came to the ball so slow, so I knew that if I waited I could get the right side.” That technique will have to be re-assessed, with this Palace’s third penalty miss of the campaign. Had they all been scored, the team would have been five points better off and ensconced in mid-table.\n\nThat is food for thought for Allardyce as he seeks about instigating a revival. In time, he may consider this a decent enough start. It just felt as if it could have yielded so much more."}, {"date": "26/12/2016", "arena": "Emirates Stadium", "attendance": 59925, "home_team": {"name": "Arsenal", "lineup": [{"name": "Petr Cech",

results,” said the France forward. “It is a big relief.”\n\nOf all those of an Arsenal persuasion, however, there was no one more relieved than the manager. As the clock ticked towards full-time and the first supporters began to drift away, one dreaded to think how Arsène Wenger would recover from a third game without a victory after the disappointment of successive defeats at Everton and Manchester City.\n\nAs he acknowledged, West Brom are not the opponents anyone would pick in such circumstances, given their reputation for dogged resilience, and it looked as though an inspired performance from their goalkeeper, Ben Foster, would be how this game was remembered until Giroud’s late header following an inch-perfect cross from Mesut Özil.\n\n“With 10 minutes to go I thought we could play a draw or maybe, if we were not intelligent, even lose the game,” Wenger said.\n\n“We kept going and in the end, whenwe couldn’t make a difference on the ground, we made it in the air, with maybe the only player in our team who can do that.”\n\nGiven the season he has endured, there was a certain irony that it was Giroud who found the breakthrough. Alexis Sánchez has enjoyed such success playing through the middle that this was the Frenchman’s first Premier League start of the season, in the absence of the injured Theo Walcott, and for the majority of the afternoon it was easy to see why as he struggled to make an impact.\n\nHe had skied his only opportunity in the first half, then picked up a yellow card and another foul on Claudio Yacob less than three seconds after the restart may have hinted that this was not going to be Giroud’s day.\n\nYet his perseverance was rewarded in fine style as he won the physical battle with Gareth McAuley to meet Özil’s cross with a looping header that left Foster with no chance.\n\n“He put his hand across him early and outmuscled him,” said the West Brom manager, Tony Pulis, almost in admiration. “I think if Gareth takes a step forward, then he stops Giroud pinninghim. Once he pinned him he is so strong and overpowers him. I’ve got no complaints.”\n\nWest Brom have faltered recently, suffering defeats at Chelsea and Manchester United, but they remain a difficult team to break down.\n\nHad Yacob shown more composure when the ball fell to him after Petr Cech’s fumble following a corner midway through the second half, then they could easily have snatched three points against an Arsenal side who looked there for the taking at times. But that escape seemed to spark the hosts into action, with Özil finally waking from his slumber to provide the one moment of real quality that ultimately proved decisive.\n\nAs ever, it was not for the want of trying from Sánchez, who could consider himself unlucky to be denied twice by Foster and between times by a post in a matter of minutes after the break.\n\nAs it was, Giroud’s goal threatened to open the floodgates and the substitute Aaron Ramsey could easily have added some gloss to the scoreline late on. But any more than a 1-0 victory would have flattered the home team.\n\n“The confidence is swinging and depending highly on the result,” said Wenger. “We have lost two on the trot so of course the confidence has been hit. But it’s a good test for the team. There is no season without disappointment, so it was interesting to see how they responded to disappointment.”\n\nWith matches between now and the end of January against Crystal Palace, Bournemouth, Swansea City, Burnley and Watford, there should be optimism that Arsenal’s title challenge may not be over just yet and this was exactly the kind of result that could spark another run of victories.\n\nBut Wenger will know his hopes of overhauling a Chelsea side who have won all 12 of their matches since the 3-0 defeat here at the end of September are now out of their hands.\n\n“Maybe, yes,” he replied when asked whether this team is more resilient than it has been in recent years. “It’s normal to say yes but we have to show that for the whole season to maintain that resilience.\n\n“ We are quite a big distance behind Chelsea and we will need a special resilience to come back.\n\n“But I hope that the other teams will have their moments of weakness as well. We can only take advantage if we continue like that.”\n\nManchester United’s Mkhitaryan rounds off easy win over Sunderland Read more\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Alexis Sánchez cut a frustrated figure as Arsenal struggled to break down the West Brom defence.

"report": "Burnley were outplayed for much of this game yet still managed to leapfrog Middlesbrough in the table and become the first of the two promoted sides to reach 20 points thanks to a stunning late decider from Andre Gray.\n\nFor 80 minutes the game looked to have nil-nil written through it; after spending over an hour cancelling each other out in trying conditions both sides appeared ready to settle for a draw by the time Burnley managed to open up their opponents with a smartly executed bit of route one attacking. Middlesbrough had spent the previous 20 minutes looking marginally more likely to score, yet they were caught cold as Tom Heaton sent a free-kick up the middle, Sam Vokes won the header to nudge the ball forward and Gray struck with a perfectly executed right-foot volley for his first goal since August..\n\nLeicester’s gloom darkens after Romelu Lukaku seals win for Everton Read more\n\nIt had to be perfectly executed too, for Víctor Valdés had the shot covered until the ball squirmed out of his grasp at the last moment and crept across the line behind him. The only goal of an unmemorable game will therefore go down as a goalkeeping mistake, a gift from the visiting defence, yet Gray deserves a huge amount of credit for the venom and accuracy he packed into his shot. He could hardly have struck it any better, and after getting down low to reach the shot at the foot of his left-hand post, Valdés must have been as surprised as everyone else by the power Gray had been able to summon.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Burnley’s Andre Gray scores the only goal of the match with 10 minutes remaining. Photograph: Craig Brough/Reuters\n\nBoth sides had chances in an untidy and fractious first half, though there was little actual football to rewar d supporters for braving a chilly Lancashire afternoon. Mostly that was due to a stiff breeze blowing the length of the pitch that made control difficult, though there was also a touch of needle between two teams who came up from the Championship together last season. Middlesbrough could have taken an early lead when Cristhian Stuani stole behind the Burnley defence to reach Antonio Barragán’s long ball over the top, but after getting himself into a good shooting position the forward missed the target with only Tom Heaton to beat.\n\nBurnley took a while to hit their stride, with Boro’s neat, short-passing game helping them gain dominance in midfield, but gradually they pushed forward and managed to create a couple of scoring opportunities. Valdés had to scramble an Ashley Barnes shot around the foot of his post, Dean Marney had an appeal for a penalty turned down when Calum Chambers appeared to handle, though the closest the game came to a goal before the interval was a George Boyd shot from a free-kick on the edge of the area that Valdés appeared to misjudge in the air before pushing away. Boyd was Burnley’s liveliest attacker, beating Fábio da Silva twice in the move that led to the penalty shout, when Marney also appeared to be impeded in the act of shooting.\n\nWest Ham’s Andy Carroll twists the knife into Bob Bradley and Swansea Read more\n\nThe second half opened with Craig Pawson managing to spot a Marney handball, conceding a free-kick on the edge of the area for illegally blacking a Marten de Roon shot, yet though Gastón Ramírez took an age to line up his shot all he came up with in the end was the gentlest of prods straight at Heaton. The Burnley goalkeeper had to work harder a couple of minutes later to keep out a Stuani header as Boro suddenly upped the tempo, with Stephen Ward perhaps the luckiest of 11 players cautioned in the game not to see red for a scything challenge on Barragán.\n\nGray joined him in the book shortly afterwards as Burnley began to find themselves pushed back into their own half, though when Vokes joined the fray for the final quarter the home forwards were able to have the last word. Boro must have left the field feeling mugged, but even they would have to acknowledge it was a heist of the highest class. Not that Aitor Karanka was feeling particularly generous about the manner in which the match was settled. “We knew they would play long balls, we’ve been working on stopping them all week in training,” the Boro manager said. “It is frustrating to lose in that way when we did a lot of good things. We’ve lost from one ball in a match we had under control.”\n\nSean Dyche did not see it quite that way, though the Burnley manager agreed it had been a close contest. “It was one of those games where you just want a chance to come your way, and Andre is the ideal player to have on hand when that happens,” he said. “He took his one chance very well. The ball dropped out of the sky and he’s not overthought it, he’s hit it instinctively with power and pace.”"}, {"date": "26/12/2016", "arena": "Stamford Bridge", "attendance": 41384, "home_team": {"name": "Chelsea", "lineup": [{"name": "Thibaut Courtois", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "César Azpilicueta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Luiz", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gary Cahill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Moses", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Cesc Fàbregas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nemanja Matic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marcos Alonso", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willian", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [83]}, {"name": "Eden Hazard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [49], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Pedro", "yellows": [63], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [24], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Asmir Begovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Branislav Ivanovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kurt Zouma", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ruben Loftus-Cheek", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michy Batshuayi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathaniel Chalobah", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [83], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Temitayo Olufisayo Olaoluwa Aina", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Bournemouth", "lineup": [{"name": "Artur Boruc", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Simon Francis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steve Cook", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [90], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charlie Daniels", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Smith", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dan Gosling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andrew Surman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [66]}, {"name": "Harry Arter", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Brad Smith", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [77]}, {"name": "Jack Wilshere", "yellows": [14], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joshua King", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [66]}], "subs": [{"name": "Benik Afobe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [66], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Callum Wilson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Junior Stanislas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [66], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Federici", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Fraser", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tyrone Mings", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordon Ibe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [77], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Bournemouth became the latest side to try to find a way through Antonio Conte’s relentless Chelsea side at Stamford Bridge on Boxing Day. They also became the latest side to fall short.\n\nChelsea were missing both Diego Costa and N’Golo Kanté, ever present in the club’s march to the top of the Premier League. Bournemouth, meanwhile, switched their formation to a back three in an attempt to mirror and counter Conte’s successful shape.\n\nEddie Howe’s men were brave, determined and gave their all, but so did Chelsea and a difference in quality asserted to leave the home side just two games short of equalling Arsenal’s record of 14 consecutive victories in the Premier League.\n\nManchester United’s Mkhitaryan rounds off easy win over Sunderland Read more\n\nAll the talk before the match had been about Michy Batshuayi, Chelsea’s £33m striker who had yet to start for the club since joining in the summer but now had an opportunity in Costa’s absence. Conte however, considers the 23-year-old to be a work in progress. Instead, he opted to go without a No9 and with experience, as he pushed Eden Hazard through the middle with Willian and Pedro Rodríguez alongside him. Pedro scored twice while Hazard was successful from the penalty spot.\n\n“Eden has a real talent,” Conte said, “but the most important thing is that he is putting his talent into the team. It’s so important he is doing such great things with the ball and without it. It is fantastic, I hope he continues to improve in this way. I am pleased for him and I am pleased for all my players because they did so well.”\n\nChelsea’s altered lineup felt their way into the match and it was not until the 15th minute that Hazard managed to create space for himself around the box, a low shot coming to nothing after an exchange of passes with Willian. From that point, however, the Belgian just got stronger. His blind pass sent Pedro clear for an opportunity in the 21st minute and it was a brilliant dribble from the Belgian that led to the corner from which Chelsea scored the opening goal.\n\nCesc Fàbregas took the corner, but played it short before heading for the penalty area. The ball found its way to Hazard who once again span his marker and found his Spanish team-mate on the edge of the box. Fàbregas found the delicate through-ball and the onrushing Pedro who took one touch wide and then another to chip the ball back, over Artur Boruc and into the far side of the net.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Pedro leaves the Bournemouth defence standing with a chipped finish beyond Artur Boruc. Photograph: Frank Augstein/AP\n\nIt was a goal of real class, and an opening that came from nowhere. That is the quality Conte’s team have in their locker and for a minute Bournemouth looked shocked; they had matched the hosts for effort but could nothing to stop their quality.\n\n“I don’t think the first goal turned the game but it certainly didn’t help,” said a typically honest Howe. “We started well, looked solid and compact as a unit. I was pleased with how they were playing and then Chelsea produce a bit of magic. After that you’re looking at how you respond. We did well, had opportunities and it was the second goal that was a key moment in the game.”\n\nHowe’s appraisal of the game was correct; Bournemouth could have drawn level after falling behind and perhaps should have had a penalty when Adam Smith was brought to the ground. But come the second half Chelsea emerged with a determination to settle the encounter.\n\nNow noticeably sharper to the ball than Bournemouth, César Azpilicueta robbed them of the ball after Jack Wilshere played a pass marginally behind Harry Arter. Chelsea broke like a wild fire and advanced into the box with the defence on the turn. Simon Francis, who had struggled to get near Hazard in the previous 49 minutes, stuck out a leg and tripped the playmaker for a definite penalty. Hazard himself stepped up and send Boruc the wrong way to score.\n\nArsenal’s Olivier Giroud snatches late win against West Brom Read more\n\nTwo-nil may be a dangerous scoreline but it carries less risk for this Chelsea team, so effective are they in defence and so deadly on the counter. Five minutes after the penalty Hazard nearly scored again as Chelsea broke from one end to the other in seconds. Willian led and finished the next break, with Boruc doing well to hold the Brazilian’s shot. Moses drove just wide in the 58th minute, Pedro curled beyond the far post in the 64th. In between times there was an impudent vignette as Hazard worked his way around a prone Fàbregas by deftly lifting the ball over his body.\n\nChelsea were oozing confidence and Conte was also at his most animated, slapping his thighs in frustration at imperfections that were imperceptible to most spectators. His side gave up just one chance for the remainder of the game, Thibaut Courtois doing enough to stop a shot from the substitute Benik Afobe.\n\nConte’s final gesture was to instruct that the ball be cleared into touch so that Batshuayi could come into the play for the final seconds of added time. Instead Chelsea went on another counterattack, Pedro shimmied into space and hit a fearsome shot that deflected off Steve Cook and into the net.

Vardy masks, or the fact that Leicester City are the English champions.\n\nThe last time Leicester hosted Everton, in May, they were presented with the Premier League trophy; here all that was on display was a petty public relations stunt and a sad contrast between the title winners of last season and this Leicester side. Everton did not need to excel to claim their first away win since September.\n\nLeicester City give fans 30,000 Jamie Vardy masks to wear in protest at ban Read more\n\nEverton finished looking like accomplished travellers but overall this was a low-quality contest that made for particularly painful viewing for supporters of the home side. That included Vardy, who sat in the stands as he began his three-match suspension for his red card against Stoke City. Leicester had been so aggrieved at the Football Association’s rejection of an appeal against that ban that the club arranged for masks of their striker to be handed out before kick-off. Some kind of protest? Ranieri said he knew nothing about it. That, at least, was wise.\n\nVardy’s punishment must have felt particularly severe in view of the calibre of play he had to watch. The first 45 minutes were wretched, amounting to a late but compelling entry for the worst half of football in 2016. Everton were especially pallid initially and must have reinforced Ronald Koeman’s eagerness to bring in new blood during the January transfer window.\n\nKoeman’s side improved in the second period, however, finally summoning the wit to take advantage of the fact Leicester had been forced to deploy a weakened defence because of the bans of Robert Huth and Christian Fuchs. The home team’s replacements were a veteran, the 36‑year‑old centre-back Marcin Wasilewski, and a novice, the 20-year-old Ben Chilwell. The latter performed well but the former’s lack of pace alongside Wes Morgan in central defence was exposed by Everton in the 51st minute.\n\nRonald Koeman: Steve Walsh has Everton set up for transfer window Read more\n\nAll it took was a long punt over the home defence by the visiting goalkeeper, Joel Robles. Kevin Mirallas set off in pursuit of it, easily outrunning the lumbering centre‑backs. Kasper Schmeichel was unable to prevent the Belgian from firing Everton into the lead.\n\nThat was Everton’s first strike on goal in the match. Their only previous attempt in the general direction of the target, a feeble header by Ramiro Funes Mori after a cross by Mirallas, was so inoffensive that most statisticians are unlikely to have recorded it as a shot.\n\nLeicester had gone only a little closer, Daniel Amaratey forcing a routine save from Robles in the 10th minute with a respectable shot from 20 yards after a neat exchange with Shinji Okazaki. There was a grievous lack of creativity from both sides.\n\nRanieri tried to change that at half-time by replacing introducing Danny Drinkwater for Okazaki. After Everton took the lead and began to grow in confidence Ranieri threw on Riyad Mahrez, too. Of his decision to omit from the starting lineup the Premier League player of the year last season, the manager later said: “He’s not in good form and I want to stimulate him. He must give more for the team.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Leicester City fans entertain themselves with Jamie Vardy masks during a turgid first half. Photograph: Mike Egerton/PA\n\nLeicester supporters were also in the mood for telling home truths. They booed Ranieri’s third substitution, not because they had anything against the new arrival, Leonardo Ulloa, but because the man he replaced, Demarai Gray, had been Leicester’s brightest attacker. Ranieri said the switch was made for the sake of team balance. Ulloa’s header within moments of arriving was easily saved by Robles. That was the closest Leicester came to infiltrating Everton’s three-man defence.\n\nEverton controlled the game as it wore on, with Tom Davies a vibrant midfield presence after his introduction midway through the second half.

Given the 13-point gap to Chelsea, who beat Bournemouth, all José Mourinho’s team can do is keep winning, which on Monday they did admirably.\n\nThe United manager said: “I don’t care, honestly. I care about the way we play and I care about our results and to get the maximum points possible and what happens, happens. Last week, Man City against Arsenal, somebody has to lose points and more of those matches will come. We are playing well, we are more confident. The aim is to keep the run going. But it will be a difficult one on Saturday. Middlesbrough lost today against Burnley but they will come here to try.”\n\nUnited dominated the second half and though Moyes would have loved a victory against the club who sacked him two years ago he could have no complaints. He said: “We gave away a dreadful second goal and the third was offside. We hung in. We sort of stifled them, stuck at it and said if we could hold it at 1-0, they might get nervous in the last 10 minutes but we couldn’t do it.”\n\nUnited’s crowning moment came after 81 minutes when Didier N’Dong ceded possession and a composed Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored his 17th goal of the season and his 50th of 2016. This caused Mourinho to stand and offer a salute to fans behind his seat in a signal of particular contentment. Of the Swedish striker’s one-year extension clause in his contract, Mourinho said: “Not yet is it activated but it is activated in his brain and in my decisions and the owners and the board’s.”\n\nBetter was to come in the finishing stakes as an Ibrahimovic cross was met with a sublime back-flip volley from Henrikh Mkhitaryan that sent the home crowd into ecstasy. The Armenian was marginally offside but he hardly cared.\n\n“It’s the best goal I ever scored. I’m very excited,” Mkhitaryan said. “I had a great feeling. I saw that it wasn’t offside and I started to celebrate. I got the ball behind me so the only thing I could do was to hit it with the back heel. I did and I succeeded.”\n\nJosé Mourinho denies he is unhappy to be living in Manchester Read more\n\nMourinho made two changes from the victorious XI at West Brom, with Wayne Rooney and Matteo Darmian making way for Juan Mata and Daley Blind. Rooney missed out because of a minor problem he reported during Christmas Day training. Of the captain being available for the Middlesbrough game on New Year’s Eve, Mourinho said: “I don’t think so. I hope so. He is always a player I would like. It is a strained muscle.”\n\nDonald Love dropped to the bench for Sunderland and the United loanee Adnan Januzaj was ineligible, so Sebastian Larsson and Billy Jones were in the starting line-up.\n\nMoyes’s afternoon began with a hug from the home mascot, Fred the Red, before he stood in the technical area where he saw his former side put together a first move as Marcos Rojo found Ibrahimovic, but his pass to Jesse Lingard was too heavy. This suggested United were in the groove. More smooth passing ensued when Michael Carrick drove the ball to Lingard who laid it off and when possession returned to the former England midfielder his shot was deflected away.\n\nSunderland’s riposte consisted of a corner from the right that caused a moment’s disarray and a Jermain Defoe break that caused deeper consternation. This came after a Phil Jones header towards Jordan Pickford’s goal was cleared upfield. The striker brought the ball down and ran towards David de Gea, but although it came to nothing Mourinho was still upset enough at the manner of the move to yell at his players.\n\nTroy Deeney’s 100th Watford goal denies Sam Allardyce debut Palace win Read more\n\nNext Victor Anichebe charged at Blind who bundled the forward over. Martin Atkinson, the referee, booked the left‑back. From the free-kick Patrick van Aanholt’s effort dipped to De Gea’s right and the goalkeeper tipped away.\n\nThis was now a riveting first half. Antonio Valencia heaved the ball skywards at Mata, who ran into the area. As it dropped Lamine Koné barged him aside for what appeared a fair shout for a penalty but Atkinson waved the appeals away which upset Mourinho.\n\nBlind was the surprise opening scorer. A slick sequence of passing that involved Rojo and Ibrahimovic ended with the Dutchman drilling home a first goal of the season.\n\nUnited set the tone for the second half when Valencia drove along the right and found Ibrahimovic but he misdirected his effort. Minutes later Lingard threaded a pass to Ander Herrera and Sunderland scrambled the ball out for a corner.\n\nUnited pressed and pressed for a second. Mata put Ibrahimovic through but the Swede blasted over, causing Mourinho to hang his head. After 62 minutes United’s manager introduced Mkhitaryan for Lingard with nearly an instant reward. Mata floated the ball over from the right and the forward dropped a shoulder and sent a right-footed attempt narrowly wide. Next in a series of United chances, Mkhitaryan slipped in Ibrahimovic but he only managed to hit Pickford’s legs.\n\nAs the contest entered its final stages Mourinho had made a second substitution – Anthony Martial for Mata. It was a surprise Moyes had made none until the 83rd minute. There might have been some consolation for him when Fabio Borini struck right at the end, but it would have been negligible.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Daley Blind fires Manchester United into a half-time lead.

board who sold their shares in the summer. “We want Bradley out” and “You greedy bastards get out of our club” were among the chants reverberating around the stadium during another chastening defeat for a team who look resigned to relegation.\n\nBob Bradley expects crisis talks after Swansea fans demand his sacking Read more\n\nThe only festive cheer was found in the away end, where the euphoric West Ham fans celebrated a third successive victory that lifted Slaven Bilic’s side up to 11th and piled the misery on to Swansea and their American manager. Bradley put on a brave face and all indications are the Swansea board have no desire to dismiss the man who was appointed in October, yet there is no escaping the level of discontent that was swirling around the Liberty Stadium in the second half.\n\nThe atmosphere felt poisonous and it was not only the hardcore support, in the upper tier of the East Stand, who were calling for Bradley to go. At one point near the end that “We want Bradley out” chant swept around the stadium as fans railed at the sight of their club sliding towards the Championship.\n\nBradley was never a popular choice at the outset and the results since his appointment have done nothing to change opinion. Swansea have picked up only eight points from his 11 games in charge and, most damningly of all, conceded 29 goals. The West Ham defeat was the eighth time under his watch that Swansea have shipped three goals or more in a game.\n\nIt is a woeful record, yet Bradley is not solely responsible for the way that Swansea’s season has unravelled. Their recruitment in the summer was desperately poor and it is tempting to wonder how much better any other manager would do with the group of players Bradley inherited when he replaced Francesco Guidolin.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest André Ayew opens the scoring for West Ham from a yard out against his former club. Photograph: Michael Steele/Getty Images\n\nDefensively Swansea are a shambles. Bradley has tried just about every permutation possible with the back and yet nothing seems to get any better. Some of his tactics in other areas make no sense and it was a curious decision on Bradley’s part to leave out Fernando Llorente, who had scored four goals in his previous two home matches. Borja, the £15.5m club-record signing who has scored only once all season, started in place of Llorente and was dragged off at half-time.\n\nBy that stage Swansea were a goal down after yet another piece of calamitous defending. André Ayew, returning to the club where he finished as top scorer last season, registered his first goal for West Ham with a simple tap-in. Winston Reid added the second early in the second half and it was at that point that the frustration in the stands started to boil over.\n\nArsenal’s Olivier Giroud snatches late win against West Brom Read more\n\nMichail Antonio later added a third and although Llorente pulled one back for Swansea late on, Bilic’s side were not finished. Andy Carroll, volleying home at the far post, twisted the knife with a fourth to re-establish their three‑goal advantage.\n\nSwansea face Bournemouth at home on Saturday, and travel to Crystal Palace three days later. Whether Bradley will still be around for both of those games remains to be seen. Whatever the board thinks privately about wanting to give Bradley more time, the manager’s position will become close to untenable if Swansea lose in front of their own fans against Bournemouth. “In terms of trying to win back a bit of belief from the supporters, Bournemouth couldn’t be bigger,” Bradley said.\n\nFor West Ham, who have collected 10 points from their past four matches, the world seems a much happier place. They brutally exposed Swansea’s defensive frailties and never looked back from the moment Reid headed in Dimitri Payet’s corner five minutes into the second half.\n\nWest Ham’s breakthrough in the first half had owed much to Carroll, who towered above Angel Rangel to head Mark Noble’s diagonal pass back across goal, and also Lukasz Fabianski’s poor goalkeeping. Fabianski carelessly pushed the ball into the path of Ayew, who slotted home from inside the six-yard box.\n\nChelsea’s Pedro torments Bournemouth to stretch league winning run to 12 Read more\n\nAlthough Darren Randolph made a couple of decent saves to deny Gylfi Sigurdsson and Jack Cork, Swansea never threatened to mount a fightback. There is no conviction about their play and it was no surprise when Antonio stabbed home a third, turning in Havard Nordtveit’s wayward shot. Llorente, on for Borja, reduced the deficit when he converted Nathan Dyer’s cross but Carroll put a smile back on Bilic’s face with West Ham’s fourth goal.\n\nNot that the West Ham manager is taking anything for granted. “It would be suicidal to think we are safe now and look only who is above us,” Bilic said. “It is still very tight but we have to use this to gain confidence and continue to improve. Only then we will have a chance to finish good.”"}, {"date": "26/12/2016", "arena": "KCOM Stadium", "attendance": 23134, "home_team": {"name": "Hull City", "lineup": [{"name": "David Marshall", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Maguire", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Dawson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Curtis Davies", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [90], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ahmed Elmohamady", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jake Livermore", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [74]}, {"name": "Tom Huddlestone", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [63]}, {"name": "Samuel Clucas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [78]}, {"name": "Andrew Robertson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robert Snodgrass", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dieumerci Mbokani", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "David Meyler", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shaun Maloney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eldin Jakupovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Weir", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adama Diomande", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [78], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Markus Henriksen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [74], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Mason", "yellows": [82], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [63], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Manchester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Claudio Bravo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bacary Sagna", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nicolás Otamendi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Stones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [18]}, {"name": "Gael Clichy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fernandinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yaya Touré", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [72], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Raheem Sterling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Silva", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [87]}, {"name": "Nolito", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [57]}, {"name": "Kevin De Bruyne", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Pablo Zabaleta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fernando", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [87], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aleksandar Kolarov", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [18], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willy Caballero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jesus Navas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kelechi Iheanacho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [78], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [57], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aleix García Serrano", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "This was a third win in succession for Manchester City and, while not a vintage one, Pep Guardiola will take much solace from his side’s renewed resolve in recent weeks. Yaya Touré and Kelechi Iheanacho were the City names on the scoresheet but the visitors seem mentally reinvigorated and far more assured in the face of direct and physical opponents.\n\nHull certainly provided such a challenge and credit must also go to them after matching their far wealthier adversaries for much of the game. In the end City’s greater quality saw them over the line, a Touré penalty, a fine team move finished by Iheanacho and a late Curtis Davies own-goal ensuring they finished Boxing Day second in the Premier League table.\n\nGiven that Sergio Agüero has been missing since early December and the nature of City’s defeat at Leicester two weeks ago, Guardiola can point to a tangible improvement in his side’s recent performances, even if this was not a classic. Hull battled well but they have now not won in seven league matches.\n\nHull City 0-3 Manchester City: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\n“The first half was quite good in terms of control, except in the last five minutes when we conceded a few stupid fouls and they created some problems with the quality of [Robert] Snodgrass’ set pieces. But we forgot in the first half where the goal was,” Guardiola said.\n\n“Every time Ras [Sterling] had the ball it was pass, pass, pass and we don’t need Ras for the pass we need him for the one-on-one. In the second half he created the penalty, he created the third goal.\n\n“We cannot forget that we’ve played seven games [this season] without Kun [Agüero]. Gabriel Jesus is also coming so we will have two to three strikers with a sense of the goal. It’s so important, especially in games like this.”\n\nJohn Stones returned to the City starting line-up but the defender lasted only 18 minutes before a kick to the knee forced him off, although Guardiola suggested the injury could be serious. Aleksandar Kolarov slotted in at centre-back but neither side produced many moments of fluency during a drab first half.\n\nCity had more of the ball but Hull were relatively solid in defence and limited their opponents to speculative efforts early on. Guardiola had selected a team without a striker once again – with Agüero serving the final match of his four-game suspension – so Kevin De Bruyne, David Silva, Nolito and Raheem Sterling regularly switched positions in a fluid attacking set-up.\n\nBoth teams, though, began the second half with more intent. Sterling had an enticing cross-shot palmed away by David Marshall before Hull started to press. Harry Maguire found himself in an attacking position and crossed from the right to the far post, where Sam Clucas met the ball with a half-volley that was blocked well.\n\nChelsea’s Pedro torments Bournemouth to stretch league winning run to 12 Read more\n\nA swift break from City so nearly resulted in the opening goal in the 53rd minute, De Bruyne eventually receiving the ball down the left before cutting inside and firing a low effort on to Marshall’s right-hand post.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Andrew Robertson brings down Raheem Sterling to give Manchester City the chance to take the lead from the penalty spot. Photograph: Ed Sykes/Reuters\n\nHull then came extremely close themselves. A series of crosses into the box had pinned City in and when Michael Dawson met a high ball with a looping header he seemed to have directed it superbly over City’s goalkeeper, Claudio Bravo, and into the net, only for Bacary Sagna, in a fine position on the line, to clear the danger.\n\nGuardiola sent on Iheanacho in place of Nolito with just over half an hour remaining but it was Sterling who had the decisive impact. After 72 minutes the England forward darted inside from the right and was brought down in the penalty area following a clumsy sliding challenge from Andrew Robertson. There were no complaints from Hull and Touré stepped up to finish emphatically from the spot.\n\nThe second, which killed the game six minutes later, was a fine team move. De Bruyne glided forward, waited calmly before playing a precise pass right to Silva, who then cut an excellent ball across goal for Iheanacho to finish into an empty net.\n\nDavies’ late own-goal – the result of a rapid Sterling break down the left – rubbed salt into Hull’s wounds. Mike Phelan, the Hull manager, said: “It is harsh because a lot of work went into that game from our players today. We suffered through elementary errors which we have to stop doing if we are to progress in this league.\n\n“I thought the way we went about our work today was commendable,” Phelan added. “The critical part is when you make those individual errors and they cost you. But I’m not going to look for a scapegoat. Andy Robertson has been terrific. It’s that youthfulness, maybe immaturity at times at this level. But I think he will come out of it for the better.”"}, {"date": "19/12/2016", "arena": "Goodison Park", "attendance": 39590, "home_team": {"name": "Everton", "lineup": [{"name": "Maarten Stekelenburg", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [64]}, {"name": "Seamus Coleman", "yellows": [69], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Williams", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ramiro Funes Mori", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leighton Baines", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James McCarthy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Idrissa Gueye", "yellows": [85], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Enner Valencia", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [73]}, {"name": "Ross Barkley", "yellows": [68], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Lennon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Romelu Lukaku", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Joel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [64], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin Mirallas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Cleverley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gareth Barry", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dominic Calvert-Lewin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [73], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mason Holgate", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonjoe Kenny", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Liverpool", "lineup": [{"name": "Simon Mignolet", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathaniel Clyne", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dejan Lovren", "yellows": [56], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ragnar Klavan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Milner", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Lallana", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [82]}, {"name": "Jordan Henderson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Georginio Wijnaldum", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sadio Mané", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [90], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Divock Origi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [82]}, {"name": "Roberto Firmino", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Loris Karius", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daniel Sturridge", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [82], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alberto Moreno", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lucas Leiva", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Emre Can", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [82], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Woodburn", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Trent Alexander-Arnold", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Red flares fell from the Bullens Road stand housing Liverpool’s supporters but there was no sign of distress. They were signals of the delight, ecstasy and pandemonium that accompanies a stoppage-time winner in the Merseyside derby and the kind of victory that announces a Premier League title contender with resolve. The distress was everywhere else around Everton’s old stadium.\n\nJürgen Klopp covered his face in disbelief and delight when Sadio Mané reacted quickest to settle the 227th Merseyside derby in the 94th minute. His first visit to Goodison Park had revealed two sides of Liverpool, passive in the face of a high-octane Everton performance in the first half, superior in the second and the team more likely to win a derby high on attrition but low on quality.\n\nWhen the fourth official signalled eight minutes of stoppage time – the consequence of Everton losing their goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg to injury and a Ross Barkley foul on Jordan Henderson that should have resulted in a dismissal – Liverpool sensed opportunity. Everton, without a win in 12 derbies and tiring from their first-half exertions, feared the worst.\n\nThe substitute Daniel Sturridge weaved across the home penalty area and away from an exhausted Leighton Baines. His low shot deflected beyond the reach of the replacement goalkeeper Joel Robles, struck a post and, with Mané far sharper than Ramiro Funes Mori and Ashley Williams, the Senegal international converted from close range to give Klopp a night to savour. He is the first manager in Liverpool’s history to win his first two derbies but moving within six points of the relentless Premier League leaders Chelsea is the statistic that will mean more.\n\nLiverpool showed character plus evidence of strength in depth to recover from a subdued start and claim a victory that means in all competitions they have won as many derbies at Goodison as Everton. There was disruption in defence with Joël Matip again sidelined by an ankle injury but, with Ragnar Klavan dominating Romelu Lukaku, they gained a second successive clean sheet in the Premier League.\n\nKlopp introduced Sturridge, Emre Can and Lucas Leiva from the substitutes’ bench to good effect. Ronald Koeman lost both James McCarthy and Stekelenburg to injury and had to turn to Dominic Calvert-Lewin, a teenager signed from Sheffield United in the summer, when seeking a second-half threat.\n\nThe differences told. The Everton manager admitted Barkley could have seen red for his foul on Henderson but claimed Dejan Lovren should have collected a second yellow card for his part in the mêlée that followed. Koeman’s biggest gripe should have been the complete absence of threat from his team, even when on top in the first half.\n\nEverton started as their manager had requested – for once – showing the intensity and alertness that underpinned their recovery at home to Arsenal last week. Klopp had expected that tempo from his opponents, their desire to widen the play through Séamus Coleman in particular at right-back and willingness to go long to Lukaku, but was visibly enraged within five minutes as training ground plans failed to translate on the pitch. Not that Simon Mignolet was busy in the Liverpool goal other than dealing with a tame second-half header from Williams.\n\nFunes Mori squandered the home side’s best chance when, given a free run and a free header at a Barkley corner shortly before the interval, the Argentina defender steered his effort badly wide. Liverpool had shown nothing of the movement or menace behind their emergence as the Premier League’s leading goalscorers but improved after the half-hour. Their first chance fell to Divock Origi when Georginio Wijnaldum and Nathaniel Clyne combined down the right. Clyne’s centre arrived a fraction behind Origi and, leaning back, he steered a good opportunity high over.\n\nThe usual passion was evident but the derby desperately required a shot on target. Liverpool finally obliged in the 50th minute when they parted Everton’s defence with ease and forced Stekelenburg into the first important stop. James Milner’s first-time ball from the left put Roberto Firmino clean through on goal. Funes Mori resisted temptation to invite another derby dismissal with a professional foul and his keeper rescued Everton, blocking Firmino’s effort with his chest and escaping when Mané and Adam Lallana got in each other’s way as they pursued the rebound.\n\nWhatever Klopp said in the dressing room at half-time made an impact as his team started with the same intensity as Everton had opened the game. The hosts’ midfield balance was disrupted by the loss of McCarthy and their keeper was forced off after being on the receiving end of a vital interception from his own player. A lovely one-two between Mané and Firmino unlocked the home defence but, before the former could convert, Baines slid in to clear and clattered Stekelenburg in the process.\n\nMcCarthy’s replacement, Gareth Barry, teed up Lukaku for a header that sailed over Mignolet’s crossbar but Everton’s quality on the ball deteriorated markedly in the second half. They could easily have been reduced to 10 men for the final 30 minutes when Barkley caught Henderson’s ankle with a dangerous and reckless tackle but the referee, Mike Dean, opted for a lenient yellow. Everton’s punishment would come late and severe, and behind plumes of red smoke Liverpool revelled in a vital result."}, {"date": "18/12/2016", "arena": "Vitality Stadium", "attendance": 11113, "home_team": {"name": "Bournemouth", "lineup": [{"name": "Artur Boruc", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Simon Francis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steve Cook", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathan Aké", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [6], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charlie Daniels", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Wilshere", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Arter", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Smith", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joshua King", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [72]}, {"name": "Marc Pugh", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [55]}, {"name": "Callum Wilson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [64]}], "subs": [{"name": "Dan Gosling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Benik Afobe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [64], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Brad Smith", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Federici", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Fraser", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [55], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tyrone Mings", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordon Ibe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [72], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Southampton", "lineup": [{"name": "Fraser Forster", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cédric Soares", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Maya Yoshida", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Virgil van Dijk", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Bertrand", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [14], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pierre-Emile Højbjerg", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harrison Reed", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Jordy Clasie", "yellows": [76], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathan Redmond", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jay Rodriguez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [48, 85], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Sofiane Boufal", "yellows": [34], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [62]}], "subs": [{"name": "José Fonte", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shane Long", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Davis", "yellows": [78], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dusan Tadic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [62], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cuco Martina", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Ward-Prowse", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stuart Taylor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Claude Puel had promised his Southampton players a mini festive three-day break – and they will be sure to enjoy it after beating their local rivals Bournemouth in only the 24th competitive meeting between the sides. Southampton found their goalscoring touch at just the right time, as Ryan Bertrand and a Jay Rodriguez double hoisted the Saints to seventh in the Premier League. Rodriguez’s second was a peach from outside the box, watched all the way by the Bournemouth manager, Eddie Howe, who coached the striker while at Burnley.\n\nRaheem Sterling completes Manchester City turnaround against Arsenal Read more\n\nNobody is quite sure what moniker to slap on this fixture but it is a south-coast derby to most. Only 28 miles separates Dean Court from St Mary’s and the Bournemouth chairman, Jeff Mostyn, described it as an “appetising lunch” against their neighbours in his programme notes. At full-time Southampton supporters left the ground singing “the south coast is ours”.\n\nPuel said: “The players can now have a fantastic Christmas with their families and their friends. It was important to win and it’s important now to continue this good work. It was an important moment, an important game after just three days’ recovery.”\n\nThe Southampton manager made six changes from his side’s draw at Stoke City in midweek, with the captain, José Fonte, dropping to the bench. One change was enforced, with Oriol Romeu suspended. Shortly after the teams were released, Puel spent 10 minutes in discussion with Fonte on the pitch, perhaps reiterating his rotation policy that resulted in his captain playing no part in their short-lived Europa League campaign. “I think when I saw him [Fonte] after the game he was very happy for the team and for the club,” said Puel, with the smallest of smirks.\n\nBournemouth had started sprightly and raced into a lead inside six minutes while Southampton struggled to dirty their pristine white third kit, making a Premier League debut of its own. A short corner routine allowed Jack Wilshere, again playing in a deeper midfield role, to curl a cross to the back post, where Nathan Aké eluded his marker, Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, and sent a diving header past Fraser Forster. Wilshere’s first assist since joining Bournemouth on a season-long loan from Arsenal could not have come at a better time.\n\nIt was not so long ago that Southampton aided Bournemouth, sending them players on loan and partaking in pre-season friendlies to ease their financial overheads. “Can we have our money back?” sang the visiting supporters. Bournemouth are no longer Southampton’s poor relations, however. Joshua King should have doubled Bournemouth’s lead but his shot was saved by the legs of Forster after the striker easily evaded the attentions of Maya Yoshida.\n\nSouthampton, unusually, looked suspect in defence. Going forward, they had cheer down the left flank where Bertrand, who twice enjoyed loan spells at Bournemouth, frequently found space behind Adam Smith and Simon Francis.\n\nIt was no surprise then when Southampton’s first meaningful attack, which resulted in their equaliser, was started and finished off by Bertrand. The Southampton left-back easily turned Smith before charging past Francis towards the byline and drilling his effort in off the post and past the former Southampton goalkeeper, Artur Boruc.\n\nSouthampton were upstaged by Bournemouth’s sanguine first-half display and Puel changed things at the break. Steven Davis, virtually ever-present for Southampton since joining the club in 2012, replaced Harrison Reed, who was exposed on his first league start of the season.\n\nDavis was quick to make an impact, playing a neat one-two with Sofiane Boufal before crossing low for Rodriguez to tap in his first goal for four months. Boufal’s guile was eventually rewarded but Puel admitted the Moroccan club-record signing is still finding his way in England. Boufal walked into the away dressing room with an oversized scarf on arrival and was later booked for diving by the referee, Mark Clattenburg.\n\nDanny Rose hits superb winner as Tottenham fight back to beat Burnley Read more\n\nAfter taking the lead Southampton seized control while Bournemouth lost their rhythm and suddenly looked devoid of energy, too, persuading Howe to inject the pace of Jordon Ibe and Ryan Fraser, instrumental in Bournemouth’s win against Liverpool. Southampton had scored only 14 league goals before this meeting – as many as the bottom club, Hull City – but found their scoring touch here to secure victory and bragging rights.\n\nRodriguez sealed the three points after 85 minutes and, in the process, Southampton’s first away win in the league since September. Rodriguez struck a sweet shot beyond Boruc – typical of those before he ruptured an anterior cruciate ligament in 2014 – after the ball bounced kindly at the feet of the striker, who excelled under Howe’s guidance at Turf Moor before earning his move to Southampton.\n\n“On a personal level I wish him every success for his future because when he got his injury I think he was on the verge of playing for England and having a really exciting time in his life,” Howe said. “We were looking to keep him quiet but I thought he had a good game and probably deserved the goals.”"}, {"date":

Read more\n\nThe turnaround in the second half was considerable and, by the end, it felt as if City may have reminded everyone they are not out of this title race just yet. “We’ll fight to the end,” used to be the soundtrack here under previous managers and, for the first time perhaps, City showed those qualities of endurance under the new regime.\n\nGuardiola could be seen embracing Yaya Touré, a player he had previously ostracised, and City certainly looked better for their new training routine. They had, according to their manager, devoted two and a half hours of every session purely on winning second balls, a tactic that played its part in their first goal of a hugely satisfying victory.\n\nGuardiola has been subjected to so much scrutiny it is only fair to report that his half-time switch was a prominent factor and – well, whaddya know – he does know what he is doing, after all. It was the fluency of City’s attacking, in particular the interchanging of positions between David Silva, Kevin De Bruyne and the two scorers, Leroy Sané and Raheem Sterling, that wore down their opponents. Each member of that quartet had a go as the team’s most advanced central player. Yet City did not have an orthodox striker, preferring to operate with two men in wide positions and another two in the role of elusive No10s.\n\nIt was a blur of movement and the two passes to set up the goals – one from Silva, one from De Bruyne – felt like a reminder that winning for Guardiola is not enough. He wants to do it with panache, style and supremacy and he could probably be excused that pithy little aside when he was asked about the tactics he had employed to counter Theo Walcott’s early goal. “Now we’ve won the trainer is a genius, right?” Guardiola said. “A genius.”\n\nIn the process, it left Arsenal mulling over back-to-back league defeats for the first time since April 2014, leaving them nine points off Chelsea at the top, with City moving into second position, and Arsène Wenger talking about “a horrible week, absolutely horrible” bearing in mind they had also surrendered a winning position against Everton in their previous match. Wenger was visibly angry with Petr Cech when, in the final seconds of stoppage time, the goalkeeper played a short free-kick rather than aiming it into the opposition penalty area and a distressing afternoon for Arsenal was compounded by Alex Oxlade‑Chamberlain’s hamstring injury, shortly after coming on as a substitute.\n\nOxlade-Chamberlain could not hide his anguish, throwing his shirt towards the dugout before heading straight down the tunnel, whereas Wenger resorted to blaming the match officials, arguing both goals were offside as well as noting: “Referees are protected very well, like lions in a zoo.” A nice line but it could also be said his own team had a few lions during the second half – if we are talking about the variety from The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, in need of some courage.\n\nWenger said his team “dropped physically” in the second half and “maybe we dropped a bit mentally” after Sané’s equaliser two minutes after the restart, and these were not hugely encouraging remarks for a team supposedly harbouring realistic title aspirations. Mesut Özil, Alex Iwobi and Walcott caused considerable problems in the first half but they all tailed off. That, in turn, isolated Alexis Sánchez, whose expertise had sent Walcott running into the penalty area for the opening goal.\n\nAs for the criticism of City’s goals, if Sané was offside it was by the width of a cigarette paper and an argument could be made either way about whether Silva was obscuring Cech’s vision when Sterling let fly with the left-foot shot that beat Arsenal’s goalkeeper at his near post. Yes, Cech would have been aware of Silva’s presence but he still had a clear sighting of the shot.\n\nSterling had started the game in the void left by Sergio Agüero but the experiment seldom worked in the first half, most notably when he flashed a header wide from the kind of opportunity City’s suspended striker would take as a matter of routine. After the break, Sterling switched back to his usual right-sided role and, first, it was Sané’s turn to have a go through the middle. The 20-year-old, signed from Schalke for £37m, has taken his time to show why Guardiola made him one of his priority signings but he had a fine second half, showing great composure for the equalising goal and persistently troubling his opponents thereafter.\n\nArsenal seldom threatened Claudio Bravo’s goal in the last 20 minutes and City duly completed their first win, having been behind at

had put Manchester City 2-1 up against Arsenal in the 71st minute that the White Hart Lane scoreboard coordinator decided it was time for a score-flash from the Etihad Stadium.\n\nTottenham Hotspur had needed a lift. They were the dominant team in this entertaining tussle but it was locked at 1-1 and they were struggling to prise apart Burnley, to create the moment for the knock-out blow. Perhaps the news that their north London neighbours were down might spark them? The home support roared.\n\nRaheem Sterling completes Manchester City turnaround against Arsenal Read more\n\nShortly afterwards, whether by coincidence or not, the game’s outstanding performer, Danny Rose, fashioned the winner. It came with a sledgehammer swing of his left boot after the substitute Moussa Sissoko had put him through on a quick break. Tom Heaton was beaten at his near post but it was no goalkeeping error. The power of the shot was too much.\n\nThe Burnley manager, Sean Dyche, was devastated afterwards and not only because he felt that a gritty and aggressive performance from his team had deserved reward. To him, Sissoko should not have been on the field after he had been guilty of an ugly high kick on Stephen Ward one minute before the goal.\n\nSissoko lunged in on Ward with his studs up as he chased a bouncing ball, and he raked them down the front of the full‑back’s leg. He was only booked. “It was a head-scratcher,” Dyche said. “It was not a close one, it’s a sending-off. You cannot go in blind, with your hands over your face and do a high foot like that, and stay on the pitch.”\n\nDyche said the decision of the referee, Kevin Friend, had been the “sixth game‑changer of the season” against Burnley and he wondered aloud whether the lack of a reaction from Ward had saved Sissoko. Had he writhed about on the floor, Dyche suggested, and his players then moved to surround Friend, perhaps the colour of the card would have been darker. Then again, Dyche said he and the club’s supporters did not want to see their players engaged in what he diplomatically called “simulation”.\n\nJay Rodriguez’s stunning shot seals Southampton victory at Bournemouth Read more\n\nTottenham had most of the game, certainly in terms of shots on goal and the territorial advantage, but Burnley were stubborn opponents who had their moments. Andre Gray, for example, was denied at close range in the early running by Hugo Lloris after Ward had robbed Kyle Walker and crossed. Lloris’s save with his feet was an excellent one.\n\nBurnley’s record on their travels remains dismal but they fashioned a sight for the sorest of eyes midway through the first half – an away goal, only their second of the season. Once again the inroads came up the Tottenham right after Harry Winks had sold Walker short and Scott Arfield nipped in to win possession. His flick hit Winks and broke for George Boyd and when his cross ricocheted off Mousa Dembélé, Ashley Barnes was on hand to poke past Lloris.\n\nFrom a Tottenham point of view it was a mess and Mauricio Pochettino fumed on the touchline. By then his team had created the openings to have “killed the game” in his words, and none of the chances had been clearer than the one that Dele Alli botched in the second minute.\n\nHarry Kane’s pass had set him through on Heaton’s goal, from an angle on the left, but he ballooned the attempted curler high. Kane and Christian Eriksen went close while Alli found the angle was against him after a Victor Wanyama headed flick. There had also been pain for Alli after Matthew Lowton caught him with a nasty tackle. The Burnley full-back was not booked for that one.\n\nSpurs found a swift response to Barnes’s goal and it came from Alli. Wanyama rolled the ball wide to Walker and, from his low cross, Alli darted across some static Burnley defending to sidefoot low into the near corner.\n\nTottenham pressed on to the front foot, with Walker and Rose catching the eye with their forward thrusts from the full‑back positions. Pochettino said Rose’s performance had been arguably his best of the manager’s time at the club.\n\nThe soundtrack to the game was provided by the guttural noises from Pochettino and Dyche in the technical areas, which threatened to summon previously unsighted wildlife to N17. Who knew what either manager was barking but the sense of urgency was palpable.\n\nDyche was beside himself at a number of Friend’s decisions and there was also the moment on 54 minutes when Eric Dier lunged into a penalty-box challenge on Gray. Dier just about got a piece of the ball, together with other bits of the Burnley striker. “I thought that was a good foot in,” Dyche said.\n\nSpurs, who missed Toby Alderweireld because of a back spasm, threatened but without creating too much of clear-cut note. Kane had worked Heaton from Alli’s lovely through-ball in the 42nd minute while, in the second half, Eriksen headed at Heaton after good work from Rose; Alli curled narrowly wide and Eriksen was again denied by Heaton.

They are steeled by an air of invincibility at present.\n\nAlan Pardew, head bowed almost in resignation as he trudged down the touchline at the final whistle, will have taken no pleasure in being proved right with his pre-match assessment that these opponents can appear unbeatable. Here they proved impenetrable. What was impressive was the visitors’ ability to scrap for the points, beating the hosts at their own game while forever retaining that lively threat on the counterattack and feverishly suffocating Palace’s attempts at revival.

That sequence of victories has included nine clean sheets. The rest of the division may have forgotten how to defend, but Chelsea under Conte continue to prove it is an art form.\n\n“Starting this season, I said the manager must be a tailor and try and find the right fit for the team,” he said, resisting the temptation to name the club’s “fashion partners” in his metaphor. “For sure, it wasn’t easy for me to arrive here and understand very quickly the characteristics of my players. I needed a bit of time.\n\n“I tried a different solution before changing the formation, but the most important thing is the mentality, our strong mentality. That and hard work during the week: tactical work, physical work, analysis work, diet ... we touched different aspects to try and improve.\n\n“You can bring your idea of football with you, but if you don’t have players who follow you it doesn’t matter.”\n\nAntonio Conte wants ‘special future’ after Chelsea beat Crystal Palace Read more\n\nHis players needed some convincing at first but have now bought into his methods, convinced as soon as the defence was tightened up and the results began to flow. There are no doubters in the ranks these days.\n\nBournemouth on Boxing Day will provide their own test now that Diego Costa and N’Golo Kanté have succumbed to their fifth cautions of term to grant them Christmas off. They have been integral to this team’s sprint clear of the pack and will be missed. Kanté was as busy as ever in central midfield, denying Palace time to settle, and it was Costa who secured the points.\n\nThere was a simplicity to his 50th goal for Chelsea that rather damned the home side’s attempt at defence. Eden Hazard had retreated into midfield in possession before urging the outstanding César Azpilicueta up from centre-half duties on the opposite flank. The Spaniard ambled forward untracked and lofted a centre towards the far post where Costa, finding space away from Scott Dann and Martin Kelly, was permitted a free header that he eased over Wayne Hennessey. The goalkeeper was poorly positioned, caught between a desire to intercept the cross or defend his line. The concession felt soft.\n\n“We didn’t get enough pressure on the centre-half, but then again you don’t expect him to the centre-forward with a pass of that quality” said Pardew. “Azpilicueta’s was the perfect pass. But my team tried everything. We threw everything we could at them, but they were just too good defensively for us.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Victor Moses fouls Jason Puncheon. Photograph: Dan Mullan/Getty Images\n\nJason Puncheon and James McArthur missed the home side’s best opportunities, but the more presentable opportunities were passed up by the visitors on the break. Hennessey did well to deny Kanté and Marcos Alonso, with the Spaniard curling a late free-kick on to the underside of the crossbar. The margin of their victory probably should have been greater.\n\nThat left Palace deflated as they contemplated an eighth defeat in 10 league games and a 22nd of the calendar year. Pardew knows his position is under scrutiny, but if the board are unlikely to act after successive narrow home defeats to Manchester United and Chelsea this team cannot contemplate succumbing at Vicarage Road on Boxing Day. Or, even more critically, at home to Swansea City in the new year.\n\n“The positives are there for everyone to see,” said Dann. “We came up against a top team, a side who are top of the league, and we deserved to get something out of the game. We showed togetherness and commitment and if we continue that we will start picking up points.”\n\nThat needs to happen sooner rather than later or Pardew, with Sam Allardyce waiting in the wings, will find his time is up. Palace have had a wretched 12 months. Chelsea’s, in contrast, has been an untouchable 11 matches. The Premier League record of 14 is looming ever larger and could be equalled at White Hart Lane next month.

"report": "Bob Bradley has no intention of considering his position despite a 3-0 defeat at Middlesbrough, which will leave his side second-bottom of the Premier League at Christmas.\n\nTwo first-half goals from Álvaro Negredo and a 58th-minute effort from Marten de Roon boosted Boro’s survival chances and left Swansea reeling from a second straight defeat after the 3-1 loss at West Bromwich Albion.\n\nSome among Swansea’s small travelling contingent made their anger plain towards the end of the game, but Bradley is adamant two upcoming home games can give him the chance to turn his side’s season around.\n\n“I go in motivated every day and I’ve said many times I like the group of players, I love the club and now it’s a challenge,” he said. “When I came here, I knew what I was getting into and I’m not backing down from it now.\n\n“That’s the challenge – when the team has put itself in a tough spot everybody has got to stick together during the toughest times and fight the fight.\n\n“I put pressure on myself to see if we can make the team stronger and fight for points every week, and I will continue to do that.”\n\nBradley was particularly disappointed that Swansea failed to heed his call for resilience after their defeat at The Hawthorns.\n\nDespite a bright start, in which Modou Barrow and Gylfi Sigurdsson missed chances, Negredo’s swinging opener changed the momentum of the game and, from then on, there seemed little chance of a Swansea recovery.\n\n“We have to look at ourselves and it’s the same story – we started OK, we felt the energy and confidence, but on their first real look at goal we went down,” Bradley said.\n\n“We talked about our ability to hold things together, but their second goal came after a strange mix-up over whose throw it was – the next thing it’s a penalty and we have put ourselves in a big hole.\n\n“For the first time we didn’t take care of business against a team that is right around us in the table. Now we have got to look at our next two home matches because winning home matches in this battle is going to be the real key.”\n\nMark Noble penalty earns West Ham fortunate win over dominant Hull Read more\n\nBradley’s team were second best throughout, giving Negredo space in the box to open the scoring in the 18th minute before Jordi Amat tripped Adam Forshaw to set up Negredo’s second from the spot.\n\nBustling Middlesbrough got the third they deserved just before the hour mark when De Roon converted a cross from Negredo, and they could have made it four late on when the returning George Friend went forward only to fire high and wide.\n\nSwansea belatedly pressed, with Sigurdsson firing over the bar and a strong effort from the substitute Leroy Fer blocked in a crowded box. Their hopes of a consolation were dashed when Víctor Valdés saved well from Fernando Llorente late on.\n\nEven so, Aitor Karanka pronounced himself far from pleased with Middlesbrough’s performance, but admitted the three points could prove vital in their survival fight.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Another long afternoon for Bob Bradley. Photograph: Jason Cairnduff/Reuters\n\n“Until we scored the first goal I was really upset [with the performance], but sometimes you have to understand the players and, for them, it was a game with a lot of pressure,” he said.\n\n“It was really difficult at the beginning of the game, but after the game it has been a massive win against a direct opponent. The main thing is to have the points on the table.\n\n“There are some games we will win playing not as good as we would like to play, and some we will lose playing our best, because we are in the Premier League and every single point is difficult.”\n\nKaranka dedicated his side’s win to the goalkeeping coach Leo Percovich, who will require an operation next week after snapping his achilles tendon at the training ground on Friday.\n\n“Leo has been very important because you have seen him on the bench and he is a character in the changing room,” the manager said. “The players know how big and important Leo is, and I know he will be at home cheering for us.”"}, {"date": "17/12/2016", "arena": "Bet365 Stadium", "attendance": 27663, "home_team": {"name": "Stoke City", "lineup": [{"name":

Leicester City recovered from anger and disarray to salvage a draw that they celebrated like a victory. Two-goals down and destabilised by a sense of persecution following the first-half dismissal of Jamie Vardy and the award of a penalty against Danny Simpson, the champions stormed back and equalised with two minutes to go in normal time.\n\nThe thrilling 4-2 victory over Manchester City last Saturday did not prove to be a turning point in their Premier League campaign, but maybe this will.\n\nWhat is certain is that Leicester will face disciplinary proceedings after they were shown six yellow cards in addition to Vardy’s red and the most extraordinary sight on a wild afternoon was of Kasper Schmeichel ushering the normally placid Claudio Ranieri away from the referee, Craig Pawson, at half-time.\n\nThe Italian said that his representations to Pawson – and his subsequent gestures to the Leicester fans – were intended to defuse tension or at least turn it into positive energy. The authorities will probably invite him to elaborate on that.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jamie Vardy is shown the red card by Craig Pawson in the first half for a tackle on Mame Biram Diouf. Photograph: Anthony Devlin/Reuters\n\nWhatever appears on their rap sheet, Leicester’s away record remains awful. This was their second point on their travels this season, but the context in which it was gained could make it worth more. For a while they had seemed on course for a heavy beating and a full-blown meltdown.\n\nLeicester’s woe began in the 28th minute when Vardy was sent off for a tackle on Mame Biram Diouf that Pawson deemed to be dangerous. The striker lifted both feet off the ground as he dived for the ball in his own half but he had landed by the time he connected with it. Pawson, who had been criticised in midweek for failing to punish Manchester United’s Marcos Rojo for a two-footed lunge at Crystal Palace’s Wilfried Zaha, ruled it to have been reckless.\n\nThere were suggestions that Vardy had been unbalanced by Glen Johnson as he went into the challenge, something the Stoke manager, Mark Hughes, referred to. “People are trying to say he was pushed and that’s the reason he jumped in with two feet off the ground,” he said. “It looked to me like he had two straight legs and out of control.\n\n“There have been a couple of incidents like that where players have done similar and got away with yellows but those were deemed to be wrong, so the referee got it right.”\n\nLeicester’s rage intensified 11 minutes later when Stoke were given a penalty after a cross by Bojan Krkic hit the outstretched arm of Simpson as the defender, two yards away from the crosser, tried to make a block. Deliberate? No. Careless? Debatable. Krkic capitalised from the spot.\n\nLeicester lost their cool after that and it looked like they would be lucky to end the match with 10 players on the pitch. Three of their players were booked for dissent.\n\nMiddlesbrough add to Swansea City’s woes as Álvaro Negredo hits double Read more\n\nTo compound Leicester’s grievance, fortune turned against them. Stoke doubled their lead just before half-time when Johnson rolled a free-kick to Giannelli Imbula, whose shot struck the inside of the post, bounced off Schmeichel’s back and to the feet of Joe Allen, who stroked the ball into the empty net.\n\nSchmeichel’s return to action after a six-week lay-off was supposed to herald an upturn in Leicester’s fortunes. The Dane had reinforced that theory by making a superb save from a shot by Jonathan Walters in the fifth minute. That was the trigger for tit-for-tat attacking in which Leicester gave as good as they got– until the loss of Vardy.\n\nThe England striker would have at least departed as a goalscorer if he had taken the chance given to him in the seventh minute by Marc Albrighton. But the striker hooked his lob wide. Lee Grant then had to make a save from a shot by Slimani, who forced him into another stop in the 23rd minute after nicking the ball off Ryan Shawcross. Two minutes later Grant intervened again, this time foiling Vardy after a cute set-up by Riyad Mahrez. Moments later Vardy jumped into the tackle on Diouf and was ordered off by Pawson. Then Leicester started to unravel.\n\nClaudio Ranieri denies stoking Leicester fans’ anger towards referee Read more\n\nIt seemed that the visitors composed themselves at half-time because they emerged with fresh focus. But balancing the scores would be tougher. Schmeichel had to make a fine save to prevent Stoke from going three up, tipping over a header by Jonathan Walters.\n\nRanieri’s next significant intervention was to make a double substitution in the 72nd minute and the new arrivals combined to revive hope for the champions. Demarai Gray delivered a cross from the right and Leonardo Ulloa sent a powerful header past Lee Grant. Ryan Shawcross thought he had cleared it off the line, but technology determined otherwise. Pawson, no doubt grateful for the help, awarded the goal.\n\nTwo minutes from time, Leicester’s turnaround was complete as Christian Fuchs swung a ball into the box and Daniel Amartey powered a header into the net from eight yards.

dizzy heights of 18th. Significantly, it also spares Wearsiders the psychological burden of being bottom at Christmas.\n\n“We’re still in touch,” said Sunderland’s manager. “It’s an important win. We gave away a lot of stupid free-kicks and were lucky not to be behind before Patrick scored but we also showed some steel. We’ve got a good siege mentality.”\n\nAt the end of a week when Moyes made it crystal clear that he feels badly let down by the failure of Ellis Short, the club’s owner, to honour perceived assurances regarding proposed January investment, this represented a most welcome boost.\n\nJamie Vardy in red card controversy as 10-man Leicester battle back to draw Read more\n\nIt also left Watford ruing a litany of spurned chances on a day when they appeared well capable of subjecting Sunderland to further pain but were, instead, repeatedly thwarted by an amalgam of sub-standard final balls and Jordan Pickford.\n\nThe England under-21 goalkeeper quickly emphasised his authority with a stunning diversion of Nordin Amrabat’s volley that was bound for the top corner after an Étienne Capoue corner won in the wake of Odion Ighalo’s defence-bisecting advance. Pickford is excellent with his feet as well as his hands, and it would not be too much of a surprise were Pep Guardiola to try to buy him next month.\n\nFor the moment, though, he remains a vital element of Sunderland’s survival bid and offered much-needed reassurance as Watford initially destabilised Lamine Koné and/or Papy Djilobodji almost every time they attacked, with Ighalo, in particular, unnerving the home backline.\n\nEven so, Watford should have taken the lead when Miguel Britos connected with a José Holebas free-kick but somehow headed wide from point-blank range. “We cannot miss all these chances,” said a disbelieving Walter Mazzarri. “If you miss them all you get punished.”\n\nHaving switched to 4-2-3-1 from the reasonably resilient 3-4-3 formation deployed during Wednesday’s 1-0 home defeat by Chelsea, Sunderland looked distinctly vulnerable until Victor Anichebe began worrying Watford, making all the second-half difference.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Miguel Britos climbs highest but sees his header slip past the post. Photograph: Andrew Yates/Reuters\n\nIndeed, Christian Kabasele, on for the injured Sebastian Prödl, found Anichebe so irritating he attempted to get him sent off by collapsing clutching his face after the pair challenged for the ball. Admittedly, the Nigerian flung out an arm during their tussle but it made contact at chest rather than chin level and Anichebe merely received a talking-to.\n\nRoused by the crowd’s indignation, Sunderland finally placed Watford under pressure with an arguably offside Van Aanholt seeing a shot blocked by Heurelho Gomes, the hitherto underworked goalkeeper.\n\nMiddlesbrough add to Swansea City’s woes as Álvaro Negredo hits double Read more\n\nThe mood had turned distinctly edgy by the time the same player gave Sunderland a 49th-minute lead with his, and the team’s, second real chance. Created by Adnan Januzaj’s high-calibre through pass and Jermain Defoe’s cross, it featured Van Aanholt swivelling sharply and scoring after Kabasele partially blocked his initial effort.\n\nInstantly, Sunderland looked transformed. Newly resolute in defence, they took turns to stretch their former team-mate Younès Kaboul and friends in Mazzarri’s back three. If Ighalo had provoked first-half panic, Anichebe was now firmly centre-stage and curled a shot marginally wide with Gomes beaten after being adroitly cued up by Defoe.\n\nWith Watford waking up again, the unmarked Troy Deeney stuck on 99 club goals headed Amrabat’s cross narrowly wide while Pickford subsequently saved smartly from Ighalo and Daryl Janmaat.\n\nTellingly, at the final whistle,

result that leaves Mike Phelan’s side bottom of the Premier League at Christmas.\n\nThere was something inevitable about the result: a classic case of footballing sod’s law. Hull hit the post three times, squandered two one-on-ones and generally saw their positive, well-drilled endeavours founder at the final hurdle. West Ham were largely disjointed even after changing shape and personnel at half-time, but earned a soft penalty when Tom Huddlestone pulled Michail Antonio down and now have seven points in a week.\n\n“Were we lucky? Yes,” said Slaven Bilic. “For a long period of the game it looked like they deserved something. Through the first half, even to 60 minutes. Our start wasn’t good enough.\n\nWest Ham’s on-loan striker Simone Zaza set to return to Juventus Read more\n\n“In the last half hour we had good composure, good balance in the team. We built pressure and from the pressure we got the penalty. I would like and love that we’d played better but we knew these two games [with Burnley in midweek] were all about the results. We got six points out of the games, the main object for us.”\n\nFor Phelan, there was little comfort from what he felt was his side’s best performance of the season. “The game should have been out of sight before the penalty,” the Hull manager said. “Everything that could have gone against us did.\n\n“I should believe, being in charge of this group, that performances like that will eventually bring results. But you have to be clinical, you have to be ruthless. Teams in the past have come into the Premier League – a few spring to mind – and have been very good at attacking games, but have got relegated.”\n\nRobert Snodgrass had already scuffed his shot with only Darren Randolph to beat before Dieumerci Mbokani was presented with the game’s best opportunity in the 21st minute. Aaron Cresswell underhit a blind back pass into the path of Hull’s Congolese striker who intercepted the ball and dinked it over the advancing Randolph. He then watched helplessly as the ball hit the near post, bounced along the line and then out again.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Hull’s Dieumerci Mbokani sees a golden opportunity go begging.

A powerful Andrew Robertson cross was turned on to his own post by Mark Noble’s diving header. Two minutes later Robertson’s 20-yard shot cannoned off the other post. Maguire had another header cleared off the line, Angelo Ogbonna made a last-ditch tackle to deny Clucas and Snodgrass landed a 25-yard curler on the roof of the net.\n\nWest Ham did have the ball cleared off the Hull line, André Ayew’s header meeting Robertson’s right boot.\n\nThe penalty came in the 76th minute, converted nervelessly by Noble for his second goal in two matches. After that, Hull wilted and West Ham came alive.\n\nBilic hopes that back-to-back wins will finally ease the mental pressure on his side, who face Swansea next. For Phelan it is a case of hoping that luck will change and that reinforcements will arrive and make the difference in January.\n\n“It’s hard. Even some clubs at the top are wanting that player who will change their fortunes,” Phelan said. “We’re at the other end of the table and have to advertise ourselves to players who have got grit, determination, courage to battle it out.

With another two goals, the Swede took his tally for the season to 16 – and 10 in his last nine games – to complete a highly satisfactory week for José Mourinho and his players.\n\nUnited have won three times in the space of seven days – their first such run in the Premier League since August – and there are clear signs that the juggernaut is starting to pick up a little speed. Ibrahimovic is certainly in the groove, playing like a man at the peak of his powers rather than a 35-year-old in the twilight of his career.\n\nHis early header set United on their way before anyone had a chance to break sweat and the match was in effect over as a contest when Ibrahimovic added a second early in the second half. West Bromwich Albion’s self-belief was broken and United were able to cruise towards a routine victory that lifts them to within three points of fourth-placed Manchester City, albeit having played a game more.\n\nWest Brom v Manchester United: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nWith home fixtures to come against Sunderland and Middlesbrough, the league table could make for even better reading for United by the time the year comes to a close. They are not playing vintage attacking football by any stretch, yet United are finding a way to win matches and producing flashes of brilliance, with the lovely opening goal against Albion a case in point.\n\nBy the end it felt like Christmas had come early for the travelling supporters as Rooney, Paul Pogba and Ander Herrera led a group of United players over towards them to throw their shirts into the crowd. “I told them to do that,” Mourinho said. “It’s Christmas time. A shirt for a fan, coming direct from the game with sweat, means a lot. For the players, it’s just one more shirt. But I think for the fans it means a lot.”\n\nWith Albion flying high in seventh place and awkward opponents for any team on paper, Mourinho was entitled to be delighted with the outcome and the Portuguese quickly made it clear that he had no intention of overshadowing the result by saying anything controversial in relation to either of the two major flashpoints.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Zlatan Ibrahimovic scores his second goal of the match. Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian\n\nThe first incident featured Ibrahimovic, who poleaxed Craig Dawson with a challenge that was late and potentially dangerous as the United striker knocked the Albion full-back to the floor. Ibrahimovic never had any chance of getting the ball and it felt like one of those fouls that merits more than a booking but perhaps not quite a red card. Anthony Taylor, the referee, arrived at that conclusion and decided to show only a yellow card.\n\nAsked about that moment, Mourinho turned the conversation to the other controversial incident, when Salomón Rondón slapped Marcos Rojo in the face after the two squared up to each other in the second half. Rondón seemed to be reacting to something that Rojo said, yet the Venezuelan was playing with fire by raising his hand, even if the contact was barely hard enough to burst a paper bag. Mourinho, in fairness, felt the referee did the right thing by allowing Rondón to stay on the pitch.\n\nTony Pulis did not seem quite so impressed with the way that Taylor handled the game. Asked about Ibrahimovic’s actions, Pulis said: “Ask the 28,000 supporters what they thought.“ The Albion manager also described Ibrahimovic’s challenge as “worse than the [Rondón] one”.\n\nEither way, there can be no doubting Ibrahimovic’s ability and his influence over this United team. “I’m so pleased for him,” Mourinho said. “He is the kind of player who doesn’t need to prove anything to anyone. But when he decided to come to England for the last period of his career – to the most difficult championship in the world – I think he proved he is a superman in his mentality. What he is doing at 35 is a dream for every striker of 25 in the Premier League.”\n\nPatrick van Aanholt lifts Sunderland with vital win over Watford Read more\n\nIt was certainly a wonderful goal that Ibrahimovic finished off to put United ahead in the fifth minute. Pogba and Antonio Valencia were involved in the buildup, yet ultimately it was all about the timing of Jesse Lingard’s run and the outstanding technique that the England international showed to deliver an inch-perfect cross, on the half-volley, for Ibrahimovic to nod beyond Ben Foster.\n\nChances then came and went at both ends. Rooney, set up by Lingard, saw his 18-yard shot superbly tipped on to the crossbar by Foster. At the other end of the pitch, Rondón should have done better when he got in between Phil Jones and Rojo only to head Matty Phillips’s cross well wide.\n\nMourinho was frustrated that Lingard wasted an opportunity to double United’s lead on the stroke of half-time, when the winger snatched at a ball that dropped invitingly for him following Matteo Darmian’s miskick, yet the visitors took little time to score a second after the restart.\n\nPicking up possession from Rooney, Ibrahimovic stepped inside Gareth McAuley far too easily and struck a low right-foot shot that took a deflection off Craig Dawson before nestling in the far corner. Albion, in truth, never looked like getting back in the game. “That second goal took the wind out of us,” Pulis admitted."}, {"date": "14/12/2016", "arena": "Riverside Stadium", "attendance": 32704, "home_team": {"name": "Middlesbrough", "lineup": [{"name": "Victor Valdes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Antonio Barragan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Calum Chambers", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Gibson", "yellows": [69], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fabio Da Silva", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Forshaw", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Clayton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [56]}, {"name": "Marten de Roon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adama Traore", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Álvaro Negredo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [77]}, {"name": "Viktor Fischer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [56]}], "subs": [{"name": "Bernardo Espinosa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Grant Leadbitter", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [56], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordan Rhodes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [77], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Brad Guzan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stewart Downing", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [56], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Emilio Nsue", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Nugent", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Liverpool", "lineup": [{"name": "Simon Mignolet", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathaniel Clyne", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dejan Lovren", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ragnar Klavan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Milner", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Lallana", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [29, 68], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [82]}, {"name": "Jordan Henderson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Georginio Wijnaldum", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [87]}, {"name": "Sadio Mané", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Divock Origi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [60], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Roberto Firmino", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Loris Karius", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alberto Moreno", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lucas Leiva", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [82], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin Stewart", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Oviemuno Ejaria", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [87], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Woodburn", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Trent Alexander-Arnold", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "The cameras attempted to pan towards Liverpool’s dropped goalkeeper on more than one occasion here but no one was really noticing. Jürgen Klopp’s side made sure that Loris Karius was not the story on a night when Adam Lallana starred in a convincing victory and they played the kind of scintillating football that has become their trademark this season.\n\nSimon Mignolet replaced Karius after his recent errors but the saga that dominated the build-up to this game was soon forgotten. Liverpool started steadily after dropping points in their last two games but when they hit their stride Middlesbrough were simply no match. If the hosts’ manager, Aitor Karanka, was being brutally honest a three-goal defeat was probably not the worst result.\n\nTwo-goal Christian Eriksen inspires Tottenham to victory over Hull City Read more\n\nEach goal was the result of sharp team interplay and Lallana’s fine campaign continues. He opened the scoring with a header, set up Divock Origi for the second and made the points secure with a brilliant third, as Liverpool went above Arsenal in the Premier League to second place.\n\nKarius watched from the bench as Liverpool controlled the tempo throughout. Klopp said afterwards that the German would not be restored to the starting XI immediately and that Mignolet –who had little to do on Teesside – would keep his place for the foreseeable future.\n\n“I’m not interested in public pressure, I’m interested in the boy and there’s no reason to push him through this situation,” said Klopp of the decision to drop Karius. “At the end they were little mistakes and they can happen. There is no reason to push him [Karius] through this situation, especially when you have a goalkeeper like Simon Mignolet.”\n\nAsked how Karius took the news, Klopp added: “How you can imagine. It was not that he immediately wanted a hug, but it’s normal. It’s football. It’s all OK but of course for the player it was not the best moment in life. Now it’s Simon’s chance.”\n\nMignolet therefore started a Premier League match for the first time since mid-September. The Belgian spooned a clearance high early on but was relatively assured during a half in which Liverpool had the edge.\n\nAfter a tight opening 20 minutes when the only effort on target was a 25-yard strike from Middlesbrough’s left-back, Fábio, Klopp’s side began to take control. They had pressed and dominated possession without creating too much, until a fine team move gave them the lead.\n\nIn the 29th minute Georginio Wijnaldum played a fizzing ball out right to Nathaniel Clyne, who ran on to the pass with pace and made room to cross deep. Lallana timed his run well in the penalty area and rose superbly to nod Clyne’s accurate ball past Víctor Valdés and in at the far post.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Adam Lallana heads home the opening goal of the game. Photograph: Richard Sellers/PA\n\nIt was the kind of team goal that Liverpool have become accustomed to producing this season, and the lead was one that they probably deserved. Middlesbrough almost responded immediately, Viktor Fischer forcing a smart stop from Mignolet at the near post, yet it was Liverpool who came closest to another before half-time through Sadio Mané, who struck a post after being sent through by Origi.\n\nMiddlesbrough were on the back foot immediately in the second half and Klopp praised his side’s slick attacking. He said: “It’s not the first time this season. The boys are capable of doing things like this, it is really good. The third goal, it’s perfect. It looks simple but it isn’t. It was a good game tonight. I wouldn’t have expected it but the reaction was great.”\n\nLiverpool were well on top and Mané , in particular, was in the thick of it. In the 55th minute the away supporters appealed for handball against Calum Chambers after Mané’s shot from Roberto Firmino’s low cross, but although the ball appeared to strike an arm it was tucked into Chambers’ body.\n\nSoon, though, those supporters were celebrating a second and once again it was a fine team move with Lallana at its heart. The midfield interplay was simply too good for Middlesbrough and by the time Wijnaldum slipped the ball through to Lallana, the red and white Boro shirts were spinning. Lallana raced to the by-line and pulled it across for Origi who finished coolly from close range.\n\nKaranka had already tried to stem the tide by bringing on Stewart Downing and Grant Leadbitter, but his team were being comprehensively outplayed and the game was done soon enough. This time Origi was the provider and Lallana the scorer, his sixth of the season from another fine move in the 68th minute that had similarities to Liverpool’s second. Origi raced on to a loose ball and as Firmino made the decoy run to the near post, Origi pulled it back to the far instead where Lallana finished emphatically.\n\n“We’ve lost against one of the best teams that we’ve played so far this season,” said Karanka. “When teams like them play at that level it’s difficult.

If so, Chelsea are showing every indication of possessing sufficient ruthless consistency to achieve it this season, with the latest, fairly compelling, evidence arriving at Sunderland’s expense.\n\nA 10th straight Premier League win left Antonio Conte’s team six points clear at the top of the table on a night when Cesc Fàbregas not only scored the winning goal but, courtesy of a high-calibre central-midfield performance, reminded everyone of his enduring importance in west London.\n\nStarting his third League game of the campaign, Fàbregas also helped keep the home side stuck firmly to the bottom of the division with their horizon looking increasingly bleak. Despite restricting Chelsea to that single goal, Sunderland created precious little of note until stoppage-time when Thibaut Courtois’s brilliant diversion of Patrick van Aanholt’s volley came between Conte and a technical area meltdown.\n\n“I’m pleased for sure,” said Chelsea’s manager. “It’s not easy to win 10 games in a row in this league and we had to fight to win this one. We couldn’t quite kill it and, at the end, Sunderland had a big chance to equalise.”\n\nAfter joking about his decision in selecting the “very good” Fàbregas, Conte stressed there can be no room for complacency. “Me and my players are doing something important,” he said. “But this league is very tough – the title is between six teams.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Thibaut Courtois makes a stunning last-gasp save as Chelsea held on for a 10th league win in a row Photograph: Lee Smith/Reuters\n\nDavid Moyes has never championed three at the back and points out that serious prizes are rarely won by sides configured with central-defensive trinities. There are exceptions to every rule though and, here, Sunderland’s manager arranged his team in a 3-4-3 formation, mirroring Chelsea’s system.\n\nMaybe the full moon high in the Wearside sky prompted such boldness, perhaps imitation really is the sincerest form of flattery or possibly matching your opponents’ shape is the latest tactical fad. Whatever the reason, John O’Shea mirrored the David Luiz sweeping role as Sunderland started quite securely, if a little cagily, in a new design well suited to Billy Jones and Van Aanholt, their wing-backs. Chelsea enjoyed more possession but they initially struggled to trouble Jordan Pickford.\n\nChange beckoned when, for once, Diego Costa escaped the attentions of O’Shea, Lamine Koné and the former Chelsea centre-half Papy Djilobodji. Unmarked, the centre-forward connected with a cross from Marcos Alonso, a one-time Sunderland loanee, but failed to get a proper purchase and sliced wide.\n\nAdam Lallana scores twice to ease Liverpool to victory over Middlesbrough Read more\n\nIt was a warning Sunderland failed to heed as they permitted N’Golo Kanté to seize possession deep in midfield. That interception prefaced Fàbregas and Willian – deputising for the injured Eden Hazard – exchanging passes. By shaping to shoot but, instead, squaring, Willian deceived a backline that proved powerless to prevent Fàbregas sweeping the ball imperiously past Pickford into the bottom right corner from the edge of the area.\n\nMoyes’s gameplan of sitting back and hoping to snatch something on the break shattered instantly and the resultant frustration seemed manifested by swift bookings for Jermain Defoe and O’Shea for fouls on Fàbregas and Costa. Indeed, with a Willian free-kick whizzing fractionally off target half-time could not come quickly enough for the home side.\n\nThey emerged apparently galvanised and, almost immediately, nearly scored with their first real chance. Catching Chelsea in momentarily dozy mode, Defoe played in the overlapping Adnan Januzaj whose fine, first-time, shot forced the previously marginalised Courtois into a superb diving save.\n\nSuitably stung, the visiting riposte proved rapid and vicious. Willian delighted in dodging Koné in a manner that made a mockery of the £25m release clause contained in the defender’s contract and his ensuing shot brushed the bar after deflecting off Djilobodji. Pickford barely had time to sigh with relief before ably repelling Costa’s low angled shot.\n\nMark Noble counts his spot luck as West Ham see off bullish Burnley Read more\n\nVictor Moses bewildered Sebastian Larsson before shooting left-footed and narrowly wide in an on-going onslaught also featuring Willian missing the target after collecting David Luiz’s typically elegant pass.\n\nFàbregas, meanwhile, delighted in showing off his stellar passing range with one particularly exquisite delivery almost prompting a goal for Willian before a volley of his own swerved off target.\n\nSuch near misses almost proved extremely costly when, in stoppage time, Van Aanholt unleashed a spectacular volley destined for the top corner until Courtois’s stunning, win-preserving, intervention. “I thought it was in,” said Moyes. “But he made a top save.”"}, {"date": "14/12/2016", "arena": "London Stadium", "attendance": 56990, "home_team": {"name": "West Ham United", "lineup": [{"name": "Darren

spring back in the second.\n\nZlatan Ibrahimovic late goal gives Manchester United win at Crystal Palace Read more\n\n“It’s a very important and a very hard-fought three points,” Bilic said after the match. “It was a very long game. I think we deserved it. There were two different halves. In the first it was all us, we hit the post twice and we had many shots. Not many clear-cut chances but we controlled the game. We had two penalty appeals, one was given, and I think we should have been two up.”\n\nHis summary was spot on. West Ham recorded 72% possession in the first half but, even with Andy Carroll restored to the starting lineup, failed to open up a resolute Burnley backline. That was not necessarily a disaster for a team with West Ham’s skill set, however, so well stocked are they with long-range shooters, and both Pedro Obiang and Noble duly hit the woodwork from distance before half-time.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Darren Randolph stretches to deny Burnley, who put the hosts under pressure in the second half. Photograph: TGSPhoto/REX/Shutterstock\n\nThe goal came in injury time in the first half and from a Dimitri Payet corner, after the Frenchman, who lasted the full 90 mintues, found Carroll with his cross. The forward’s header went straight towards Tom Heaton, but the Burnley keeper seemed to be impeded by Michail Antonio and could not get to the ball. Instead it bounced back into the path of Winston Reid and, unwilling to give him a shooting opportunity, Ben Mee pulled the New Zealander to the ground. The referee, Robert Madley, awarded the penalty and Noble turned it in at the second attempt after his first was well saved by Heaton.\n\nFor Sean Dyche it was a goal that should never have been given. “It was a clear foul on Tom Heaton,” said the Burnley manager of Antonio’s block.\n\n“It’s very frustrating. Every other keeper goes on his back, flails around on the floor and it’s given. Because ours do it the proper way … now we’re called naive.

The clarity came back in the second half. We work hard, try to win every game and there’s been some good signs [in our away form].”\n\nNext up for Burnley are Spurs at White Hart Lane on Sunday. West Ham, meanwhile, welcome Hull City to the London Stadium and, after Wednesday night, the chance to secure back-to-back wins. But after speaking last week of his side’s need for a “clean sheet mentality”, Bilic believes his team must also shake off the mental “cramp” that afflicted them in the second half here.\n\n“I praised the players: the spirit, the mentality the clean sheet, all of that,” he said. “But I saw the cramp, the fear of winning. That cramp can only go away with climbing up the table but we managed it today and hopefully this should put us in a position that on Saturday we go in with less of that cramp and more confidence.”"}, {"date": "14/12/2016", "arena": "Selhurst Park", "attendance": 25547, "home_team": {"name": "Crystal Palace", "lineup": [{"name": "Wayne Hennessey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Kelly", "yellows": [45], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Scott Dann", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Damien Delaney", "yellows": [72], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joel Ward", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James McArthur", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [66], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [87]}, {"name": "Yohan Cabaye", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mathieu Flamini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Chung-Yong Lee", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [80]}, {"name": "Wilfried Zaha", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Benteke", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Julian Speroni", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fraizer Campbell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [87], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andros Townsend", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Ledley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Zeki Fryers", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [80], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Noor Husin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Wan-Bissaka", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Manchester United", "lineup": [{"name": "David De Gea", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eric Bailly", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [52]}, {"name": "Phil Jones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marcos Rojo", "yellows": [38], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daley Blind", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ander Herrera", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Carrick", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paul Pogba", "yellows": [70], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [45], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Juan Mata", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [70]}, {"name": "Zlatan Ibrahimovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [88], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wayne Rooney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [80]}], "subs": [{"name": "Jesse Lingard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [70], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Young", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marcus Rashford", "yellows": [84], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [80], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sergio Romero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marouane Fellaini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bastian Schweinsteiger", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matteo Darmian", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [52], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "A ruthless streak has been restored to Manchester United’s approach after all.

It’s the most difficult league in the world, so if you come here you want to show what you can do. That’s what he did. It’s not just about goals.

The manager was not inclined to hoist up the 35-year-old as his “best” signing but, even on a massive weekly wage, he can feel like a bargain when he conjures definitive moments such as these.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Paul Pogba opens the scoring moments before the half-time whistle.

He scored with glee, with his team-mates swarming in disbelief around a tickled Delaney.\n\nYet Palace were unable to build on that momentum and, when United were denied a penalty after Joe Ledley’s handball in the area, they rallied.\n\nMata had a goal disallowed from Rojo’s nod back, television replays subsequently suggesting he was a toe offside at most, before Ibrahimovic found his range. “Even if this game finished 1-1, I’d have the same feeling towards my players,” said Mourinho. “The performances have been good for a long time, so the players deserve this: happiness at home, and happiness away.”\n\nThey are edging back towards the fringes of the title race. Palace, in contrast, are mired in a more desperate struggle at the other end. They could take heart from their effort and commitment, and the reality they had prised apart a stubborn defence, but familiar mistakes crept in.\n\nJust as against City recently, a second-half revival went undone at the last by a lapse of concentration. The decision to fling on Fraizer Campbell for McArthur near the end, disrupting shape yet again, might also be scrutinised.

"report": "When the owners of Manchester City finally managed to persuade Pep Guardiola to oversee the next stage of their masterplan it is fair to say they probably did not expect to be approaching Christmas scuffling with a team of Watford’s limitations for their first league win at home in almost three months.\n\nThe revolution certainly has not taken off as people might have anticipated but City should feel better for this victory even if it was tempered by another terrible blow for the luckless Ilkay Gündogan. On the one hand, the goals from Pablo Zabaleta and David Silva ought to improve City’s confidence going into Sunday’s game against Arsenal. On the other, it was clear from Guardiola’s body language that he expects bad news when Gündogan goes for a scan on suspected knee-ligament damage. City’s manager could not guarantee the Germany international, facing his third serious injury in three years, would play again this season. “A long time,” was Guardiola’s prediction.\n\nCesc Fàbregas sweeps Chelsea past Sunderland and six points clear at top Read more\n\nFor Gündogan, that would be cruel luck and it was perplexing that City’s medical staff let him try to run off the injury when it was clear immediately from the way he raised his hand that an accidental collision with Nordin Amrabat had left him in distress, not least as it was the same knee he dislocated earlier this year. Gündogan lasted only a few more minutes before it became apparent he had to come off in a game that also saw Roberto Pereyra, the Watford player, suffer a potentially serious knee injury.\n\nPereyra will also require an x-ray to ascertain the seriousness of the problem after a disappointing night for Watford whose manager, Walter Mazzarri, was surely trying it on by claiming, more than once, they had “played a great game”. Claudio Bravo, City’s erratic goalkeeper, was not required to make a save until the 76th minute and when the opposition were operating with such a drastic lack of ambition it was not easy to be sure whether or not City should be too encouraged – or if they were simply lucky not to encounter a team who might have posed them more problems.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ilkay Gündogan receives treatment on the pitch before being substituted. Photograph: Martin Rickett/PA\n\nGuardiola talked afterwards about a satisfying evening’s work, ensuring only their fifth win in 16 matches, but it had been a subdued atmosphere before Zabaleta turned up the volume with his first goal for two years.\n\nUntil that point Watford had looked reasonably comfortable. Yet the decision to start with Troy Deeney on the bench, mindful that a booking would have meant his suspension for the trip to Sunderland on Saturday, summed up Watford’s conservatism and the visitors were increasingly being forced back as the game went past the half-hour mark.\n\nKevin De Bruyne was prominently involved, as he so often is, and when his left-footed cross eluded four team-mates inside the six-yard area Zabaleta was at the far post to drive his volley past Heurelho Gomes.\n\nGuardiola had continued his policy of wholesale changes, reverting to an orthodox back four but finding no place for John Stones after his recent lapses, as well as leaving out four other players from the 4-2 defeat at Leicester City last Saturday. Guardiola has now made 27 personnel changes in the league when it comes to his team’s goalkeeping and defensive positions and 55 for the entire team. He is not the only manager who likes to switch things around but it might help to explain why his team are still finding themselves under their rapidly evolving tactics.\n\nNot that it was entirely easy to understand Mazzarri’s thinking, either, and perhaps if Watford had dared show a touch more adventure they might have found out why Guardiola’s team had kept only two clean sheets in their previous 15 league fixtures.\n\nZlatan Ibrahimovic late goal gives Manchester United win at Crystal Palace Read more\n\nFor long spells it felt as though no one had bothered to inform the visitors that Bravo could be a danger to his own team. Nicolás Otamendi and Aleksandar Kolarov were playing in the centre of City’s defence and, again, it was perplexing why their opponents did not do more to find out why these two have a reputation for being accident-prone. Jerome Sinclair, a summer recruit from Wigan Athletic, was given his first start in attack but he and Odion Ighalo were only on the fringes of a flat and prosaic team performance.\n\nRaheem Sterling, to give him his due, tried to enliven the night from City’s perspective and there were plenty of touches from De Bruyne and Silva to admire. Yaya Touré helped everything to tick over and Nolito, deputising for the suspended Sergio Agüero, produced one of the game’s better moments with a lovely turn away from Sebastian Prödl.\n\nOverall, though, it was a drab match. Étienne Capoue at least had a go at testing Bravo with a shot into the goalkeeper’s midriff before Ighalo volleyed over Amrabat’s right-wing delivery, Watford’s best chance to change the complexion of the night.\n\nThat miss was costly as Silva stroked in Sterling’s pass following a three-on-two breakaway but Guardiola, reflecting on Gündogan’s misfortune, could not disguise some blurred emotions.

Marko Arnautovic was sent off at the mid-point of the opening half a goalless draw felt a hardly surprising result given the old cliche about 10 men being difficult to break down.\n\nSouthampton dominated what at times was a nasty affair but “could have-should have” is another football maxim which concerns the bottom line being all about the result of a game. So, by the close Claude Puel’s side must have rued their profligacy and Mark Hughes’s troops could feel pride at their bloody-mindedness in hanging on for a point.\n\nManchester City sink tame Watford with Pablo Zabaleta and David Silva strikes Read more\n\nFor this quintessential mid-table affair – 12th versus 11th at kick-off – both managers made three changes. In came Ryan Shawcross, Glenn Whelan and Jonathan Walters for Stoke, with Ryan Bertrand, Steven Davis and Shane Long selected for the visitors.\n\nStoke threatened first. Xherdan Shaqiri wandered in from the right, slipped the ball beyond José Fonte, and Joe Allen’s shot forced a corner after Fraser Forster saved. This amounted to nothing as Charlie Adam’s overhead kick was off target.\n\nThis early warning was followed by more for Southampton. Allen again found space, this time a little deeper near halfway, and Adam passed into him and made the visitors scramble to clear.\n\nThe best riposte for Southampton was to ask a question of Stoke and they did so twice. Whelan dawdled where no player ever should – on the fringe of his own penalty area – and he was robbed by Sofiane Boufal, whose snapshot was saved by Lee Grant. The second poser derived from another Stoke mistake, this time from a stray Erik Pieters pass, and from here Shane Long took aim at Grant.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Lee Grant makes a flying save to deny Jay Rodriguez as Stoke kept Southampton at bay. Photograph: Matt Bunn/BPI/REX/Shutterstock\n\nThe next culprit in this series of Stoke errors was the entire defence – Bertrand raced along the left and his cross should have been cleared but it was allowed to roll in front of Grant all the way to the other side of the pitch.\n\nNow came the end of Arnautovic, a particularly unprofessional early exit. Only 24 minutes had been played when the Austrian stabbed a boot high into Boufal’s thigh. Out came Anthony Taylor’s card for a straight red that means a three-game ban for the 27-year-old, who should know better. The referee’s decision was accompanied by boos and when Bertrand took the free-kick he aimed it straight into Grant’s hands.\n\nHughes was not happy at the decision. “I was disappointed with the sending-off – it is a mistimed tackle, he was clearly caught but I didn’t think it was intentional, just a mistimed tackle. Officials seem to think they come here and need to give early yellow cards to settle [down the game]. Those days are long gone, we play a different type of football,” he said.\n\nHughes, taking charge of his 400th Premier League game, was proud of his players. “To a man we were excellent,” he said. “It was easy to accept our fate, and [accept] the game has gone away from us.”\n\nSome relief came for Stoke when Pieters repeated Bertrand’s trick at the other end and skimmed a ball in from the left that raced before Forster, went uncleared and ended up on the opposing flank.\n\nThe niggle factor remained, though. Allen launched a tackle at James Ward-Prowse that found only a foot and the Welshman was cautioned as a result. The unsavoury stuff had also included Long aiming an elbow at Bruno Martins Indi; the striker may yet face retrospective action as Taylor seemed not to see the incident.\n\nHughes was unimpressed, comparing this to the Arnautovic decision. “All you ask is officials get key decisions right, and if you’re not it’s not good,” he said.\n\nSouthampton used their one-man advantage well in the second half. Cuco Martina was booed throughout – perhaps (strangely) for taking the throw that led to Arnautovic’s red card – yet he was a persistent threat along the right and Redmond displayed a willingness to switch wings to aid the defender.\n\nHughes had sent on Mame Diouf for Shaqiri, a move that had the Swiss punching a seat and plonking himself down in a major huff. This may have been the emotion felt by Puel, too, when one of his own replacements, Jay Rodriguez, hit only air from close range when Boufal laid on what appeared a certain finish.\n\n“It’s a disappointment,” said Puel afterwards. “We lost two points tonight.”"}, {"date": "14/12/2016", "arena": "White Hart Lane", "attendance": 31347, "home_team": {"name": "Tottenham Hotspur", "lineup":

Apart from a wobble at the beginning of the second half they were too slick for a Hull City team that once again looked fragile on the road.

Pochettino, clearly, does not want to partner him with Wanyama in the middle of the pitch and instead he used Eriksen alongside the Kenyan. Dier played on the right side of the back three.\n\nThe idea was to provide the platform for the full-backs, Kyle Walker and Danny Rose, to bomb on and it worked. After 14 minutes, Rose got in behind the Hull defence to lay on the opening goal for Eriksen while the second followed an incision up the other flank from Walker.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest David Marshall tips a Christian Eriksen shot onto the post. Photograph: Steven Paston/PA\n\nThe initial ball forward for the first had come from Jan Vertonghen and when Rose jinked inside Ahmed Elmohamady – all too easily – and rolled back to Eriksen, he crashed his shot high past Marshall. Tottenham had completed 30 passes in the build-up but it was Vertonghen’s that had got them motoring.\n\nEriksen’s second was prompted by Dier’s chipped ball for Walker and his low cross was just too far in front of Harry Kane. Eriksen tapped home at the far post.\n\nHull had a couple of flickers in the first half through Jake Livermore – one of four former Spurs in the visitors’ ranks – and their biggest opportunity, on the hour, also fell to the midfielder. Tottenham were still appealing for a penalty following Andrew Robertson’s challenge on Eriksen when Livermore surged up to the other end to see a shot blocked. The follow-up was an even better chance, but Hugo Lloris stuck out a boot to save. Phelan and Pochettino would both reference that moment.\n\nMark Noble counts his spot luck as West Ham see off bullish Burnley Read more\n\nTottenham had called the tune in the first half, with the recalled Moussa Sissoko and Dele Alli prominent in support of Kane. Sissoko caught the eye with some rampaging runs and when he was substituted late on he departed to applause. Alli’s best moment came on 35 minutes when he took down a high ball from Dier, spun and worked Marshall with the shot.\n\nTottenham’s attack of the jitters early in the second half had not been advertised and Wanyama drew the crowd’s ire with a bit of dawdling and a weak shot, after a good chance had opened up for him. When Livermore went close to the equaliser, Pochettino immediately sent on Harry Winks for Alli, who did not look happy, and moved Eriksen further forward. Soon afterwards, Eriksen had his second.

headers to keep West Bromwich Albion airborne in the Premier League and Swansea City flapping near the foot of the table. It was the Venezuela international’s first three-goal haul for his club and took his tally to the season to seven from 15 league matches, an excellent strike rate for a player who often fulfils a lonely role up front in a team that is not always minded to attack.\n\nAlbion’s ambitions are growing, however, and this win propelled them back to seventh in the table.\n\nTwo-goal Christian Eriksen inspires Tottenham to victory over Hull City Read more\n\nTony Pulis’s evening was sullied a tad when Wayne Routledge struck to deny Albion a clean sheet, but that detail could not take too much lustre off a highly satisfying win for the hosts. Nor could it console the visitors, who had arrived hoping to secure back-to-back victories for the first time under Bob Bradley but departed knowing that they had not bared their teeth until it was too late.\n\nThe frustration for the American manager was that his team finished strongly and started quite solidly but lost because they unravelled for a spell after half-time. “There was a 13-minute stretch where we seemed to lose our way,” he said. It was during that stretch that Rondón put the match beyond Swansea’s reach.\n\nThe salvo was all the more welcome for Rondón because he had squandered Albion’s only two clear chances in the first period. After a quarter of an hour he was denied by Lukasz Fabianski but the striker was visibly annoyed with himself for making a save possible, his effort from 10 yards placed too close to the goalkeeper and undoing splendid preparatory work by Matt Phillips and James Morrison. Later in the half he was sent clear again but did not get his shot away fast enough, allowing Alfie Mawson to make a terrific block.\n\nAt that stage Swansea were well in the game. But the visitors’ nimble moves, orchestrated by the ever-wonderful Leon Britton, tended to fizzle out before reaching the opposing box. That meant they failed to test an Albion defence that was missing two of its stalwarts, with Jonny Evans injured and Craig Dawson suspended. Swansea’s only notable shot in the first half came from a predictable source: a free-kick by Gylfi Sigurdsson. The Icelander curled his shot over the wall from 20 yards but straight into the arms of Ben Foster.\n\nAs the first half wore on the tide turned on the Swans and they were grateful to make it to half-time with the scoreboard blank. The reprieve, though, only seemed to lull them into negligence.\n\nFabianksi, in fairness, remained alert. He made an urgent intervention within 50 seconds of the resumption, bounding off his line to snaffle the ball at the feet of Nacer Chadli. But Swansea’s defenders were sleep-walking and conceded three goals in 13 minutes. The first came five minutes into the half when Phillips swung in a free-kick from the right and Rondón stole a march on his markers to head powerfully into the net from eight yards. Mawson jumped up and down in impotent anger but Swansea would need to channel their frustration into something more constructive to draw level.\n\nThey did not. Albion threatened to widen the gap just before the hour, but Phillips could not match Rondón’s heading prowess when presented with an opportunity by Darren Fletcher. Two minutes later Rondón gave another demonstration of the art, expertly steering a header into the bottom corner from a cross by Chris Brunt. Again, Swansea’s defenders had done nothing to deter him.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Swansea’s Lukasz Fabianski is put under pressure by Salomón Rondón. Photograph: Nick Potts/PA\n\nTheir inattention amounted to encouragement. So Rondón wasted no time completing his hat-trick, nodding powerfully home from 12 yards from another delivery by Brunt.\n\n“It was a wonderful hat-trick,” said Pulis. “He’s getting better. He finds it very difficult sometimes to understand how hard every game is in the Premier League. He was up and down last year but he’s been more consistent this year. And the great thing about this match is that he missed two great chances in the first half and it hasn’t affected him.”\n\nSwansea came back to life only when it was too late. In the 78th minute the substitute Modou Barrow made the sort of jagged run that they had been lacking. It led, thanks partly to a misjudgment by Jonas Olsson, to Routledge slamming the ball into the net from 12 yards. Foster then made a fabulous reflex save in stoppage time to prevent a cross from cannoning off Gareth McAuley for an own goal.\n\n“There was a spell late on when we played some decent stuff,” said Bradley. “But one of the most important things that we have to be able to improve is that if we do go behind, we have to be able to get back into the game, string some passes together, not panic or lose concentration or belief. That’s the part that gets me angry.”"}, {"date": "13/12/2016", "arena": "Vitality Stadium", "attendance": 11068, "home_team": {"name": "Bournemouth", "lineup": [{"name": "Artur Boruc", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Simon Francis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steve Cook", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathan Aké", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charlie Daniels", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Arter", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Wilshere", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Smith", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joshua King", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [79]}, {"name": "Marc Pugh", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [34], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Benik Afobe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [68]}], "subs": [{"name": "Dan Gosling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [79], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Max Gradel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Callum Wilson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [68], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Brad Smith", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Federici", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tyrone Mings", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordon Ibe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Leicester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Ron-Robert Zieler", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Luis Hernández", "yellows": [87], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wes Morgan", "yellows": [83], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robert Huth", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [82]}, {"name": "Christian Fuchs", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Riyad Mahrez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andy King", "yellows": [36], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daniel Amartey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marc Albrighton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [74]}, {"name": "Islam Slimani", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Jamie Vardy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Benjamin Chilwell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ahmed Musa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [74], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Hamer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shinji Okazaki", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Demarai Gray", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leonardo Ulloa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [82], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nampalys Mendy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Bournemouth handed Leicester City another Premier League wake-up call after Marc Pugh’s first goal of the season condemned the champions to an eighth league defeat. Leicester’s unwanted away record continues and it is now eight months since Claudio Ranieri’s side tasted victory on the road in the league. Eddie Howe, in contrast, left the field after kissing Nathan Aké, high-fiving Steve Cook and with his team eighth in the table, their highest ever position.\n\nLeicester’s return of one point from their first eight away matches is the lowest total by a defending top-flight title-winning team.\n\nAfter walking out on to the pitch to stretch their legs, Jamie Vardy and Marc Albrighton were soaked by the Bournemouth sprinklers. From that moment on it was a miserable outing for Leicester, who failed to show the mettle of champions in Ranieri’s 200th Premier League match.\n\n“We have to react, we have to be more concentrated, more determined, [to] show more willingness. We need something more – more everything,” Ranieri said. “In the Champions League we play so well and in the Premier League we do not. I do not know why.”\n\nRanieri looked as baffled as anybody by his side’s mysterious away form, with their last win away from the King Power Stadium coming at Sunderland in April.\n\nVardy was guilty of spurning a golden chance after racing on to Riyad Mahrez’s crisp through ball in a first 45 minutes dominated by the hosts.\n\nWilliams atones for error as Everton come from behind to sink Arsenal Read more\n\nBournemouth could have been in front inside three minutes had Adam Smith’s head made contact with Charlie Daniels’ low cross. Jack Wilshere, playing in a deeper role, also tested Ron-Robert Zieler with an effort from distance. Howe praised Wilshere’s “best game” in a Bournemouth shirt.\n\nZieler booted his goalkick into the backside of Benik Afobe and the ball ran out of play for a throw-in. Afobe reacted quickly, teeing up Pugh, the Bournemouth winger making his first Premier League start of the season, and he attempted an ambitious lob on the German goalkeeper.\n\nRobert Huth saw a shot deflected wide from a corner but Leicester were unable to truly test Artur Boruc in the Bournemouth goal. Huth was later fortunate not to pick up a booking after tugging back Harry Arter as Bournemouth counter-attacked. Bournemouth were in no mood to back down and the home side were eventually rewarded for their effort.\n\nAfter being picked out by Simon Francis, the marauding Smith slid the ball across from the right for Afobe who fired low towards goal, only for Zieler to save with his legs. But the rebound fell straight to Pugh, Bournemouth’s longest-serving player, and he half-volleyed the ball past the Leicester goalkeeper, whose right hand was not strong enough to prevent the shot hitting the net.\n\nBehind at the interval, Ranieri’s team arrived early for the second half, with the club-record signing, Islam Slimani, replaced by Shinji Okazaki. “I said ‘show me the desire to win the match’ and sometimes we have to be more aggressive and press higher,” Ranieri said. There was plenty of endeavour but Leicester, who were drawn against Sevilla in Monday’s Champions League last‑16 draw, came up short on quality.\n\nHowe had urged his side to show no signs of a “hangover” after the defeat at Burnley on Saturday and Bournemouth were dogged yet inventive throughout here. “We have been in the Premier League a while but [to say we are eighth] is a nice thing,” the Bournemouth manager said. “I think the most pleasing thing is this season we have the ability to respond to setbacks very well, and that’s a really good sign for the future.\n\n“I still think there’s a lot more to come and I think we are in a really good position to get better. The club’s come so far so quickly I am always trying to look for the next goal and that’s now to try and beat Southampton [on Sunday].”\n\nLeicester’s prime weaponry was blunted. A more direct approach almost paid dividends, with Luis Hernández’s long throw momentarily unsettling the Bournemouth back line. Bournemouth were forced to soak up Leicester pressure and the referee, Paul Tierney, waved away appeals for a penalty when Aké clumsily upended Vardy inside the box.\n\nLeicester could have snatched a point with only injury-time remaining but Bournemouth, Boruc and his defence stood tall. Vardy crossed from the right for Leonardo Ulloa, a late substitute, but the Bournemouth goalkeeper somehow kept out his close-range shot before Okazaki was denied by the diving legs of Cook and

Ross Barkley, James McCarthy and Aaron Lennon of all people snapped into a series of challenges and the mood transformed.\n\nArsenal faded, and Mesut Özil’s woeful defending for Everton’s winner – backing away as Barkley’s corner arrived at the penalty spot – was an alarming sight for a manager with designs on the title.\n\nMarc Pugh’s half-volley drives Bournemouth past Leicester City Read more\n\nWenger erred in his complaint over a corner in the build-up to Everton’s winner but was correct to inject a sense of perspective after the game. This was Arsenal’s first away defeat in the Premier League since 28 February after all, their first loss since the opening game of the season and they are in the midst of a gruelling schedule. But the return of a familiar flaw – “You go face to face,” Koeman said after his latest managerial win against Arsenal – will be a cause for disquiet at the Emirates Stadium.\n\nThere was still time for a remarkable finale after Williams’s header. Phil Jagielka picked up a second yellow card for pulling back substitute Lucas Pérez and as a consequence the Everton captain will miss the Merseyside derby next week. From the resulting free-kick, with Petr Cech challenging his counterpart Maarten Stekelenburg, there was mayhem as Séamus Coleman blocked from Nacho Monreal, Leighton Baines did likewise from Alex Iwobi on the goal-line, Alexis Sánchez appealed for a penalty against Barkley, and Everton broke but were somehow unable to release a shot on a goal missing its goalkeeper.\n\nThere was no time to rue the miss and Koeman, having called for more aggression before kick-off, was rewarded not only with three valuable points but vastly improved contributions from Barkley, McCarthy and Enner Valencia, making his first league start for the club. The Everton manager had claimed his squad were unbalanced and lacking both physically and mentally on the eve of Arsenal’s visit and his concerns were borne out during a poor opening.\n\nArsenal, with Sánchez’s movement spreading anxiety throughout the home defence, could have been ahead from their first attack when Özil swept over from Monreal’s inviting pull-back. The contrast between the teams’ attacking styles was increasingly apparent before the visitors took the lead. Arsenal played with the composure and imagination of a settled, confident side while Everton again resorted to hit-and-hope long balls to an isolated Romelu Lukaku. They appeared bereft of any other ploy but needed one after falling behind in slapstick fashion.\n\nÖzil opened the Everton defence with an exquisite ball down the left and that was the only touch of quality before the ball nestled in the back of the Gwladys Street net. Having dealt with the danger, Valencia overran the ball on the edge of his area. It fell to Barkley, who was sluggish and dispossessed by Francis Coquelin, then to Ashley Williams, who completely missed the ball and took out Idrissa Gueye instead, leaving Jagielka to collect his first booking with a foul on Coquelin on the edge of the area. Sánchez applied the coup de mess. His low free-kick deflected off Williams’s calf to leave Stekelenburg floundering as he got a hand to the ball but could not prevent it sailing in.\n\nEverton bare their teeth at last as Arsenal feel full force of Goodison | Paul Wilson Read more\n\nArsenal were comfortable, Everton lacked the basics but with Koeman despairing at Stekelenburg’s long clearances and the crowd restless, the contest was transformed by nothing more than a show of aggression and commitment from the home side. Lukaku drove over, Lennon sliced a decent chance wide and, with Everton on top, Coleman equalised moments before the break. The goal will have realised Arsenal’s worries about losing Shkodran Mustafi from the heart of their defence through injury. Baines swept a dangerous cross into the area with his right foot where his fellow full-back rose unmarked between Laurent Koscielny and Gabriel to convert a glancing header.\n\nColeman’s celebration – cupping his ear to the crowd – perhaps revealed his annoyance with recent criticism and there was a minor melee on half-time involving McCarthy, Özil, Williams and Granit Xhaka. Koeman could not complain: anger suited Everton and Arsenal, after those early flashes, were relatively subdued in reply. Theo Walcott and Alex Oxlade‑Chamberlain were anonymous and it was no surprise when Wenger withdrew both.\n\nArsenal had their moments in the second half, Özil missing another cut-back from the left, but they were susceptible to Lukaku’s strength on the counter-attack and the awareness of Barkley. Goodison implored its men forward in the dying stages.

The leaders have reimposed their three-point advantage at the top of the division, and ended West Bromwich Albion’s own impressive burst of form in the process. There is something relentless about Antonio Conte’s team at present and, since early October, no one has found a way of checking their progress.\n\nAntonio Conte calls possibility of Chelsea points deduction ‘a joke’ Read more\n\nTony Pulis and his industrious team came agonisingly close. It was only as this game entered its final 15 minutes, with the hosts on their third formation of the afternoon and anxiety mounting in the stands, that West Brom finally cracked. Cesc Fàbregas, flung on in desperation as a central playmaker in the rejigged lineup, lofted a hopeful pass down the right which Gareth McAuley would have expected to repel. He had spent most of the afternoon doing just that, shepherding the ball away to safety with allies forever close by but, on this occasion, he was ambushed by the rampaging Diego Costa.\n\nThe forward bustled in, stealing the ball and holding off the centre-half as he attempted to wrest it back, before ripping a glorious shot from a horribly tight angle into the far top corner as Ben Foster edged out to smother. The finish was emphatic, an afternoon’s frustration expunged with one swing of his left boot. “It was a good and maybe fortunate pass, but it was all about Diego for the goal,” said Fàbregas. “He made the pass special, fighting for that ball.” Costa, leaning on his team-mate to interpret, merely warned that there is more to come. That sounded ominous for defenders up and down the division.\n\nChelsea are growing used to the forward saving the day. It was his bullying of Nicolás Otamendi at the Etihad Stadium last Saturday which drew the league leaders level, his flash of opportunism which had claimed the points at Middlesbrough, and his vicious, curling shot which had so deflated Southampton at St Mary’s. There have been 12 goals already this season; November’s Premier League player of the month, such a snarling presence last season, is now a source of inspiration. He had toiled alone for long periods here against the visitors’ imposing rearguard, with little hint of reward en route, but did not grow frustrated, and even offered only a smirk when team-mates became enraged at West Brom’s perceived timewasting.\n\nManchester United v Tottenham Hotspur: Premier League – live! Read more\n\nThe Spain international has not been booked since accruing his fourth caution for dissent in Chelsea’s last league loss, at Arsenal on 24 September. The cardless run, Costa’s best for six years, is as remarkable as his goal tally and at this rate it is feasible he might reach the amnesty on New Year’s Day without incurring a ban. “It’s incredible that, after the Arsenal defeat, Diego had four yellow cards and was on the edge, and he has continued to stay on the edge,” said Conte. “I think he can arrive in January without a yellow card. I hope [he does].\n\n“Look at the image of Diego against Manchester City [when he played peacemaker in the brawl at the end]. I always tell my players to stay focused on the pitch, think about playing football, doing the movement we tried in training sessions. I don’t like provocation, I don’t like bad attitudes, and I’m trying to transfer this to my players. But I’m very lucky because I have players with great behaviour. Diego is enjoying this football. He’s showing his passion in the right way. You ask why it happened in the past, but I don’t know. Now I can only talk about his commitment, his work-rate during the games, and it’s fantastic. I want this from all my players. I try to get all my players to think like this.”\n\nThe image of Costa as a role model, or even as a calming influence, may seem incongruous, but he serves to reassure these days.\n\nChelsea 1-0 West Bromwich Albion: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nThe bear hug Conte offered the Spain international at the final whistle summed up his significance. This had been such a grind, a test of patience as much as quality, against admirably resolute opponents who flung down a four-man barrier of centre-halves supplemented by workaholic wingers who plugged the full-back areas whenever they were denied the ball. All the areas of the pitch where Chelsea have flourished over the last two months were duly clogged up, with clear-cut opportunities scarce.\n\nThe visitors actually created more presentable half-chances, Salomón Rondón skimming a shot wide of the far post after holding off David Luiz, before retreating into their shells after the interval. “We have better players than we showed today because we needed to find a pass to get us further up the pitch,” said Pulis. “I’m disappointed for the players because they put in so much effort and commitment. To be beaten by that one mistake …”\n\nHe was actually defeated as much by a flash of brilliance from the Premier League’s striker of the moment.

The gap is still considerable, at 13 points, and “you’re not special any more” seems to be the soundtrack from Old Trafford’s away end these days but, ultimately, José Mourinho’s team could reflect on a satisfying afternoon, featuring some encouraging news about the injury sustained by Henrikh Mkhitaryan, their match-winner.\n\nSouthampton beat Middlesbrough thanks to Sofiane Boufal’s stunning goal Read more\n\nMkhitaryan was taken off on a stretcher after damaging his left ankle trying to elude Danny Rose’s sliding challenge and it would have been rotten luck for the Armenian if it had meant a long period of rehabilitation just as he was finally demonstrating why Mourinho was so keen to bring him to the club in the first place. His 29th-minute goal followed the one he scored against Zorya Luhansk in the Europa League last Thursday and, although Paul Pogba was the outstanding performer in their latest victory, Mkhitaryan had shown again that he was adjusting to Mourinho’s demands and is capable of shaping the team’s fortunes. His goal spared United from going three months since the last time they won a league fixture on their own ground and there was considerable relief, an hour or so after the final whistle, when the initial prognosis was merely a one or two-week lay-off.\n\nUnited still have a few issues, judging by the jarring boos when Marouane Fellaini, the player the crowd like the least, started warming up in the second half and Victor Wanyama might wake in a cold sweat when he thinks about the headed opportunity, 10 minutes after the interval, that could have changed the complexion of the match. Yet it was still an encouraging victory for Mourinho’s team and a difficult afternoon for Tottenham Hotspur was probably summed up by the moment Dele Alli, the impudent young buck, tried to upstage Michael Carrick by slipping the ball through his opponent’s legs. Carrick, the older man by 15 years, was much too wise for that kind of frivolity. The nutmeg jammed, Carrick came away with the ball and United went on the attack again.\n\nCan this team find a way back into the title race? That might be pushing it but Pogba’s form is certainly a cause for optimism and Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s range of qualities make up for his lack of movement on the frontline. United always look better with Carrick’s elegance in midfield and, defensively, it should not be overlooked Mourinho has been making do without three-quarters of his first-choice back four. A quartet of, right to left, Antonio Valencia, Phil Jones, Marcos Rojo and Matteo Darmian might be thought of as potentially vulnerable but they restricted Spurs to only one clear opportunity. Jones, in particular, deserves to keep his place even when Chris Smalling and Eric Bailly are fully fit and on the one occasion Valencia switched off, failing to react when Christian Eriksen swung a free-kick into the penalty area, Wanyama’s header was horribly misplaced when he had a golden chance to equalise.\n\nDiego Costa strikes again as Chelsea go top with win over West Brom Read more\n\nMauricio Pochettino’s team can certainly play much better, although, in fairness to Mourinho, perhaps the credit should go to the home side for operating with a structure that successfully negated the attacking threat of Kyle Walker and Rose, the opposition’s forward-thinking full-backs. It was unusual to see Tottenham play with so little width or penetration and, although there were long-range efforts from Eriksen and Son Heung-Min, Harry Kane had a difficult afternoon, not least as it was his mistake that led to the decisive moment.\n\nSpurs had been breaking forward when the ball reached Kane in the centre circle but when he looked to his right, perhaps expecting one of Walker’s overlapping runs, there was nobody in support. Kane came back the other way but succeeded only in playing the ball to Ander Herrera and suddenly Tottenham were in trouble. Herrera’s pass was weighted expertly for Mkhitaryan to run clear and a powerful right-foot shot was still rising as it soared above Hugo Lloris into the roof of the net.\n\nThe closest United came from that point was the free-kick that Pogba curled against the crossbar in the 63rd minute. Soon afterwards, Pogba was denied by Lloris’s save but it was not just the midfielder’s attacking threat that caught the eye. Pogba’s athleticism and high-kneed running style makes him a fiendishly difficult opponent and, if anything, he needs some of the players around him to raise their own level of performance. Anthony Martial, once again, looked considerably less effective than in his first season in Manchester.\n\nMourinho resisted any temptation to bring on Wayne Rooney in the closing stages and chose instead to introduce Marcus Rashford, hoping that his speed might help on the counterattack. Rashford seems to have misplaced his wow factor and the tactic seldom worked but United reached the final whistle without too many problems and Pochettino had to face questions afterwards about why, having beaten Manchester City in October, his side have subsequently taken only a solitary point against Arsenal, Chelsea and United.\n\nThe Spurs manager did not really have any answers, a little

Southampton needed this. The natives on the south coast have become restless, feeling stuck in a rut of less than thrilling football, and dire back-to-back results had turned an unforgiving spotlight on to the visit of an improving Middlesbrough team.\n\nHenrikh Mkhitaryan seals spoils for Manchester United against Tottenham Read more\n\nSouthampton had lost at Crystal Palace the previous weekend and crashed out of the Europa League on Thursday night, after the tepid 1-1 home draw with Hapoel Be’er Sheva. The chips were down and, when the whistle went after what was a dreary first half, Puel’s players were booed from the field. It felt like a sign of the times.\n\nEnter Sofiane Boufal. The £21m summer signing from Lille had endured a difficult first half, which was summed up when he was booked at the end of it for kicking the ball up and away into the stands. It had looked as though he intended to whack it against the advertising hoardings and get it back.\n\nBoufal would settle himself to provide the decisive moment early in the second half and what a moment it was. He took aim from 25 yards and his drive fizzed into the near corner of Víctor Valdés’s net. It was Boufal’s first goal in the Premier League and his second in Southampton’s colours. His first had also been a screamer in a 1-0 home win. That had come against Sunderland in the EFL Cup.\n\nA goal-fest was never likely. Southampton and Middlesbrough had entered the contest with 13 goals apiece from 15 league fixtures – the lowest returns in the division. Furthermore, Southampton had lost Charlie Austin to a serious shoulder injury that will require surgery while Middlesbrough were without Álvaro Negredo and Gastón Ramírez.\n\nThe visitors had arrived on the back of an encouraging run, which had taken in the draws at Arsenal and Manchester City, but they were second best throughout. When they were asked to respond to Boufal’s goal, they had no answers. Aitor Karanka said that he was pleased with the application of his players and he claimed that, on another day, the chances (note the plural) they created would have gone in.\n\nIt was difficult to know which ones he was referring to because, apart from the 34th-minute breakaway from Viktor Fischer and the rebound efforts from Cristhian Stuani, Middlesbrough created nothing. Perhaps Karanka thought that the early flicker from Jordan Rhodes, when Fraser Forster had come out to smother at the striker’s feet, ought to have been taken into consideration.\n\nKaranka said that “the main thing is not to concede” and he talked about being unconcerned about how his team were now the outright lowest scorers in the league. “The main thing to build a house is the foundations,” he said. Being able to stay in a game, with a puncher’s chance of a result, was uppermost in his thoughts. But at 1-0, Middlesbrough did not even threaten the equaliser and it was a surprise that the jet-heeled Adama Traoré was left on the bench until the 81st minute.\n\nWith Middlesbrough compact and set up to counterattack, it was clear at the outset that the onus would be on Southampton to make something happen. The pressure came from the home support, who have witnessed some underwhelming stuff and whose mood was not helped by the Europa League exit. It was easy to detect their frustration during the first half and there was no shortage of chuntering whenever the ball went sideways or back. Puel admitted that the players were “nervous” after Hapoel Be’er Sheva.\n\nThe first period was a difficult watch and the only flicker of excitement came on 34 minutes when Fischer surged on to a sloppy back pass from James Ward-Prowse. He was forced wide by the ever impressive Virgil van Dijk before he went around Forster, shot and saw the covering José Fonte clear off the line. The ball broke to Stuani, whose first effort was blocked by Sam McQueen. He lifted the second over the crossbar.\n\nSouthampton had first-half chances through Jordy Clasie, Jay Rodriguez and Ward-Prowse but they needed greater urgency and incision. Puel tweaked his tactics for the second half, moving Boufal inside to play off Rodriguez, and he got what he was looking for. After Boufal had seen one shot blocked, he produced the decisive moment.\n\nCould Middlesbrough respond? The answer was an emphatic no, and it was Southampton who looked the likelier scorers of the next goal. The substitute Steven Davis headed off-target while Rodriguez saw another header cleared off the line by Adam Clayton. Rodriguez would somehow lift over from point-blank range in stoppage time.

Loris Karius’s teething troubles continued while Darren Randolph reacted to the final whistle by burying his head in a towel. The West Ham United keeper’s despair was understandable but, for his manager, humiliation has given way to hope.\n\nSlaven Bilic has been under intense scrutiny since the 5-1 home defeat by Arsenal and endured an ominous start at Anfield when Adam Lallana swept Liverpool into an early lead. West Ham’s reaction was not that of a team calling time on their manager. Bilic’s name resonated several times from the away end and his players gave what they could to alleviate the pressure. No cause was lost as Dimitri Payet and Michail Antonio edged the visitors ahead by the interval. They were under siege throughout the second half and cracked when Randolph gifted an equaliser to Divock Origi but, with Winston Reid and the goalkeeper impeccable thereafter, they held firm.\n\nHenrikh Mkhitaryan seals points for Manchester United against Tottenham Read more\n\nIt was Jürgen Klopp who had cause for concern after Liverpool’s latest suspect defensive display. The Liverpool manager may have been enraged by Steve Cook’s admission that Bournemouth targeted Karius as the weak link in last Sunday’s 4-3 reverse but his goalkeeper’s struggle to convince otherwise is the bigger problem. His 23-year-old’s positioning at Payet’s free-kick was questionable and his reactions slow for Antonio’s goal – though he was not the only Liverpool player culpable on that score.\n\nKlopp pinned Liverpool’s failure to win at home for only the second time this season on a collective rather than individual issue. “1-0 up, all good,” he said. “Then we got a little bit too excited, I would say. We had not a real formation for protection in these moments, nearly everybody was involved in our offensive situations and we had two centre-backs and sometimes Hendo behind the ball, and nearly everybody else the other side. We had a problem with second balls, but not too often and the goals weren’t in situations like that. But we let the game go a little bit away in these moments. We were not completely in control like we could have been.”\n\nWest Ham started like a team shorn of confidence and their defensive organisation was non-existent as Liverpool prospered from their first meaningful attack. Sadio Mané exchanged passes with Origi and reached the byline without a challenge in sight. The Belgium international forward just failed to connect with an inviting cross but it dropped to Lallana who, with Angelo Ogbonna ineffectual and Reid static, had time to control and beat Randolph with a low left foot finish.\n\nDiego Costa strikes again as Chelsea go top with win over West Brom Read more\n\nJust as defensive frailties persisted in the visitors, the same was true of the hosts. Karius and the defenders around him were again vulnerable under minimal pressure, as in the late collapse at Bournemouth, and Bilic’s forwards found encouragement to haul their team back into the contest. A routine clearance from Reid was sufficient to give Antonio the visitors’ first shot on goal with Liverpool wide open at the back. Karius saved on that occasion but was found wanting when West Ham levelled through Payet.\n\nThe intentions of the France international were abundantly clear as soon as Lallana tripped Pedro Obiang 25 yards from Liverpool’s goal. Not that being forewarned aided the Liverpool goalkeeper. Having sized up the free-kick in a central position Payet curled his effort over the wall and a yard inside Karius’ right hand post. The Germany under-21 international got a hand to the free-kick but, having positioned himself too far to the left, was unable to deny the set-piece specialist.\n\nWest Ham’s second was far worse from a Liverpool defensive perspective. Bilic’s side were the more threatening team as the first half wore on and their prodigious work-rate, typified by Mark Noble chasing down a lost cause and winning a corner from James Milner, was impressive. But they were gifted the lead when Havard Nordtveit’s cross deflected off Jordan Henderson’s head and wrong-footed the otherwise commanding Joël Matip. Neither Karius or Nathaniel Clyne reacted quickly enough to the danger and Antonio was given the freedom of Liverpool’s penalty area to flick the ball around the keeper and watch it trickle over the line.\n\nSouthampton beat Middlesbrough thanks to Sofiane Boufal’s stunning goal Read more\n\nTo their credit, Liverpool dominated thereafter with Roberto Firmino twice going close before the interval and Payet fortunate not to concede a penalty with a risky push on Lallana. They drew level courtesy of the biggest goalkeeping error of the game when Mané crossed from the left and Randolph, coming to claim at full stretch, let the ball fall from his grasp on to the toes of Origi. The Liverpool striker could barely believe his luck as he converted via the inside of a post from four yards out.\n\nKlopp’s team laid siege to the visiting defence for the majority of the second half. Georginio Wijnaldum twice went close, Clyne drove over from 18 yards and Randolph atoned for his error with a stunning save to prevent Henderson finding the top corner from fully 30 yards. “That was a crucial moment for us,” Bilic said. “Liverpool play a risky game and I expected us to hurt them more than we did in the second half, but it was a great point for us and a positive situation before a crucial week.”"}, {"date": "10/12/2016", "arena": "Vicarage Road", "attendance": 20769, "home_team": {"name": "Watford", "lineup": [{"name": "Heurelho Gomes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals":

three points.\n\nBournemouth crash back to earth as George Boyd goal gives Burnley win Read more\n\nAfter being outplayed on the pitch, the Dutchman failed to cover himself in glory after the match either. Rightly furious at his team letting a 1-0 lead become a 3-1 deficit before Romelu Lukaku’s second restored a sheen of credibility, he described his team as “reactive, not proactive”. But he also saw fit to criticise, more than once, his opponents’ style of play.\n\nWalter Mazzarri smiled when he heard that the Dutchman had described his team as “direct and aggressive”. Yes, his side had scored twice from set pieces, and yes the move that led to their opening goal had begun with a long ball from the back. But Mazzarri knew what had happened on the pitch, and Watford had been better in every department.\n\n“Each person has his opinion, luckily we all have eyes to see,” the Italian said through his interpreter. “I think you have all seen who played better today, who played good football. Every person has an opinion, but I don’t agree with him.”\n\nWatford’s star performer was Stefano Okaka. The striker arrived from Anderlecht in the summer for an undisclosed fee but his season has been disrupted by injury. This was only his second start of the season, his first came last week, but he looked anything but rusty as he pirouetted to score Watford’s equaliser in the 36th minute.\n\nAfter Sebastian Prödl gave Watford the lead with a towering header in the 59th minute, Okaka produced one of his own four minutes later. He lost his marker to meet José Holebas’s corner at the near post and flick the ball past Maarten Stekelenburg. The Italian was withdrawn late on to a standing ovation.\n\n“I’ve known him since he was very young and playing for Roma, he’s a great talent,” said Mazzari, who gave the striker a bear hug after his opening goal. “We had the opportunity to sign him in the summer and we took it. He is perfect for the Premier League because he doesn’t only help himself but helps his team-mates to play well and score.”\n\nWhere Everton would have been without their own two-goal striker is anyone’s guess. Lukaku opened the scoring when he coolly finished off Gareth Barry’s wonderful long ball, ironically Everton’s best pass of the game. The Belgian closed it out with a surefire header from the substitute Aaron Lennon’s cross. In between times, however, he was largely marooned, waiting hopefully for crosses that rarely came.\n\nFraizer Campbell’s late leveller rescues Crystal Palace after Hull heroics Read more\n\nAfter criticising Ross Barkley’s lack of productivity during the week, Koeman once again left the England international on the bench. His replacement, James McCarthy, looked entirely at sea in a nominal No10 role. Gerard Deulofeu tried hard on the right-hand side, while Kevin Mirallas was anonymous on the left. And these are the players who apparently make Everton more of a footballing side than their opponents.\n\n“The Premier League is not always about football qualities, it’s about physicality, about second balls and in that respect the team is too weak,” Koeman said. “We have too much to do when teams like this play direct and aggressive.\n\n“We have different players, different qualities but in that aspect we have to improve and do better.

In recent seasons Arsenal have had their encouraging moments, but sustaining them into the sharp end of the season has been the tougher trick to pull off. The challenge to maintain this rich form is on.\n\nWatford and Stefano Okaka rally to hold off Everton and Romelu Lukaku Read more\n\nArsenal went a goal behind but surged up a gear to see off Stoke with goals from Theo Walcott, Mesut Özil and Alex Iwobi. While conscious Chelsea can leapfrog them before the weekend is out, it is worth noting that Arsenal have made a habit of playing with inhibitions when the chance to enjoy the summit has presented itself. This time, they relished it. “We are in the fight,” Wenger said.\n\nHe was pleased to point out a game like this epitomised one of the areas of improvement he wanted from his team. “I felt last year at home we did very well against the top five and dropped points against the teams in mid-table, between positions 5-12. That’s our challenge, to continue to do well in this type of game.”\n\nStoke played their part in a competitive tussle. An ambitious start culminated in two chances in the first five minutes, with Marc Muniesa walloping a dangerous long-range volley and a swift break requiring some clever defending to send Xherdan Shaqiri away from a clear sight of goal.\n\nErik Pieters and Joe Allen shanked shooting opportunities and it was clear the home defence were on the back foot.\n\nArsenal’s fortunes took a turn for the worse with two blows in quick succession: first an injury to Shkodran Mustafi, who will be out for three weeks with a hamstring problem. Then Stoke were awarded a penalty. It was a debatable enough decision to leave Wenger seething at the fourth official. Granit Xhaka tangled with Allen as they contested a 50-50 ball and Xhaka caught Allen with a brush of an elbow.\n\n“No foul,” Wenger said. “Joe spilled blood as a consequence of the coming together,” Mark Hughes responded.\n\nCharlie Adam merely got on with the task and, on his 31st birthday, steered calmly and accurately past Petr Cech.\n\nArsenal were not playing with the kind of verve they had been enjoying recently and needed to dig some inspiration from somewhere. It came from a move built on speed – the determination of Alexis Sánchez to instigate a move, quick thought to pick a brilliant pass, the enterprise of Héctor Bellerín to zip in a cross and the sharpness of Walcott to nip ahead of his marker to turn in the ball at Lee Grant’s near post.\n\nIt was Walcott’s 100th goal in his club career and a 10th this season, which triggers a gift from Mrs Walcott of a new coffee machine. Proof that even though Premier League footballers would appear to want for nothing there is still, reassuringly, something on their Christmas lists.\n\nIt did not take long for Arsenal to edge in front after the restart. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain’s beautifully crafted pass found Özil, who had drifted past Stoke’s rearguard. The German arced a deft header over Grant.\n\nHughes was disappointed to see a blip in his team’s defensive organisation as they were readjusting, with Pieters back on the pitch after receiving treatment just as Özil made his decisive run.\n\nStoke did summon a second wind. They had opportunities to test Cech but Marko Arnautovic and Mame Biram Diouf were imprecise with their finishing. As time ticked down Hughes decided to bring on Peter Crouch to ask different questions of Arsenal’s defence. He almost scored with his first touch – a downward header that required an important reflex save from Cech.\n\nAs it turned out, it was an Arsenal substitute who made a key impact. With the game still in the balance, Iwobi cantered into the box after Sánchez had been cluttered on the edge and carefully picked his spot.\n\nHughes tried to be realistic. “I’ve brought teams here in the past and struggled to get out of our own half. There are few times we have created as many chances as we did today,” he said. “We have big away games coming up against Chelsea and Liverpool, so we take away the positives.”\n\nWenger reflected on a perfect week, and the challenge to carry on their good work. Arsenal turn their attention to games at Goodison Park and the Etihad Stadium in positive spirits. “I believe we have improved,” Wenger said. “Let’s keep it in the longer term. We have created confidence, we are ambitious, we have to keep the urgency level very high.”"}, {"date": "10/12/2016", "arena": "Turf Moor", "attendance": 19680, "home_team": {"name": "Burnley", "lineup": [{"name": "Tom Heaton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matthew Lowton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Keane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Mee", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stephen Ward", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [16], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Defour", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [55]}, {"name": "Dean Marney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Scott Arfield", "yellows": [54], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jeff Hendrick", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [13], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "George Boyd", "yellows": [68], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [75], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Sam Vokes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [55]}], "subs": [{"name": "Jon Flanagan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andre Gray", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [55], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Barnes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [55], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Kightly", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Patrick Bamford", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paul Robinson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Tarkowski", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Bournemouth", "lineup": [{"name": "Artur Boruc", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Simon Francis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steve Cook", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathan Aké", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charlie Daniels", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [90], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Smith", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dan Gosling", "yellows": [60], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [72]}, {"name": "Harry Arter", "yellows": [34], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Fraser", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [81]}, {"name": "Benik Afobe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [45], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Callum Wilson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [59]}], "subs": [{"name": "Marc Pugh", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [81], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Brad Smith", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joshua King", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [72], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Federici", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tyrone Mings", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Wilshere", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [59], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordon Ibe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Historic highs tend to be followed by anticlimaxes but for Bournemouth the deflation lay solely in the outcome. The 4-3 win against Liverpool last week was described as the greatest result in their 117-year existence and while the sequel contained similar levels of drama, the result will inspire fewer superlatives in Dorset. When asked if it was good to be back at Turf Moor, the former Burnley manager Eddie Howe simply said: “No.”\n\nHis side illustrated their powers of recovery for a second successive week, rallying again after trailing 2-0 and 3-1, and scored another injury-time goal, but Charlie Daniels’s thunderbolt did not assume the same significance as Nathan Aké’s winner against Liverpool. Howe had further proof of the character in his group but cautioned: “We don’t [just] want to become a team that plays well when chasing the game.”\n\nMesut Özil fires Arsenal past Stoke City and to the top of the table Read more\n\nTheir conquerors are a side who can be relied upon to perform well at Turf Moor. Only Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham can boast more points at home, enabling Burnley to end a run of three consecutive defeats and take a step into mid-table. The win was rendered memorable by Jeff Hendrick’s opener. When Matt Lowton fed the ball forward, the midfielder took one touch to control the ball and his second was a stunning, dipping half-volley that flew past Artur Boruc.\n\n“It is just a shame we aren’t Arsenal so it won’t be shown 1,000 times, just four,” the Burnley manager, Sean Dyche, said.\n\nBurnley’s first goal was fantastic, their second altogether more prosaic but they had another Irish scorer within four minutes. Stephen Ward ended an 1,804-day wait for a Premier League strike after Boruc had clawed Ben Mee’s header off the line. “Criminal,” Howe said, annoyed that Mee was left unmarked. “We started well and found ourselves 2-0 down very quickly.”\n\nIt is a familiar situation. The response was typical. Rewarded for his catalytic cameo against Liverpool with a start, Ryan Fraser was Bournemouth’s brightest player, mixing mesmeric runs with astute passes. Another Howe promotion also justified his selection. Benik Afobe marked his first league start of the season with a first top-flight goal since March, converting Simon Francis’s stoppage-time cross to conclude a move the quick-witted Fraser began and which Dyche clocked. “I don’t know where the time comes from,” he said. “One minute was added and my watch said 1.17.” The invigorated Afobe then missed a fine chance to level and had a goal disallowed and played with the hunger of a man desperate for an opportunity.\n\nBurnley, though, also showed appetite and intent. Their positivity was epitomised by their manager. Rather than being cowed by Liverpool’s inability to defend a lead against Bournemouth, Dyche went on the offensive, sending on two strikers and, albeit indirectly,sealing victory.\n\nAshley Barnes almost scored with his first touch and could have had a brace within 10 minutes of his introduction. Andre Gray also proved profligate but redeemed himself with an inventive backheel to release George Boyd, who drilled in Burnley’s third goal.\n\n“We can be effective from the bench,” Dyche said. “I don’t think we had the depth two years ago. We do now.” And so Burnley, who mustered a mere 14 home league goals during their last stint in the Premier League, equalled that tally in early December. Dyche said: “I was really pleased not just with the amount of chances but golden chances.”"}, {"date": "10/12/2016", "arena": "KCOM Stadium", "attendance": 17403, "home_team": {"name": "Hull City",

sufficient to pacify Crystal Palace’s critical American investors after his side once again displayed extreme defensive vulnerability.\n\nFernando Llorente double steers Swansea to vital win over Sunderland Read more\n\nWith Tom Huddlestone back to something approaching his imperious best in central midfield, Hull would have won had Fraizer Campbell not rescued Palace courtesy of an 89th-minute equaliser as Pardew made his first return to this ground since he infamously butted David Meyler here in March 2014.\n\nReunited, he and Meyler, a home substitute, maintained a safe distance but their measured interaction proved just about the only restrained thing about a thrilling afternoon spiced by stellar goals and kamikaze defending.\n\n“It was more open than I’d have liked,” said Pardew, who had Zaha to thank for scoring a goal-of-the-season contender and then creating Campbell’s late equaliser. “But it was a good point for us – we’re happy to take it.”\n\nHull remain second bottom, three points behind Palace, but their wonderfully spirited performance left the manager, Mike Phelan, torn between joy and sorrow. “I thought we were going to get a massive win,” Phelan said. “We played some excellent football but it’s ended with disappointment and a bit of negativity.”\n\nEndeavouring to arrest a run of eight defeats in 10 Premier League games, Phelan reverted to 3-5-2 and relocated Robert Snodgrass from the right wing to an outright attacking role alongside Adama Diomandé.\n\nIt would prove an exciting blueprint but was almost ripped up within minutes. Palace threatened to assume an early lead when, cutting in from the right, Zaha sashayed his way beyond three markers before unleashing a low, angled shot, finger-tipped away for a corner by David Marshall.\n\nReprieved, Hull settled into a reasonably convincing passing rhythm and Wayne Hennessey could find no answer to Snodgrass’s impeccably executed left‑footed penalty.\n\nIt was awarded after he took a tumble in the face of Scott Dann. Mike Jones, the referee, bought it but there had been no contact and even Snodgrass’s biggest fans would acknowledge he was lucky not to be booked for diving. Indeed considering the Scotland creator had just been handed a yellow card for tugging at Christian Benteke’s shirt, Hull’s most gifted player was rather fortunate not to have been sent off.\n\nWith the hood of his club anorak pulled up in the face of driving rain, Pardew seemed a study in misery. He retains the support of Steve Parish, his chairman, but Josh Harris and David Blitzer, Palace’s two key American backers, were unimpressed to hear the manager talk about “investors who don’t know a lot about football” following the 3-0 win against Southampton last week.\n\nThat victory ended a run of six successive defeats and Pardew’s mission here was to provide further proof of revival; to emphasise why he should not be replaced by Sam Allardyce. The necessary evidence ultimately appeared contradictory and looked a little thin on the ground as Hull began the second half brightly but then divine retribution – or might it have been the referee’s guilty conscience? – intervened and Snodgrass conceded a soft penalty for tripping Zaha. Up stepped Benteke, his nonchalant side-foot sending Marshall the wrong way.\n\nPardew had switched to a back three and must have thought everything was going to plan when a partially cleared corner fell to Zaha. After delighting in changing pace, switching feet and bamboozling Sam Clucas, he lashed a sublime shot beyond Marshall.\n\nAlmost instantly, the Palace manager’s smile faded as Diomandé’s sharp, clever turn wrong-footed Damien Delaney before the striker nutmegged Dann and dinked the ball past Hennessey to claim his first goal in 13 games.\n\nNot content with levelling matters, Hull regained the lead after Jake Livermore rounded off a one-two with the influential Snodgrass by squeezing a superlative shot partly facilitated by atrocious defending from Dann and Yohan Cabaye inside a post.\n\nShortly afterwards came a costly miss featuring Clucas heading marginally wide, which set the scene for Campbell’s connection with Zaha’s last-gasp cross.

Liberty Stadium as Fernando Llorente scored twice for the second home game in succession to lift them off the bottom of the Premier League and out of the relegation zone on a perfect day for Bob Bradley and his players.\n\nIt was just the sort of result Bradley needed after a difficult week in which the manager has faced questions about his future after two months in the job. With Steve Kaplan and Jason Levien, the club’s majority shareholders, looking on from the directors’ box together for only the second time this season, an emphatic home victory provided the best possible response and buried the memory of the drubbing at Tottenham.\n\nFraizer Campbell’s late leveller rescues Crystal Palace after Hull heroics Read more\n\nGylfi Sigurdsson was outstanding again as he scored the first and created the second, meaning the Icelander has been directly involved in eight goals in his last eight Premier League appearances. Yet there were impressive performances all over the pitch, with Leon Britton and Jay Fulton catching the eye in central midfield and Llorente showing what a difference a little bit of confidence can make to a striker.\n\nDavid Moyes described the controversial penalty Sigurdsson converted early in the second half to give Swansea the lead as the turning point and it was easy to sympathise with the Sunderland manager’s frustration about what looked like a soft decision, with Jason Denayer adjudged to have handled Wayne Routledge’s cross. Yet Moyes knew he could have no complaints about the result.\n\nSwansea were superior in every department in the second half. It was not until the 80th minute that Lukasz Fabianski had a serious save to make, when the Swansea goalkeeper tipped Papy Djilobodji’s header on to the bar, and by then the game was well beyond Sunderland, who are now bottom again after three wins in four had improved their standing.\n\nFor Swansea, the table makes for much better reading. “It’s a nice bonus,” Bradley said, reflecting on a win that helped them climb three places. “We can’t get ahead of ourselves. The word that many players used when we talked this week was ‘pride’. The only thing I did was try to get back at them and say: ‘What does pride look like actually on the pitch?’ Pride has to turn into intensity. Pride has to turn into clean sheets. Don’t just talk about it, put it into something more. So for me, those kind of things are first and then at the end of all that, for a few seconds, you can look at the table and say: ‘We’re not there yet, but that looks better than it did last week and let’s see if we can continue to move things forward.’”\n\nBradley acknowledged the first goal was always going to be crucial, with Swansea confidence brittle after their 5-0 defeat at White Hart Lane, and on another day Jermain Defoe may well have opened the scoring. The former England striker broke away on a couple of occasions but he blazed the first chance over and the second wide.\n\nThe significance of that second opportunity became clear 60 seconds later when Craig Pawson, the referee, pointed to the spot after Denayer tried to block Routledge’s cross. “I think it’s too close to give a penalty-kick,” Moyes said. “I think the boy goes with his foot, turns his back and it hits him on his arm. So I think that was harsh and it turns the game.”\n\nSigurdsson dispatched his penalty and it was as if a switch had been flicked, as confidence surged through Swansea. Two minutes later Sigurdsson released Modou Barrow and the Gambian drilled in a low shot that Jordan Pickford, who was Sunderland’s best player by a distance, turned around the post.\n\nThere was nothing Pickford could do to stop the goal Swansea scored from the corner that followed. In a well-worked routine, Sigurdsson slid a low corner into the area and Llorente timed his run perfectly to sweep home a first-time shot.\n\nSwansea were in total control and only an outstanding piece of goalkeeping from Pickford denied the home team a third. Once again Sigurdsson was the architect, his curling free-kick from the right picking out Jordi Amat, whose twisting header was expertly tipped over by Pickford.\n\nSunderland were unable to stem the tide and it was no surprise when Swansea scored again. Jefferson Montero broke down the left, skirted around the full-back Billy Jones and floated over a cross that implored Llorente to head in his second and put a smile on the face of Bradley in the process.\n\n“Today is a step but we have to build on it,” the Swansea manager said."}, {"date": "10/12/2016", "arena": "The King Power Stadium", "attendance": 31966, "home_team": {"name": "Leicester

and it was Manchester City who looked bogus. Jamie Vardy scored a hat-trick and Andy King one goal as Claudio Ranieri’s men blew away a Pep Guardiola side who lacked the mettle to go with their frilly pretensions. Aleksandar Kolarov and Nolito’s late goals did not mask that.\n\nSnow machines and reindeers gladdened the atmosphere outside the ground before the kick-off and by the end the home fans were singing with festive cheer, while Guardiola was facing questions about the need for new resolutions.\n\nRiyad Mahrez finds perfect opportunity to show off all his creative beauty | Barney Ronay Read more\n\nLeicester have struggled in the defence of their title, unable to recapture their verve or to prevent opponents from subduing their well-known strengths. But City appeared to make no allowance for the champions’ abilities and were found wanting physically and tactically. They were ideal opponents for a Leicester side in need of a confidence boost.\n\nThey came into the game hoping to begin jilting comparison with Manchester City’s class of 1938, the only English champions to be relegated the season after winning the title. Just as City were shorn of the suspended Fernandinho and Sergio Agüero, Leicester were deprived of Danny Drinkwater – and the lifeless midweek performance by fringe players in Porto seemingly persuaded Ranieri he was also deprived of a plan B, as he redeployed the players who had started the 2-1 defeat at Sunderland. They were too strong for City.\n\nRanieri has admitted “we are missing everything from last season”, but here his team recaptured their magic. It took only three minutes. Leicester opened the scoring after Robert Huth powered a header forward and Riyad Mahrez helped it on with a delicious flick to Islam Slimani, who threaded a pass through to Vardy. The striker, showing no evidence of a loss of confidence following 16 club games without a goal, lashed a low drive across Claudio Bravo and into the bottom corner.\n\nTwo minutes later Leicester increased their lead. Again Huth and Slimani were instrumental, the former heading on a throw-in to the latter, who laid the ball back to Andy King at the edge of the area. The midfielder struck it first time into the top corner. Bravo’s effort to stop it was as unconvincing as the defence in front of him.\n\nLeicester were playing with the vibrancy they have lacked while the visitors were defending feebly, as if surprised by the onslaught. They were especially discombobulated when Huth ventured into the box. In the 12th minute the German headed another long throw from Christian Fuchs on to Slimani, who volleyed wide from eight yards. City, intricately going nowhere, forced Ron-Robert Zieler to make his first save in the 19th minute.\n\nPep Guardiola may tweak tactics after Leicester beat Manchester City Read more\n\nOne minute later Leicester forced Bravo to pick the ball out of the net for the third time thanks to a move of simple brilliance. Fuchs found Mahrez with a long pass from the back and the Algerian put Vardy through with another exquisite first-time pass. “Unbelievable – only he can do this,” Ranieri said. “Another player would have stopped the ball and lost momentum.” Vardy applied the finish the pass deserved, racing around Bravo and scoring.\n\nCity could not cope with Leicester’s energy and directness and at times seemed confused by their own highfalutin scheming, with Pablo Zabaleta’s wandering role a particular puzzle. It is not anti-intellectual to suggest they were trying to recite poetry before showing they had learned their ABC.\n\nCity hogged possession for the remainder of the first half but failed to penetrate Leicester’s defence and remained naively exposed to counterattacks. Slimani should have made it 4-0 before the break but headed wide from eight yards as City’s defenders stood flummoxed.\n\nGuardiola made no changes at half-time. Nor did Leicester, obviously. Within five minutes City mounted a bigger threat than they had managed in the first period but Kelechi Iheanacho failed to connect with a cross from Jesús Navas. The youngster was not making the most of his rare opportunity to start instead of Agüero.\n\nLeicester City 4-2 Manchester City: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nRanieri pumped his fists and hollered on the sidelines, exhorting his players to maintain their concentration and dynamism as City probed. Swift, imaginative interplay – yes, City did some of that – took them into Leicester’s penalty area just before the hour, before Iheanacho teed up Ilkay Gündogan, who shot wide from 18 yards. Guardiola then figured his team needed new impetus, so introduced Raheem Sterling and Yaya Touré.\n\nZabaleta popped up on the edge of the right-hand corner of Leicester’s area in the 62nd minute and curled a shot narrowly wide. Then, up at the other end, Slimani barged past two defenders and forced a save from Bravo.\n\nCity lurched further into farce in the 78th minute, as John Stones blithely played a back pass without looking. Vardy inflicted suitable punishment on his England colleague, intercepting and netting from an acute angle. Kolarov expertly converted a free-kick four minutes later, and crossed for Nolito to score from close range before the end, but those were footnotes in a story of renewed glory for Leicester and

Dispatched to Humberside on loan by Southampton two years ago, the Uruguayan struggled with injuries and poor form, and it took a transfer to Teesside to help restore him to former glories.\n\nAnd Ramírez, once again emphasising his importance to Aitor Karanka’s gameplan, headed in a winner to lift Middlesbrough four points clear of the relegation zone and towards mid-table security.\n\nMiddlesbrough v Hull City: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nIt left an unambitious Hull, who restricted a dominant Boro to few clear-cut chances but created next to none of their own, second from bottom and heading into a bitter night with their future as unclear as the fog-shrouded roads leading south to Humberside. “We controlled the game,” said Karanka, for whom it was only a third victory of the season. “It was a really good win, beating Hull was massive. They’re really well organised but we showed we were better than them.”\n\nPhelan did not entirely disagree. “We were under severe pressure but I thought we defended well,” the Hull manager said. “With better decision-making we could possibly have got a point.”\n\nAs the mist began rolling in from the Tees, a cagey opening filled with backwards and sideways passes was briefly enlivened when Álvaro Negredo met Marten de Roon’s lay-off. Twelve yards out, the striker was slackly marked but, perhaps unwisely, he elected to shoot with the outside of his left foot when he seemed to have time to shift it on to the right. Unsurprisingly, the shot arced high over the bar.\n\nDavid Marshall, Hull’s keeper, has one of Víctor Valdés’s old Barcelona jerseys hidden away in his garage. It is a souvenir from the night in 2004 the then youthful Celtic keeper was part of the team who won a Uefa Cup match against Barça, and he seemed minded to perform a few more heroics here. Having reacted well to save Ramírez’s low 25-yard shot and then divert a similar effort from Adam Forshaw, he initially proved adept at it.\n\nBoro’s improvement in recent weeks has been largely attributable to Karanka’s installation of his other Barcelona old boy, Adama Traoré, wide on the right, and the winger’s demotion to the bench raised eyebrows. His place was taken by Viktor Fischer, who thought he had scored after turning the ball home following Ramírez’s cross and Negredo’s headed flick only to see the effort rightly disallowed for a combination of offside and handball.\n\nNo matter; Karanka’s players were very much in control. They appeared almost affronted when Hull finally escaped their half and looked unprepared for Adama Diomandé’s acceleration on to Markus Henriksen’s pass. Then, just as Diomandé, shaped to shoot, Ben Gibson slid in to retrieve the situation with a perfectly timed, brilliantly executed tackle. “Ben Gibson, he’s one of our own,” chorused the Teesside crowd as Steve Gibson, the club’s owner and the centre-half’s uncle, looked on approvingly.\n\nBehind the smiles, Gibson Sr might have been a little concerned by Boro’s failure to translate superiority into goals, the moment when Fischer’s inviting delivery struck a startled Negredo on the side of the head seeming symbolic of their attacking travails. Significantly, that was a rare cross from a home player and maybe a few more would not have gone amiss.\n\nPossibly this dearth of centres was down to Ramírez being used as much more of a playmaking No10 than a winger. It also had something to do with Fischer’s struggles to get beyond Ahmed Elmohamady but philosophy comes into it too; Karanka wants to play in a more between-the-lines way.\n\nOn Monday, though, Hull’s five-man midfield made fluency difficult in the freezing air, though the game finally defrosted 15 minutes into a second half full of home dominance when a set piece rescued Boro. Fischer’s corner found Ramírez totally unmarked at the far post and his glancing header defied Marshall. Industry personified, the Uruguayan deserved his moment.\n\nPhelan’s side immediately became more expansive after Ryan Mason and Jake Livermore were withdrawn and Tom Huddlestone and the young Jarrod Bowen were introduced. And after Ramírez hobbled off with a minor injury, Hull suddenly prompted panic for Boro.\n\nTheir new-found sense of adventure resulted in Valdés saving brilliantly from Diomandé in stoppage time. Connecting with Robert Snodgrass’s ensuing corner, the lone striker then poked the ball narrowly wide. Next Valdés directed a clearance straight at Snodgrass but he could not quite take advantage. “We don’t have great resources,” Phelan said. “We know it’s going to be difficult – but this will not kill our sense of belief.”"}, {"date": "04/12/2016", "arena": "Vitality Stadium", "attendance": 11183, "home_team": {"name": "Bournemouth", "lineup": [{"name": "Artur Boruc", "yellows": [], "reds": [],

occasions as gloriously madcap as this when Liverpool’s credentials as title challengers are suddenly rendered flimsy. There were long periods of this enthralling contest when the visitors threatened to overrun their hosts en route to comfortable success and yet, from a position of dominance, they still contrived to end up as victims of arguably the greatest result in Bournemouth’s history. “It’s a wonderful story if you’re not part of it on the wrong side,” Jürgen Klopp said through a rueful grin. “Today that’s where we were.”\n\nBournemouth 4-3 Liverpool: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nThe tale defied belief. There were shades of Selhurst Park and that infamous night dubbed ‘Cry-stanbul’ in the finale to Liverpool’s title pursuit under Brendan Rodgers three seasons ago in the way this team unravelled. All those defensive frailties often cited as cause for concern but usually masked by rampant attacking play reared ugly in the frantic last 14 minutes here as the visitors saw a 3-1 lead transformed into a deficit in the third minute of stoppage time.\n\nA 15-match unbeaten run was wrecked amid the bedlam. Once the delirium in the stands had died down home supporters queued in the aisles to take photographs of the big screens displaying the scoreline. The visitors could not leave soon enough.\n\nThe sloppiness of the decisive seventh goal summed it all up. Liverpool were still cursing half-chances spurned by Divock Origi and Adam Lallana at the other end when they found themselves pinned back deep inside their own half by their hosts’ late forward thrust. There was Steve Cook, a centre-half loitering high in enemy territory, gathering and spitting a shot at goal that bounced just in front of Loris Karius and was duly spilled out by the goalkeeper. In charged Nathan Aké, who had started the afternoon as the hosts’ other centre-back, to prod a shot through the goalkeeper and smuggle the ball over the line. In another of the afternoon’s many subplots the Dutchman is on loan from the leaders, Chelsea, who are now four points ahead of Liverpool. Momentum has shifted.\n\nKlopp claimed not to be angry and even seemed to accept there will occasionally be days such as this in his first full season in charge. Privately, however, he will have been alarmed at the way this game veered away. They were undone largely by Ryan Fraser, a 22-year-old Scot who spent last season on loan at Ipswich Town and, having started only two top-flight games this season, was flung on in hope rather than expectation for the injured Junior Stanislas 10 minutes after the break. The diminutive winger was inspirational, forever charging head down at his markers and injecting such energy into his team’s approach. It was as if Liverpool had never been confronted by such intent, bamboozled as they were by Fraser’s pace and invention. The recovery was born of his arrival.\n\nFraser’s first involvement was to reach a loose ball just ahead of James Milner in the box and stumble under the full-back’s touch, a penalty award that left Klopp livid on the sidelines. Callum Wilson dispatched the spot-kick, wrecking the visitors’ hopes of keeping four successive clean sheets for the first time since early 2011 in the process. Emre Can restored the visitors’ two-goal lead in the moments that followed, curling in a fantastic shot from the excellent Sadio Mané’s pull-back, but the locals spied reward whenever Fraser was on the gallop. “The manager just told me to bring a bit of life back into the game,” the £400,000 signing from Aberdeen said. His 35-minute cameo would end with the home support bellowing his name and the sponsors’ man-of-the-match award waiting pitch-side.\n\nIt was in the final 14 minutes when Liverpool truly caved in. Jack Wilshere, increasingly influential amid the frenzy all around, robbed Origi on the edge of the Bournemouth penalty area and the substitutes Benik Afobe and Fraser countered at pace. The ball was eventually shifted to Wilson and the move ended with Fraser curling his first Bournemouth goal for almost two years into the corner. Karius was helpless there, although indecision had long since gripped the visitors’ backline. The clock had crept on only another three minutes when Dejan Lovren failed to gain proper purchase on a clearing header and Fraser, fed by Wilshere, delivered once more from the right. Cook, with his back to goal, instinctively collected the ball on the stretch, spun and dispatched the equaliser through the clutter.\n\nThe grizzled defender, who has risen through the divisions with this club, actually has a reputation as a canny finisher but even he must have surprised himself with the slick nature of that reward. Eddie Howe said: “After we’d gained promotion we were desperate not to lose the togetherness, the never-say-die attitude and commitment which had got us to the Premier League. Money can harm that but this is evidence we’ve maintained that spirit and, if anything, harnessed it. That bodes well for the future.”\n\nRyan Fraser inspires Bournemouth’s madcap turnaround against Liverpool | Barney Ronay Read more\n\nComebacks such as this are testimony to the conviction he has instilled in this squad. By the end it was hard to contemplate just how dominant Liverpool had once been up to Fraser’s arrival, swarming all over panicked opponents in that familiar, oppressive manner. They had led by two at the break, courtesy first of Artur Boruc’s indecision and, subsequently, his desperate desire to make amends. Can’s lofted pass beyond Aké might have been suffocated by the Pole but his hesitation proved critical as Mané touched his finish delicately beyond the onrushing goalkeeper.\n\nBoruc was no doubt still contemplating that mistake moments later when he charged out of his area hoping to repel Jordan Henderson’s pass down the right only for that, too, to prove a horrible misjudgment. Origi was always likely to reach the ball first and one touch took him round the goalkeeper before a finish thumped home emphatically from a narrow angle. Cook, retreating too late to the post, could only puff out his cheeks in resignation. His afternoon and Bournemouth’s would improve dramatically before the end."}, {"date": "04/12/2016", "arena": "Goodison Park", "attendance": 39550, "home_team": {"name": "Everton", "lineup": [{"name": "Maarten Stekelenburg", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Seamus Coleman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [67]}, {"name": "Ashley Williams", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ramiro Funes Mori", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leighton Baines", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [89], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yannick Bolasie", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [68]}, {"name": "Idrissa Gueye", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gareth Barry", "yellows": [31], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Cleverley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [65]}, {"name": "Romelu Lukaku", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin Mirallas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Joel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Jagielka", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gerard Deulofeu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [65], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ross Barkley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James McCarthy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Enner Valencia", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [68], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mason Holgate", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [67], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Manchester United", "lineup": [{"name": "David De Gea", "yellows": [88], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Antonio Valencia", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Jones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marcos Rojo", "yellows": [16], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matteo Darmian", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ander Herrera", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Carrick", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paul Pogba", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Henrikh Mkhitaryan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [85]}, {"name": "Zlatan Ibrahimovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [42], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Anthony Martial", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [83]}], "subs": [{"name": "Eric Bailly", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Juan Mata", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jesse Lingard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daley Blind", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marcus Rashford", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [83], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sergio Romero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marouane Fellaini", "yellows": [88], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [85], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Closing out tight Premier League contests, squeezing the options and then the hope out of the opposition; what was once the art of José Mourinho is lost for now to Manchester United and their increasingly irascible manager.\n\nFive minutes remained at an anxious Goodison Park when Mourinho replaced Henrikh Mkhitaryan with Marouane Fellaini. Two minutes later the shut‑up‑shop substitute carelessly conceded a penalty against his former club and victory, much-needed evidence of progress and Mourinho’s tactical renown had slipped away once again. At least the water bottles escaped a good kicking.\n\nJosé Mourinho sticks to script after Manchester United draw at Everton Read more\n\nThe United manager went full-Arsène Wenger after his side’s fourth draw in five Premier League matches, claiming not to have witnessed Fellaini’s foul on Idrissa Gana Gueye that enabled Everton to equalise in the 89th minute, or Marcos Rojo’s two-footed tackle on the same player that could so easily have brought a first-half dismissal. He did claim to have seen another “very good performance” from the visitors and another undeserved scoreline, one that leaves United sixth in the table and nine points off fourth place, but that was stretching it. Throughout, this was a contest that reflected the mediocre form of the two teams – it is now one win in nine league games for Everton and one in eight for United – and the draw should have brooked little argument.\n\nLeighton Baines drilled the late spot‑kick beyond David de Gea’s right hand to salvage a point for Ronald Koeman’s side, just as Olivier Giroud and Joe Allen had done for Arsenal and Stoke City respectively in fightbacks at Old Trafford. United’s problems are not confined to home, it appears.\n\nThey were gifted an interval lead by the Everton goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg and went close to extending their advantage when Ander Herrera struck a post from close range in the second half. But there was a lack of conviction and confidence to United’s attacking play and it was Everton who dictated much of the game after the restart. Fellaini’s calamitous cameo – his errors were not limited to the penalty – merely reinforced the sense of a side missing leadership and know-how.\n\n“We did not deserve to lose,” Koeman said. “From the start we played with really good defensive organisation and made it really difficult for United to create. We showed fighting spirit.”\n\nNeither team posed a threat until Stekelenburg’s rush of blood gifted Zlatan Ibrahimovic his fourth goal in three league games. It was a committed contest, a little too committed in Rojo’s case, but there was a painful lack of craft in attacking areas. The deficiency would have come as a greater surprise to Mourinho than Koeman given United’s impressive midweek display against West Ham in the EFL Cup and Everton’s ineffective recent form.\n\nEverton responded to their manager’s call for more aggression but were left with a legitimate grievance when Rojo crossed that line with a dangerous challenge on Gueye. The ball was there to be won after a loose touch from Herrera but while Gueye executed a clean tackle, the Argentina international lunged in with both feet, studs showing, and caught ball and man. It looked a red-card offence in real time but the referee, Michael Oliver, opted for yellow despite having an unobstructed view. Rojo was fortunate in the extreme and the same was true of Gueye, who was able to continue. Koeman said: “It was difficult for the referee. Maybe if the referee watches it back he will think red card.”\n\nOliver had set a lenient tone earlier on when failing to book Gareth Barry for a late foul from behind on Ibrahimovic. Not that one error justified a second and Barry, Everton’s captain with Phil Jagielka unsurprisingly dropped to the bench, went in the book for persistent misconduct inside half an hour.\n\nHenrikh Mkhitaryan finally makes case as a Manchester United player | Jamie Jackson Read more\n\nNo red for Rojo looked set to be the only first-half incident of note when United conjured a goal out of nothing. Mourinho’s team had lacked the precision and urgency of their midweek display – it may not tally with recent obituaries but the suspended Wayne Rooney was missed – yet edged ahead when Stekelenburg managed to turn a routine long ball into a glorious invitation for Ibrahimovic.\n\nThe United centre-forward set off in pursuit of Matteo Darmian’s pass over the top alongside Ramiro Funes Mori. Inexplicably, so did the Everton keeper and the Swede seized the invitation to lob Stekelenburg outside his penalty area, the ball striking the crossbar and crossing the line before Funes Mori was able to clear.\n\nEverton lost Séamus Coleman and Yannick Bolasie to injury in quick succession but with their replacements all immediately up to pace with the game, unlike Fellaini, the home team gathered momentum in the second half.

They rode their luck at times – discounting the own goal from Gary Cahill – and their opponents were entitled to be aggrieved about some of the refereeing decisions. Yet nobody could question the endurance of Antonio Conte’s men, their competitive courage and the tactical acumen of their manager.\n\nManchester City’s lack of mental edge exposed in Pep Guardiola challenge | Paul Wilson Read more\n\nUnfortunately for them, the occasion will be remembered more for the collective lack of discipline in stoppage time when City, to put it bluntly, lost the plot. Sergio Agüero, having already served one suspension this season, can expect a four-game ban after his scything red-card challenge on David Luiz. That, however, told only part of the story as the two sets of players clashed by the touchline and Fernandinho could be in serious trouble after reacting to some provocation from Cesc Fàbregas by grabbing him by the neck, levering him towards the crowd and eventually pushing him over the advertising hoardings almost into the laps of the front row of spectators.\n\nFernandinho wanted to prolong the argument even after being sent off and he, and City, might face further action when the Football Association studies the video replays and sees how stewards had to prevent it getting even more out of hand. Chelsea could also be fined given the number of players from the sides locking horns. To put it into context, the managers felt compelled to go on the pitch and Diego Costa, of all people, could be seen trying to calm down Fernandinho. Guardiola did at least recognise it was a shabby way to end the match – “I would like to apologise,” he said – but he was pushing his luck trying to argue that Agüero’s wild, two-footed challenge was not intentional and his own conduct was questionable, to say the least.\n\nPep Guardiola sorry for City fracas but refuses to lay blame on Sergio Agüero Read more\n\nAt one point, late in the game, Guardiola could be seen sarcastically clapping the referee, Anthony Taylor, for giving City a free-kick, even punching the air and sticking up his thumbs to give his act an extra flourish. Guardiola insisted that he would never be disrespectful about referees in press conferences, but he had already done just that in front of a television audience stretching to millions. As for his apology, it was hardly uttered in the manner of someone who genuinely felt contrition or embarrassment. He was seething, no matter how determined he was not to criticise Agüero or Fernandinho directly.\n\nIt was a breathless contest, laced with controversy, and in fairness to City they did have legitimate complaints, in particular the first-half incident when David Luiz could feasibly have been sent off for halting Agüero’s run towards goal. City were also denied two penalty appeals in the opening 45 minutes and Taylor spent large parts of the game with an incensed crowd reminding him of his alleged boyhood allegiances to Manchester United.\n\nUltimately, though, there was a reminder here that Guardiola’s team are going to find it difficult to win the league when they defend with so little cohesion. City have kept two clean sheets in the league and having taken the lead it must have been startling for their manager to see how they unravelled in the face of Chelsea’s superb counterattacking.\n\nCosta began the comeback on the hour and the next two goals came from the kind of breakaway attacks that have exposed City on several occasions this season. At least there was some form of mitigation for Eden Hazard’s goal, with the clock ticking down and the home side left with no choice but to advance in numbers. Yet, from one penalty area to the other, Chelsea opened them up in a matter of seconds when the substitute Willian ran clear to give the visitors the lead. Chelsea played with the better structure, the clearer heads and a greater understanding of the wing-back system employed by both sides.\n\nHazard’s late finish confirmed an eighth successive league win, Chelsea’s best run for 10 years in a single season and that made it a desperately disappointing afternoon for City bearing in mind the home team led at half-time and had a golden opportunity, two minutes before Costa’s equaliser, to double their lead. Kevin De Bruyne could not keep his shot down, the ball came back off the crossbar and the remainder of the match merely re-iterated that Guardiola is still to get the balance right between attack and defence.\n\nManchester City 1-3 Chelsea: Premier League – live! Read more\n\nMore than anything, City will look back to what happened on the half-hour mark when De Bruyne’s long pass sent Agüero chasing after two defenders and César Azpilicueta’s attempt to play the ball back to Thibaut Courtois fell short. Agüero would have fancied his chances in a sprint against David Luiz and his opponent seemed to realise it, leaning in with sufficient force to unbalance the striker, but also applying enough disguise to get away with it.\n\nThat was a key moment because if the free-kick had been given the next decision for Taylor would have been whether Agüero, running in diagonally 30 yards from goal, had been denied a clear scoring opportunity and, if so, Chelsea would have been down to 10 men.\n\nTaylor had already given Cahill the benefit of the doubt after a handball inside the penalty area and the volume turned up again when N’Golo Kanté got away with a challenge on Ilkay Gündogan. Cahill’s own goal came shortly afterwards and Agüero might consider, on reflection, that Chelsea’s centre-half had suffered enough indignity without rubbing it in by patting him on his head as he ran away in celebration. Jesús Navas had supplied the cross and as own-goals go this one was spectacular – a twisting volley to redirect the ball beneath the joint of crossbar and post.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Fernandinho, right, starts to grab and push Chelsea’s Cesc Fàbregas, leading to a red card for the Manchester City man.

What a difference a 3-0 victory makes.\n\nLeicester City woe mounts as Robert Huth gifts Sunderland a lift Read more\n\nAn unspectacular but well-organised win over Southampton gave Palace their first three points in the Premier League since September. It also brought an end to a run of six straight defeats and earned the Eagles their first clean sheet of the season.\n\nTwo goals from Christian Benteke bookended a rare strike from James Tomkins, but according to Pardew the victory had been made possible by a lively week on the training ground.\n\nReports before the game had suggested that Palace’s players had taken control of Friday’s final training session, so desperate were they for defensive drills. Pardew denied insurrection but confirmed he and his players had found a shared appetite for solidity.\n\n“We had a training session on Thursday that was the complete opposite of today. Sometimes you need that on the training ground,” he said. “You’ve got frustration: we were tight, giving the ball away in our team play.\n\n“On Friday, it wasn’t so much the team wanted defensive work, they needed it. At times, when you’re getting the criticism you’re getting, it’s like your favourite peanut butter or something – you long for it. They longed for defensive work and I wasn’t going to let them down.”\n\nPardew stressed that defensive solidity had been “the only box to tick” in this match. That was borne out by a team selection that brought Damien Delaney and Joe Ledley back into the side. Ledley’s energy disrupted Southampton’s normally smooth passing game but it was Delaney who made the difference. The Republic of Ireland international used all of his 35 years’ experience in a performance that was as intelligent as it was combative.\n\n“He’d be the first to admit he’s not blessed with masses of talent,” said Pardew of his centre-half, “But he’s got masses of personality, of desire and of leadership. The back four was better for having him in it today.”\n\nAfter a cagey opening to the game, Palace took the lead in the 33rd minute thanks to a gift from the pitch and from Fraser Forster.\n\nSouthampton were in possession and, as is their wont, had pushed their defensive line up high. The right back Cédric Soares found himself under pressure on the halfway line and turned the ball backwards, forcing José Fonte to chase the ball back to his own corner flag. The Portuguese then tried to play a simple back pass to Forster but it lacked enough power to reach the keeper, himself under pressure from Benteke. As Forster approached to clear, the ball hit a divot, spinning up and over his clearing boot. Benteke gathered the ball and needed no invitation to turn it home.\n\nGiven recent events that include last week’s 5-4 surrender at Swansea, Palace’s opening goal was not a cause for wild celebration at Selhurst Park. But, two minutes later, the fans allowed themselves to erupt as the home side doubled their lead.\n\nA deep free-kick was launched into the box – a consistent tactic from the home side – and was cleared behind by Fonte. Jason Puncheon opted to drill the corner low across the box, which caused chaos in the Saints backline. After two deflections, the ball fell to Tomkins, who could barely believe his luck. He hit his shot at Forster but still the ball squirmed into the net.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest James Tomkins celebrates after scoring Crystal Palace’s second goal in a crucial win for Alan Pardew. Photograph: Peter Nicholls/Reuters\n\nFrom that point on Saints dominated possession but clearcut chances were few and far between. Charlie Austin should have done better with a near-post header, while substitute Shane Long saw his first touch, also a header, turned wide by Wayne Hennessey. But Palace, led by Delaney and their captain, Scott Dann, stood strong under the pressure. With four minutes of the match remaining the Eagles wrapped it up, Puncheon’s alertness to a deflected shot embarrassing the Saints defence. His cut-back provided Benteke with a second finish only marginally more difficult than his first.\n\nClaude Puel blamed his side’s defeat as much on the state of the Selhurst Park turf as anything else, though this will no doubt be born of frustration at his side’s inability to deliver a win that could have cemented their place in the top half of the table. “It was the bad pitch that gave opportunities to the opponent,” he said.\n\n“It’s not an excuse for us; we did not play well in the first half. But to play the second half on a bad pitch against a team that was 2-0 up was impossible.”"}, {"date": "03/12/2016", "arena": "Bet365 Stadium", "attendance": 27306, "home_team": {"name": "Stoke City",

It’s his first goal in the Premier League so we’re absolutely delighted.\n\n“It’s been frustrating for him because I haven’t given him a lot of game time – but that’s two games back to back and, as always, he’s never let me down. He’s always played at a high level.”\n\nIt was a fifth defeat in six on the road for Burnley, who have taken just one point on their travels compared with 13 in east Lancashire, and Sean Dyche urged his team to get more streetwise, having been punished in the buildup to the second goal.\n\nAfter Stephen Ward played the ball out to allow Walters to receive treatment, Charlie Adam returned it to them only via a throw-in deep in their own half, with a Stoke goal arriving less than one minute later.\n\n“We’ve got to learn more about the Premier League,” Dyche said.\n\n“I thought the gamesmanship was on show. I think they do it way better than we do– we’re still a bit green.\n\n“We’re too honest at times for this division, more so than any other, I think. That’s part of our growth – understanding the game through gamesmanship.”\n\nWest Brom give Tony Pulis solace with breezy win over 10-man Watford Read more"}, {"date": "03/12/2016", "arena": "Stadium

on Claudio Ranieri’s mind as Jamie Vardy’s goal drought endures and his Leicester City side contemplate a relegation skirmish.\n\n“We miss everything from last season, including luck,” lamented Ranieri after seeing his side deservedly beaten by a renascent Sunderland who are now only two points behind them. “In football there are good and bad moments and now we must stick together.”\n\nNot that Leicester’s manager has entirely abandoned hope for the season. Indeed, he suggested that his team could be safely mid-table and Vardy rampant again once the Champions League knockout stage comes round. “A lot of teams are involved in the relegation battle and we’re one of them,” said Ranieri. “But I still believe in Jamie and sooner or later he will start scoring.”\n\nCrystal Palace beat Southampton to ease pressure on manager Alan Pardew Read more\n\nFor the moment the striker who turned Leicester into champions last season is without a goal in 16 club games and struggled to second guess the impressive Lamine Koné and Papy Djilobodji as Sunderland hauled themselves off the bottom courtesy of a third win in four matches.\n\n“Our performance was really good,” said David Moyes. “We’ve a long way to go but it’s a start. We’re playing better and we’re winning.”\n\nHis side opened strongly, forcing Wes Morgan into superb blocks to deny first Victor Anichebe and then Jermain Defoe near-certain goals. Rarely touching the ball, Leicester were battered by wave upon wave of home attacks. Even when they finally managed a break of their own and Vardy briefly menaced, Koné intervened with a fine interception.\n\nThat manoeuvre featured an increasingly elusive slick combination between the England forward and Riyad Mahrez but, tellingly, Sunderland enjoyed infinitely greater success in getting behind their opponents’ defence.\n\nThe power balance shifted slightly as Vardy headed three chances wide and, almost imperceptibly, Ranieri’s team rallied. Yet if the midfield contest was suddenly rather more equal, it still took an excellently-timed tackle from Robert Huth to deny Duncan Watmore as the winger hurtled towards Ron-Robert Zieler’s goal.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sunderland’s Jan Kirchhoff celebrates after Robert Huth’s own goal. Photograph: Lee Smith/Reuters\n\nSignificantly the moment – one of several similarly slapdash cameos – when Daniel Amartey passed straight to an initially startled, then immensely grateful, Patrick van Aanholt, allowing Moyes’s left-back to charge forward, seemed emblematic of Leicester’s wider decline.\n\nSunderland’s burgeoning recovery was assisted by the second-half introduction of midfielders Jan Kirchhoff and Seb Larsson, both newly fit after lengthy layoffs.\n\nIt also helped that Koné, who regressed alarmingly after signing a lucrative new contract, shone in central defence, reminding everyone why Everton were so keen to spend £18m on him during the summer. Helpfully, Djilobodji, Koné’s oft criticised but reassuringly quick partner, also excelled contributing a pivotal, if arguably inadvertent, block to divert Islam Slimani.\n\nWith hindsight it seemed a watershed as, within minutes, Larsson had whipped in a corner and Kirchhoff unleashed a glancing header which ricocheted off Huth on its way past a wrong-footed Zieler. Very soon afterwards Leicester looked lucky not to concede a penalty following Danny Simpson’s felling of van Aanholt. If Moyes felt outraged, Ranieri appeared increasingly uneasy and, using all three substitutes, took the once unheard-of step of withdrawing Mahrez.\n\nIt proved to no avail as Defoe delighted in scoring his fourth goal in five games. Simpson and friends had no answer to Anichebe’s powerful left-wing advance and allowed the influential, indefatigable forward’s cross to create a chance for Watmore. Although Huth blocked that effort, it fell to Defoe whose unerring shot left Zieler helpless. “Having a striker of Jermain’s class gives us a chance,” said Sunderland’s manager.\n\nTime remained for two of Ranieri’s substitutes to combine to goal-scoring effect, Demarai Gray displaying a glorious change of pace before Shinji Okazaki extended a boot and whipped his cross into the bottom corner.\n\nWith the otherwise under-worked Jordan Pickford saving smartly from Morgan in stoppage time it proved too little but Sunderland joy was tempered by the knee injury Watmore sustained falling awkwardly after challenging Christian Fuchs, which resulted in him being carried off with his injured leg braced. “It doesn’t look great for Duncan,” said Moyes. “But if we can keep this up we’ll be OK.”"}, {"date": "03/12/2016", "arena": "White Hart Lane", "attendance": 31663, "home_team": {"name": "Tottenham Hotspur", "lineup": [{"name": "Hugo Lloris", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals":

attendance, while the White Hart Lane PA announcer referred to the Swansea City substitute Fernando Llorente as Fernando Morientes on more than one occasion. But for the biggest laugh of the afternoon, nobody needed to look any further than the referee, Jon Moss, whose decision to award Dele Alli a penalty on 39 minutes for what was a swan dive broke Swansea City.\n\nAlli seemed to tumble in slow motion under Kyle Naughton’s non-challenge and when Moss blew for the penalty it was the catalyst for Tottenham Hotspur to surge to a much-needed win. Harry Kane scored from the spot and he would get another one after the interval to take his tally to seven in six appearances for the club.\n\nChelsea surge past Manchester City as Agüero and Fernandinho see red Read more\n\nSon Heung-min scored a beauty on 45 minutes, while Christian Eriksen helped himself to two more in the second half, and it meant that Mauricio Pochettino could exhale after a trying sequence. His Tottenham team had entered the game having won only one in 10 in all competitions. “We needed this after our defeats against Monaco and Chelsea,” Pochettino said.\n\nSwansea’s performance was the other joke. Bob Bradley described the penalty as a “game-changer”, which he was entitled to do, and he felt that Moss “was not in a very good position”. The manager went on to say it was just “a wrong decision”. But his team had done nothing in a proactive sense before the award and the way that they folded after it bodes badly for the battles ahead.\n\nSwansea had no answer to Tottenham’s pressing and, once they were behind and the onus was on them to come out and play, they looked vulnerable. Yet again, the brittleness of their defence was a worry. Bradley did not pull his punches and he has work to do before next Saturday’s home fixture against Sunderland.\n\n“We were not good enough,” the American said. “We were not able to play the first pass after the press and we cannot concede the number of goals we are conceding. We are frustrated and angry. But there was confidence after the draw at Everton and the win over Crystal Palace and it’s not all lost today.”\n\nTottenham were on the front foot from the first whistle but, although Kane and Kyle Walker worked Lukasz Fabianski, the home side felt a little one-paced and the atmosphere was flat. However, the penalty changed everything and no matter how many times you watched the replay, it was impossible to conclude that Alli had been sent tumbling by Naughton.\n\nThe Swansea full-back saw Alli steal in on his blind side and he actually pulled out of making a challenge. The Tottenham midfielder was already going down when he initiated what little contact there might have been and, quite simply, Moss bought it. Swansea were left to nurse a sense of injustice, with Fabianski booked for his protests and the coaches Paul Williams and Alan Curtis moved to confront Moss as the teams left the field at half-time.\n\nBy then, Tottenham were two to the good, and what an excellent second goal it was from Son. After Eriksen had seen an effort blocked, the ball looped over towards Son who, on the half turn, leapt into an acrobatic side-on shot that flew high past Fabianski at his near post.\n\nIt was Tottenham who were forcing the issue, with Walker, in particular, seeing a lot of the ball in the buildup to moves, after he had recovered from the shock of being caught in the head with a ridiculously high boot from Neil Taylor in the early running. It drew blood, while Walker also needed a strapping to his hand, having raised it to fend off the blow. Remarkably, Moss did not book Taylor.\n\nBradley introduced Morientes – sorry, Llorente – at half time and he would also send on Borja Baston and Wayne Routledge in a further attempt to inject attacking spark. Nothing worked for him. Swansea were bankrupt in a creative sense and Hugo Lloris was a virtual spectator in the Tottenham goal.\n\nSwansea were cooked when Alli fed Son on the breakaway and, when he was held up by Taylor, Kane arrived to sweep low past Fabianski.\n\nTottenham were soon looking as though they could score with every forward thrust, so dishevelled were Swansea, and Eriksen twisted the knife. The Denmark midfielder bundled in his first goal after Alli’s shot had looped up off Fabianski and his second was a neat touch and low finish from the substitute Moussa Sissoko’s pass."}, {"date": "03/12/2016", "arena": "The Hawthorns", "attendance": 22244, "home_team": {"name": "West Bromwich Albion", "lineup": [{"name": "Ben Foster", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Craig Dawson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gareth McAuley", "yellows": [15], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonny Evans", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [16], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Allan Nyom", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Darren Fletcher", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Claudio Yacob", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Brunt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [34], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [80]}, {"name": "James Morrison", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [75]}, {"name": "Matt Phillips", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [90], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Salomón Rondón", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [88]}], "subs": [{"name": "Jonas Olsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Hal Robson-Kanu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [88], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Craig Gardner", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James McClean", "yellows": [84], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [80], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Brendan Galloway", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nacer Chadli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [75], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex Palmer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Watford", "lineup": [{"name": "Heurelho Gomes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Juan Camilo Zuniga", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [77]}, {"name": "Christian Kabasele", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [60], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sebastian Prödl", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "José Holebas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Roberto Pereyra", "yellows": [], "reds": [84], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adlene Guedioura", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Etienne Capoue", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nordin Amrabat", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stefano Okaka", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Troy Deeney", "yellows": [85], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Isaac Success", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Abdoulaye Doucouré", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jerome Sinclair", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Watson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Odion Ighalo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [77], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Costel Pantilimon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andrew Eleftheriou", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "At the end of a costly week, Tony Pulis can at least take solace from a three-point gain. This win will not offset his heavy loss in the high court, where, as the written ruling published on Monday explained, the Albion manager was ordered to pay his former club, Crystal Palace, £3.77m for the manner of his departure from Selhurst Park in 2014. But beating Watford extended a good run of results for Albion and left home fans smiling at the Hawthorns. That counts for a lot. Sixth place in the Premier League, for a start.\n\n“I haven’t taken my eye off the ball and it hasn’t affected the club,” said Pulis of his legal woe, after a game in which Albion fans delivered their own verdict on their manager. Earlier this season regulars at the Hawthorns were losing faith in Pulis’s ability to foster entertaining football but recent performances have infused new belief and he was serenaded after just 37 minutes here, by which time Albion were 2-0 up. As Pulis granted the crowd’s melodious request for a wave, his Watford counterpart, Walter Mazzarri, seethed at the fact that the visitors were trailing despite dominating. His anger would deepen before the end, as Albion quashed a second-half fightback and Roberto Pereyra was sent off . “The referee was terrible,” said Mazzarri, who claimed that the official, Graham Scott, “was the first cause of the result”.\n\nWatford were not blameless. Albion’s most potent weapon is no secret so the visitors should have been ready to defend set pieces. But, in the 16th minute, Chris Brunt delivered a corner from the left and Jonny Evans outjumped Christian Kabasele with ease and headed into the net. Mazzarri said that the ball would not have reached Evans if the goalkeeper, Heurelho Gomes, had not been blocked by an opponent.\n\nThe goal came from Albion’s first attack after a strong start by Watford, Nordin Amrabat forcing Ben Foster into a terrific save in the second minute. The visitors’ clever movement was making the hosts look stodgy and, after Albion scored against the run of play, an equaliser would have been a good bet. But chance went against Watford in the 34th minute, when James Morrison rolled a free-kick to Brunt 25 yards out and the Northern Irishman’s shot deflected off Camilo Zúñiga and into the net.\n\n“You should have gone Christmas shopping!” the jubilant home crowd advised the travelling fans. But Albion had not wrapped up victory yet.\n\nAmrabat hared down the right and presented Deeney with a chance in the 49th minute but the striker’s shot was blocked and Stefano Okaka could not poke the rebound into the net.\n\nWatford were looking stronger and halved the deficit on the hour, Kabasele atoning for his first-half mistake by stabbing the ball into the net from close range after Deeney re-routed a long corner by José Holebas.\n\nStoke City and Marc Muniesa prove too good for Burnley Read more\n\nWith Watford on the up there was no telling how the match would end. Matt Phillips tried to clarify the matter but his curling shot flew inches past the post. Then Watford went close again, but Foster saved at the feet of Pereyra.\n\nIt was an ardently fought contest – literally so in the 84th minute, when Pereyra and the recently introduced James McClean clashed near the sideline and triggered mass jostling and a couple of token kicks. Scott, after consultations with the fourth official, deemed Pereyra the worst offender; the sentence a red card. McClean was served a yellow.\n\n“It was absolutely unfair,” said Mazzarri. “It is normal a player gives a small push, especially after a rival was pushing him the whole time. If there was someone to be sent off it had to be the other person.” Pulis was not so sure. “I was right in front of it,” he said. “I think the kid [Pereyra] kicked out, I was more concerned about James than anything else and trying to get him away from the incident, not that I think he did anything.”\n\nPhillips inflicted further punishment in stoppage time, firing into the net from 20 yards

Yet a more accurate summary is that Arsenal were superior from start to finish, played with the cold-blooded intent of potential champions and exposed West Ham United’s defensive shortcomings so clinically that some awkward questions will be asked about Slaven Bilic’s future.\n\nWhile West Ham contemplated the likelihood of a long, dispiriting fight against relegation, Arsenal responded to Chelsea’s victory over Manchester City earlier in the day by rising into second place, three points behind Antonio Conte’s leaders. They drew inspiration from splendid performances from the two maestros in their attack and the quality of their football during that blistering 14-minute spell, when Alexis Sánchez scored a stunning hat-trick, ensured that Arsène Wenger arrived for his press conference with a smile on his face.\n\nWhether we are witnessing the emergence of the third great team of the Wenger era remains to be seen but there can be no doubt that Arsenal are developing the killer instinct that has so often undermined them since The Invincibles won the title in 2004. Wenger observed that the one regret from the first half was that Arsenal scored only once, Sánchez teeing up the excellent Mesut Özil for a simple finish, and that might have been the start of a lament about needless dropped points in previous seasons. Yet Arsenal’s growing professionalism meant that West Ham’s hopes of an equaliser always looked slim.\n\nAny team with serious aspirations of winning the title must beat opponents languishing near the bottom and it was not long before Arsenal were spreading anxiety in West Ham’s defence, seeking to capitalise on the injury to James Collins that forced Bilic to switch from three to four at the back after seven minutes. Álvaro Arbeloa came on for his first appearance since October and the veteran right-back’s rustiness was clearly visible as Nacho Monreal raced behind him on several occasions. Winston Reid alertly denied Sánchez but West Ham were creaking.\n\nWest Ham United 1-5 Arsenal: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nIt was certainly a strange experience to be at a London derby and find such a subdued atmosphere. Gone are the tight, inhospitable surroundings of Upton Park, where visiting teams could usually expect a fierce reception from home fans who acted as a 12th man for West Ham in the biggest matches. With its running track, the London Stadium has none of the old snarl. The empty seats dotted around the home areas were impossible to miss and so was the palpable sense of unease whenever Arsenal attacked, rejoicing in the wide open spaces on the break.\n\nWest Ham have deeper concerns on the pitch, however, and it exasperated Bilic to see one of his more experienced players gift Arsenal their opener. Angelo Ogbonna’s casual attempt to play out from the back allowed Francis Coquelin to divert the ball to Sánchez, who beat Reid’s feeble challenge before presenting Özil with an open goal.\n\nMichail Antonio, Aaron Cresswell, Cheikhou Kouyaté and Diafra Sakho were all unavailable for West Ham but Bilic was not interested in excuses. A point above the bottom three, West Ham cannot fool themselves into thinking that they are too good to go down. It will alarm the club’s hierarchy to hear Bilic say that “the dedication to the cause is missing”.\n\n“Somewhere during the line we lost the intensity in training,” West Ham’s manager said. “We can’t rely on quality. It’s my responsibility to get it back.”\n\nIt was difficult to disagree when the stadium announcer began a half-time interview with Marlon Harewood, who scored the winner in this fixture 10 years ago, by joking that “there aren’t many natural goalscorers at West Ham”.\n\nAshley Fletcher toiled on his own up front but there was a warning for Arsenal when the otherwise ineffective Dimitri Payet sent Manuel Lanzini through on goal when the game was still goalless. The Argentinian dithered, though, and shot too close to Petr Cech after a muddled dribble.\n\nThat chance aside, Cech would do little of any significance until he picked the ball out of the net when Andy Carroll, who made his first appearance since August as a late substitute, headed in the rebound after Payet’s free-kick had struck the woodwork.\n\nArsenal already led 3-0 by that point, though. Wenger had been fretting about his team’s slender lead until Sánchez barrelled past Arthur Masuaku and drove a shot past Darren Randolph, who had no chance when the Chilean beat him with another crisp effort from 20 yards. “He has a killer instinct,” Wenger said.\n\nCarroll’s consolation only provoked Arsenal. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain responded with a fine goal and Sánchez rubbed further salt into the wound when he produced a beautiful dink over Randolph.

Too many of Walter Mazzarri’s players looked less than enamoured with the idea of a midday kick-off on a cold day in Hertfordshire and there was little justification in Watford hiding behind Bobby Madley’s refereeing performance as a cover for their inert showing.\n\nThey did have a legitimate grievance with Stoke’s goal given that Adam confessed to a push on Valon Behrami before his header hit a post and rebounded in off the unfortunate Heurelho Gomes. Mazzarri felt that Madley made too many questionable calls yet the Watford manager’s argument that his team played well enough to merit a point was unconvincing. There were precious few panicky moments for Stoke’s defence.\n\nThe hosts were indisciplined. Nordin Amrabat picked up a booking for dissent in the first half, Miguel Britos received a late red card and what should trouble Watford is the disgruntled reaction from their supporters at the final whistle. It would have been harder for Stoke not to win for the first time since 31 October.

Stoke’s manager preferred to focus on his team’s resolute performance. They were alert from the first whistle, pinning the hosts back and forcing them to make sloppy errors in dangerous areas. Gomes saved an early effort from Bruno Martins Indi and Giannelli Imbula threatened, bending a shot inches wide. Imbula’s unchallenged dribble was a sign for Mazzarri that his midfield was being overrun.\n\nStoke had the measure of Watford’s 3-4-3 system and dominated possession in the first half, with Hughes responding to Glenn Whelan failing a late fitness test by moving Xherdan Shaqiri inside from the right. “They surprised us a lot in the midfield,” Mazzarri said.\n\nTroy Deeney and Roberto Pereyra were peripheral in attack for Watford and the excellent Martins Indi rose to the occasion in the absence of the injured Ryan Shawcross, Stoke’s defensive leader and captain, while Marc Muniesa delivered a quietly impressive performance.\n\nWatford’s lethargy was encapsulated by the moment when Christian Kabasele apparently forgot that there was a chance he might have to participate in a football match at some point. Younès Kaboul went down with an injury, signalled that he could not continue and Watford tried to make a quick change. Sitting on the bench, though, Kabasele was not ready and Watford were forced to continue with 10 men for a couple of minutes.\n\nMazzarri looked bemused, a PE teacher trying and failing to understand how his pupil could have left his kit at home. A minute more and Kabasele would have been doing laps of the pitch in his underpants, but he eventually emerged to ironic cheers. Then, hoping to redeem himself, the Belgian defender chopped down Marko Arnautovic.\n\nEight minutes after Kabasele’s inauspicious arrival, Stoke scored when Shaqiri delivered a corner from the right and Adam gave Behrami the slip.\n\nMazzarri brought on Odion Ighalo after the break and moved him next to Deeney, who sent a late header over.

Arsenal had last won a November league fixture in 2014 and they came into this game on the back of three rather underwhelming draws in succession.\n\nBournemouth gifted Arsenal the opening goal when Cook attempted a back pass but found only Sánchez who, in yards of space, cut inside and shot low past the exposed Adam Federici.

Cook and Francis were booked after being beaten for pace by Sánchez and Alex Oxlade‑Chamberlain, respectively, while the excellent Nathan Aké made important blocks to deny Mesut Özil and Mohamed Elneny. Arsenal also shouted for a penalty when Aké caught Sánchez but the contact appeared to take place outside the area. Jones, who had a difficult afternoon, saw no foul.\n\nArsenal 3-1 Bournemouth: Premier League – as it happened! Read more\n\nHe did act – to the dismay of Wenger and the home crowd – when Wilson surged into the area in the 22nd minute. Across came Monreal, who flung out his arm and he caught the Bournemouth striker. The previous weekend, Wilson had been denied a clear penalty when Stoke City’s Ryan Shawcross cleaned him out but he was on the right side of this more debatable award. Wenger called it a “very soft one”. Mustafi was booked for his protests and Wilson, having dusted himself down, kept his cool to beat Petr Cech.\n\nIn a flash, the game turned. “We became nervous and the three [recent] draws played on our minds,” Wenger said. Adam Smith headed over on 26 minutes when gloriously placed, following Aké’s header back, and Brad Smith, playing his first league game for Bournemouth, worked Cech at his near post. Howe’s team played some neat football and the pace of Wilson, Josh King and Junior Stanislas worried Arsenal.\n\n“The result was harsh on us – considering we gave them the first goal,” Howe said. “It was a penalty for handball [against Monreal]. The scoreline is difficult to swallow.”\n\nArsenal regained a foothold before the interval and it was Sánchez, inevitably, who was to the fore. He swiped over after an interchange with Özil and, on the stroke of half-time, he rattled the crossbar from an angle on the right.\n\nMonreal was central to the goal that put Arsenal back in front and it was an excellent piece of technique with which he returned Özil’s cross from the right, which had flicked off Aké. The first-time ball was made to measure for Walcott, whose downwards header beat Federici. It was only the second time that Walcott had scored with his head in the Premier League.\n\nHowe and his players were upset at Jones’s decision not to penalise Monreal for the apparent handball, while Cech saved at close quarters from the substitute and former Arsenal striker, Benik Afobe.

stands.\n\nUnited will rue their lack of ruthlessness and Mourinho may regret the 27th‑minute incident in which he kicked a water bottle in anger at the booking by Jonathan Moss of Paul Pogba for diving, which was actually proved to be the correct decision by the referee.\n\nMourinho received a one-match ban for verbal misconduct towards Mark Clattenburg during the draw here with Burnley in October.\n\nThe United manager may well be handed a similar punishment – at a minimum – for his behaviour on Sunday, with Moss also the referee who dismissed him against West Ham United at the Boleyn Ground when he was with Chelsea last season.\n\nSpeaking in Mourinho’s absence his assistant, Rui Faria, said the manager’s ire derived from Pogba apparently deserving a foul earlier in the same incident, though what evidence there was seemed inconclusive.\n\nNone of this should distract from another disappointing result for United that leaves them with 20 points, their poorest return after 13 matches since the Premier League began.\n\n“We were the best team on the pitch,” Faria said. “We didn’t have any tactical issues during the game. The game was what we expected. Defensively we were very compact. Offensively we created the chances to win. We are showing that as a team we are a strong side and we can do very good things.”\n\nOf Diafra Sakho’s opening goal for West Ham, he said: “We will have time to analyse the goal. When you concede a goal there is always a reason for that and something that went wrong at a defensive set play. If it is something wrong it is something we will try to correct. We need to watch.”\n\nTowards the end, Henrikh Mkhitaryan hit the right post and Jesse Lingard finished but this was adjudged offside. Pogba went close with a shot Darren Randolph – who had a fine outing – saved impressively.\n\nHowever, despite the grandstand finish United might have lost. At the death the replacement Ashley Fletcher forced David de Gea into a frantic close-range stop.\n\nThis means Manchester United are now 11 points behind Chelsea and any title‑challenging hopes distant. Faria dead‑batted a question on whether the prospect is now gone.\n\n“In this moment we are more looking to the team and trying to get the best results,” he said. “We knew the job was not easy and we try to change things. We believe things will change and what we are chasing will arrive for sure.\n\n“If it was easy, the ones who were here before would do it. We had a lot of work in front and it is what we are doing. It is big work and we are also used to big clubs and we know how to take a big club to win. We know we will get it.”\n\nFor the third time this season United were caught out at the kick-off. The previous two occasions led to goals by Chelsea (after 40 seconds) and Fenerbahce (two minutes) – and 90 seconds were gone on Sunday when United went behind.\n\nThis was simple stuff. Dimitri Payet lifted a free-kick in from the right and Sakho eased ahead of Zlatan Ibrahimovic to head home. Ander Herrera may or may not have been impeded by Michail Antonio as the ball flew past but Ibrahimovic should still have done better. Or, perhaps, an actual defender – Phil Jones or Marcos Rojo – might have been detailed to mark Sakho.\n\nThe bottom line was that the Portuguese was reduced to waving his men back to restart quickly and United were behind far too soon.\n\nSlowly, United took over and, 19 minutes later, equalised via the intelligence of Pogba and Ibrahimovic. When the Frenchman looked up he saw the No9 darting into space and landed a chip on his head from which Ibrahimovic beat Randolph for his ninth goal of the season.\n\nThen came Mourinho’s latest altercation with an official.\n\nManchester United v West Ham United: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nWhen Pogba went down following a Mark Noble challenge it appeared the Frenchman had been fouled. Mourinho was incandescent that he was booked but replays showed Moss was correct. Moments before, Payet had bought a free-kick when Ander Herrera seemed to make zero contact and this also made Mourinho cross. This may have added to his fury at Pogba’s yellow card yet, really, he should have calmed himself. Instead, a water bottle went flying and off he went, though where to exactly was a mystery.\n\nArsenal’s 3-1 win against Bournemouth earlier had increased the need for United to win if they wished to keep the top four in sight. So as he ordered his side out for the second half Mourinho surely urged them to hunt for the three points.\n\nThe XI chosen showed six changes from Thursday night. Out went Wayne Rooney, Mkhitaryan, Luke Shaw, Sergio Romero, Michael Carrick and Daley Blind. In came De Gea, Rojo, Matteo Darmian, Marcus Rashford, Lingard and Herrera.\n\nThere was a place, too, for Bastian Schweinsteiger on the bench – yet by the close West Ham had an invaluable point and United were staring at a fourth consecutive home league draw.\n\nThe West Ham manager, Slaven Bilic, said: “I am very pleased with the performance.”"}, {"date": "27/11/2016", "arena": " Mary's

expected but that did not make it any easier to bear. After hearing some less than -kind words from the home ranks the Dutchman had to watch on as his new side were deservedly beaten by his old one. The Everton manager could not hide his anger afterwards and may well now be wondering if he made the right decision swapping the south coast for Merseyside after all.\n\nThe goal that decided this contest came early – after 41 seconds, in fact – and the truth is Everton never really recovered. As against Swansea City last week their approach play was sluggish and limited for large periods but the difference this time was that they could not muster an equaliser. The visitors had only one shot on target and it came as little surprise to see many of their supporters heading for the exits long before the final whistle had blown.\n\nSouthampton 1-0 Everton: Premier League – as it happened! Read more\n\nIn contrast Southampton’s fans were buoyant until the end, albeit after they had got some ill-feeling off their chests. “We fucking hate you, Ronald Koeman” was among the chants delivered by the majority of those located in the Northam Stand on seeing the man in question’s emergence from the tunnel before kick-off; his decision to leave Southampton in the summer is clearly not forgotten or forgiven in these parts.\n\nSome would deem that ungrateful given the 53-year-old led the club to sixth- and seventh-place finishes, their best in the Premier League, in his two seasons at the club but from the recipient came no disgust.\n\n“Everyone is free to give the reaction they want,” Koeman said. “I know how the players of Southampton react to me and I know the staff of Southampton appreciate what we did together. The rest is football. That’s life.”\n\nThe abuse looked set to continue only for Charlie Austin to change the mood completely and before the majority in attendance were comfortable in their seats. Southampton started with a bang and, after Everton had failed to clear Cédric’s right-wing cross, the striker secured his ninth goal of the season with a close‑range header. Cue jubilation in the Northam Stand and elsewhere.\n\nA key figure in the goal was the 19‑year‑old winger Josh Sims, who was handed a surprise debut by Claude Puel having impressed for Southampton’s under-23 side, and the teenager repaid his manager’s faith with a display that brimmed with menace.\n\nIt was Sims’s long‑range shot that caused Everton’s defence initially to panic in the buildup to the goal and from the same player came the assist, a clever and quick scooped pass to Austin after Cédric’s delivery had bounced off Séamus Coleman.\n\nFrom there Sims continued to torment those in blue from an advanced right-sided position and he almost produced the moment of the match midway through the second half after driving past Leighton Baines and Ashley Williams only to mess up at the crucial stage by playing a poor square pass that was easily cut out by Idrissa Gueye.\n\nAlexis Sánchez double helps Arsenal fend off tenacious Bournemouth Read more\n\nNevertheless it was a hugely encouraging debut from the latest member of Southampton’s much-vaunted academy and Sims was rightly awarded a standing ovation from the home spectators after being replaced by another youth product, Sam McQueen, on 84 minutes.\n\n“For a first game in the Premier League it was very good,” Puel said. “It was not a risk to start him as I have seen very good things from him in training sessions and with the under-23s.”\n\nOthers in red and white also impressed, no one more so than Virgil van Dijk, who continues to look one of the most complete defenders in the country. Puel suggested the only disappointment for Southampton was that they did not get the second goal that their display of great togetherness and intent deserved.\n\nJames Ward-Prowse failed with a couple of presentable chances late on while a powerful header from Austin on 58 minutes was kept out only by Maarten Stekelenburg’s impressive low save.\n\nThe hosts’ first league win since mid‑October moves them up to 10th, three places and two points off Everton, who showed more urgency in the second half but generally posed little threat, with Gareth Barry’s late volley the one time Fraser Forster was called into action.\n\nIt is now one win in eight games for a side who began the season with grand ambitions. “I’m not worried about results, I’m worried about what I see on the pitch,” said Koeman, who later claimed he “wasn’t aware” of Sims during his time at Southampton.\n\n“We are starting games badly and have difficulties being organised defensively.

Sean Dyche was closer to the truth with “two blips in a really good gameplan”, but though Burnley might have had a first-half penalty when Nicolás Otamendi barged into Jeff Hendrick, the home side had to accept they did not do quite enough to knock City out of their stride.\n\nBurnley 1-2 Manchester City: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nThe visitors must have been encouraged by the knowledge that a calf injury had ruled out Tom Heaton, something of a lucky talisman for Burnley this season, at least the way José Mourinho tells it. The home fans were not exactly thrilled at the news that 37-year-old Paul Robinson would be making his Burnley debut after two years without a league game – though, in the event, the former England goalkeeper took up where Heaton had left off, making a couple of first-half saves from Agüero that prevented his side conceding first.\n\nBetter than that, it was Robinson who provided an assist when City conceded first. Burnley sent everyone forward for a free-kick that the keeper clipped into the goalmouth and Dean Marney pounced gratefully on a half clearance to score with a right-foot volley from the edge of the area.\n\nIf City needed a wake-up call – and a generally flat first-half display suggested that they did – Marney did well to provide it before being forced off with an injury. Burnley’s only worry, apart from the fact that Johann Gudmundsson also pulled a hamstring and followed Marney down the tunnel before half-time, was that City still had more than an hour to get their act together and respond.\n\nIt took them a while; this was far from their slick and smooth-passing best, but shortly after Yaya Touré had struck the frame of the goal and booted the ball away in frustration, Raheem Sterling and Nolito forced Michael Keane to concede a corner and with the ball bobbling untidily around the six-yard box Agüero poked home a close-range equaliser.\n\nGoal of the season contender it was not, but Agüero was back in more recognisable form before the interval in bringing a fingertip save from Robinson with a curling shot.\n\nCity might have taken the lead in the four minutes of first-half stoppage time occasioned by the two Burnley injuries, but though Sterling and Agüero could virtually have passed the ball into the net, they were far too casual in finding each other and the opportunity was missed.\n\nThe visitors kept up the pressure in the second half, forcing Burnley ever deeper in defence, and the only surprise when Agüero gave the visitors the lead on the hour was that, again, Robinson was beaten from just a couple of yards out. A move appeared to have broken down when Touré was upended in the box after a surging run, but rather than pressing claims for a penalty, Fernandinho chased down the ball to cross from the narrowest of angles and Agüero made sure he was in place to supply the required touch.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Agüero watches as his touch sends the ball over the line to score. Photograph: Matt West/BPI/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nThe Argentina striker found himself on the wrong side of the referee soon afterwards for chipping the ball into the net after being ruled offside. One could understand Agüero’s annoyance: he seemed to be at least level with Stephen Ward, though the consequences are clear for anyone expressing displeasure in such a manner.\n\nThe match became a little fractious in the final quarter, with Nolito cautioned for bumping into Scott Arfield and then being withdrawn before he did anything more serious. While it is true that Nolito appeared in danger of losing his temper, the alleged foul on Arfield was nothing compared to the high challenge George Boyd got away with on Bacary Sagna moments later.\n\nBurnley had their moments as they tried to salvage a point, most notably in stoppage time, when Claudio Bravo saved from Ashley Barnes and Keane almost got his head to a cross that the goalkeeper fumbled, but City toughed out their win in a manner that pleased Guardiola.\n\nFielding questions in Spanish about the feistiness of the smaller clubs in the Premier League the City manager was highly complimentary about Burnley. “They do what they do very well,” he said. “It is very rewarding to win here as well as at Stoke City.”"}, {"date": "26/11/2016", "arena": "KCOM Stadium",

their late chances after their draw at Hull. Pulis pushed through the post-match press conference in double-quick time as West Brom made a futile bid to beat the encroaching weather and reach Humberside airport in time to make their short flight back to the Midlands.\n\nIt was far from the first missed opportunity of the day for the visitors after Salomón Rondón and Nacer Chadli missed excellent late chances to seal a third straight win.\n\nGareth McAuley had headed the visitors into a 34th minute lead before the Hull captain, Michael Dawson, struck the equaliser for the hosts early in the second half.\n\nPulis said: “In the last 15 minutes there was Chadli’s effort and two headers at the back post – we’re a bit disappointed. We should have won the game. “I thought [Rondón’s chance] was in from where I was. Salomón did a fantastic job and we just needed him to put that one in to put the icing on the cake.”\n\nThe visitors dominated possession in the first half but failed to make the most of their chances. Pulis paid tribute to the improvement of the hosts, who had failed to muster a single shot in the first 50 minutes.\n\n“In the second half you have to give Hull credit - they started well and put us on the back foot and had a couple of opportunities.\n\n“I thought we’d weathered that but obviously they get the goal, but the great thing is this group of lads know how to keep working.”\n\nThe Hull manager, Mike Phelan, paid tribute to Dawson, who bounced back from a nightmare display at the Stadium of Light two weeks ago to grab his side a crucial point.\n\nHe said: “Michael is a very experienced footballer and he loves being captain of this club. He makes mistakes just like the rest of us – if you look at the first goal at Sunderland he probably made a rash call – but this week he’s done totally the opposite. Experience tells you that he’s learned from that so he’s not going to go there again, and now he’s contributed with the goal which is even better.”\n\nPhelan went on to hail his side’s second half display but said they were still lucky to emerge with a point after West Brom’s missed chances late on. “We had the better of the second half but we could have conceded at the death and I could be sitting here talking about a defeat. But we got away with it – we’re still in virgin territory a bit and we have to learn to concentrate for 96 minutes of the match because it is never over.”\n\nIslam Slimani penalty rescues draw for

Four days after marching into the last 16 of the Champions League they produced a display that prompted their manager, Claudio Ranieri, to declare that they are in a domestic relegation fight.\n\nA stoppage-time penalty by Islam Slimani averted a third successive defeat in the Premier League but could not mask the fact that the champions are floundering on the home front while flourishing in continental competition.\n\nThis draw leaves them two points above the bottom three. “The performance wasn’t good, Middlesbrough played better than us,” said Ranieri. “I am not worried but I’m a very pragmatic man. For us now it is important to think we are in a relegation battle and then every point is OK. Of course we always want to win but when it’s not possible, one point is OK.”\n\nFor a long time even one point looked beyond them here. Middlesbrough started as if the King Power was their own estate, swaggering with the confidence of a team that had lost one league game on the road this season and could sense the vulnerability of their hosts. They passed better and pressed harder than the hosts, whose impotence in the face of such uppityness was staggering.\n\nIt took Boro 13 minutes to help themselves to the lead. Alvaro Negredo swept a pass wide to Gastón Ramírez on the left, and the Uruguayan cantered forward before delivering a return pass to the striker, who had made his way into the box. Negredo’s connection with the ball was unclean but nowhere near as slovenly as Leicester’s tracking. The ball flew past Ron-Robert Zieler for Negredo’s first goal since the opening day of the season.\n\nThere was no immediate reaction from Leicester. They continued to look hungover as Boro made merry around them, passing with an accuracy that Leicester could not match on the rare occasions they got the ball. The home team’s only threat came from long throw-ins by Christian Fuchs. Then, on the half-hour, a flash of magic by Riyad Mahrez woke Leicester up.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Alvaro Negredo slots Boro 2-1 ahead. Photograph: Plumb Images/Leicester City FC via Getty Imag\n\nThe Algerian shimmied his way down the right and then clipped a cross to Shinji Okazaki, who very nearly applied a delectable finish, but his overhead kick whizzed out off the top of the crossbar.\n\nThen luck smiled on Leicester, which is to say that Lee Mason pointed to the spot for a penalty that should not have been given. Callum Chambers handled the ball when it was lofted into the box by Danny Simpson but that was because he had been shoved in the back by Wes Morgan. “Morgan recognised that to my players at half-time,” said Aitor Karanka. But by then Mahrez had converted the spot kick.\n\nSwansea City stun Crystal Palace as Fernando Llorente settles thriller Read more\n\nLeicester briefly improved and would have scored in the 41st minute following cute play by Okazaki and Mahrez if Ramírez had not made a superb intervention to nick the ball off the toe of Jamie Vardy six yards from goal. Vardy must not have seen Ramírez coming, which was apt given that he himself had been nigh-on invisible up to that point.\n\nHe was not seen again until the 64th minute, when he was booked for a late tackle on Clayton. Straight after that he was substituted, with Islam Slimani entering in his place. Soon after Mahrez made way too, Ahmed Musa introduced instead. Leicester had a lot of the ball but created little.\n\nThen Boro showed how to make the most of possession. Adam Forshaw dropped a splendid pass over the Leicester defence from inside his own half and with Fuchs and Robert Huth caught out Negredo swept the bouncing ball past Zieler from a tight angle.\n\nOnly in the dying minutes did Leicester summon defiance.

Their old classmate, it transpired, is still learning at the age of 49. “I learned today that we are able to beat even the most defensive team I ever played against,” he said following Liverpool’s brief return to the Premier League summit (ended by Chelsea). “That is a nice thing to learn.”\n\nA rewarding victory came at a price for Liverpool. Philippe Coutinho was taken off on a stretcher with an ankle injury that will require a scan and left the influential Brazil international hobbling out of Anfield on crutches. His replacement, Divock Origi, would eventually break Sunderland’s resistance just as the fear of a second consecutive goalless draw appeared to have gripped the home crowd, prompting another of those furious outbursts from their manager.\n\n“The crowd was really good in the first half and in second half it was like, ‘Come on, we’ve waited long enough’,” he said. “Atmosphere is a big, big part of the game and I tried to remind the crowd. They reacted brilliantly.”\n\nOrigi’s influence on Liverpool’s sixth win in seven home matches provided another demonstration of the quality attacking options at Klopp’s disposal. The performance and atmosphere showed how far Liverpool have come in the nine months since Sunderland were last here and recovered from a two-goal deficit thanks to a player who now languishes in jail, Adam Johnson. Back in February Liverpool were wracked by division, thousands walking out in protest at proposed ticket price rises, and brittle when faced with recovery by a relegation-threatened team. Today, they are united, confident and finding solutions.\n\nKlopp said: “I didn’t think about Southampton [last week’s opponents] for one second. This was much more defensive. I don’t think I have ever played against a more defensive team, man-marking against Coutinho, Victor Anichebe at left full-back and how many touches did Defoe have? We forced them to be so defensive.\n\n“It was a real challenge in our development and we showed we are ready to play against teams like this.”\n\nSwansea City stun Crystal Palace as Fernando Llorente settles thriller Read more\n\nSunderland’s anxieties had eased a little with back-to-back league wins, their first under David Moyes, and they succeeded where many have failed this season in stifling Liverpool throughout the first half. They were less assured than usual, their touch heavier and their penetrating runs in behind not quite paying off, but the visitors’ approach was instrumental with Jason Denayer designated to track Coutinho’s every step.\n\nLiverpool’s threat levels increased once the Brazilian exited, strangely, with Sunderland ending the first half hanging on in an 8-2-0 formation. He had been injured when Didier Ndong cleared the ball off his toes but connected with the right foot on the follow-through.\n\nOrigi brought a more direct, physical presence to an attack that had rarely threatened the commanding Jordan Pickford in Sunderland’s goal for the opening half-hour. Dejan Lovren headed wide when Jordan Henderson’s free-kick found the central defender unmarked at the back post. Emre Can also put a free header wide and Lovren went close from almost 30 yards as Liverpool stepped up the pressure as half-time approached.\n\nIt never dropped after the restart and Sunderland were clinging on, reliant on good fortune and the right breaks.\n\nGeorginio Wijnaldum volleyed wide from close range, Can’s half volley sailed beyond Pickford’s left post, the two midfielders both failed to connect with Firmino’s low cross across the face of goal and Henderson sent a well-placed free-kick just over. When Denayer threw himself at Sadio Mané’s close-range shot the tension around Anfield intensified but Origi released it out of nothing with 15 minutes remaining. The Belgium international took possession on the left of the area, cut back inside a tired challenge from Duncan Watmore and curled a shot low into the far corner of Pickford’s goal.\n\nWatmore had squandered an excellent chance at 0-0 and in stoppage time Mané broke from the halfway line, held off Denayer and was sent flying by Ndong. James Milner converted a clear penalty with ease.\n\n“I don’t know any good teams who aren’t first and foremost defensively sound,” said Moyes in response to Klopp’s barbed comments. “If you want to win the Premier League, you are going to have to have a good defence. If you want to avoid relegation, you have to have a good defence. We have not been good enough defensively recently but the lads did a job today, but it was always going to be difficult coming here.”"}, {"date": "26/11/2016", "arena": "The Liberty Stadium", "attendance": 20276, "home_team": {"name": "Swansea City", "lineup": [{"name": "Lukasz Fabianski", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Naughton", "yellows": [72], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [86]}, {"name": "Federico Fernandez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordi Amat", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Neil Taylor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Cork", "yellows": [27], "reds": [], "own_goals": [82], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jay Fulton", "yellows": [86], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leroy Fer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [66, 68], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Modou Barrow", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [80]}, {"name": "Gylfi Sigurdsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [36], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wayne Routledge", "yellows": [22], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [66]}], "subs": [{"name": "Mike van der Hoorn", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fernando Llorente", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [90, 90], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [66], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathan Dyer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kristoffer Nordfeldt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jefferson Montero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [86], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Angel Rangel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [80], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Oliver McBurnie", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Crystal Palace", "lineup": [{"name": "Wayne Hennessey", "yellows": [42], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joel Ward", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Scott Dann", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Tomkins", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [75], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Kelly", "yellows": [68], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [73]}, {"name": "Wilfried Zaha", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [19], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yohan Cabaye", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James McArthur", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [82]}, {"name": "Jason Puncheon", "yellows": [67], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Benteke", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [84], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Connor Wickham", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [52]}], "subs": [{"name": "Julian Speroni", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fraizer Campbell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andros Townsend", "yellows": [54], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [52], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Ledley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Zeki Fryers", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [73], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bakary Sako", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [82], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Damien Delaney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "With six minutes remaining, Alan Pardew was celebrating on the touchline. At the final whistle, the Crystal Palace manager looked shellshocked and wore the haunted look of a man who knows that he is hanging on to his job by his fingertips after an extraordinary match delivered an improbable Swansea City victory.\n\nPalace had seemingly come back from the dead when they scored three times in nine minutes to take the lead after trailing 3-1, with Christian Benteke’s late goal prompting some Swansea fans to head for the exits, resigned to defeat as well as relegation.\n\nLiverpool edge past Sunderland but lose Philippe Coutinho to injury Read more\n\nThe cheers from afar moments later would have told them that something remarkable was happening as Fernando Llorente, who has struggled so much since his arrival from Sevilla in the summer, scored twice in injury time to breathe new life into Swansea’s season and inflict a sixth successive defeat on a Palace side that are now only outside the relegation zone on goal difference.\n\nPardew looked a broken man, flabbergasted and furious with the way that his fragile defence imploded yet again. They have now gone 18 Premier League games without keeping a clean sheet and Pardew clearly underestimated their inadequacies beforehand when, alluding to their problems in that department, the manager talked about how he “couldn’t see us winning at Swansea unless we get two goals”. Little did he realise that they would need six.\n\nThe question now is how patient the Palace board will be with a manager who is in charge of a club that has the worst record across all four divisions in the calendar year. Not only that, but he seems unable to arrest the decline. “That’s not my decision,” Pardew said when asked whether he thought the board would back him. “My decision is always the same; when you’re a football manager you’ve just got to try and address the problems and deal with it. I’m certainly strong enough and I’ve been here before. I know how it works.”\n\nHow it works is that Pardew is now the odds-on favourite to be the next manager sacked and is under intense pressure from outside, never mind inside, the club. “That comes with the territory,” he said. “The goals that we conceded today don’t reflect well on us. I’ll do what I always do – reflect on this game and try and correct it for the next one. But six defeats, and a couple of defeats we shouldn’t have had – Burnley and this one – that’s what’s put us in this mess that we’re in.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A dejected looking Alan Pardew. Photograph: Christopher Lee/Getty Images\n\n“The last 20 minutes was as crazy as I have ever seen. If we can’t defend at 4-3 with about six minutes on the clock, I’m afraid that’s not good enough. We just can’t seem to defend set-plays; that’s four today. All four of them I think we should do a whole lot better than we do. I’m going to have a look at that and possibly make changes.”\n\nWith Pardew’s position under so much scrutiny and Palace in freefall, it was easy to overlook just what this result means to Swansea. It was their first victory since the opening day of the season and while their defending was every bit as calamitous as Palace’s at times the result was everything for Bob Bradley and his players, who showed tremendous courage to claw their way back into a game that looked to be beyond them.\n\nIsaac Success: ‘Football can take you anywhere in your life’ Read more\n\nGylfi Sigurdsson was outstanding, Leroy Fer scored twice and Llorente showed the sort of predatory touch in front of goal that has been so badly lacking up. At the other end of the pitch, however, Swansea were an accident waiting to happen, with Wilfried Zaha’s opening goal exposing familiar failings as the winger wriggled clear of Neil Taylor before drilling home.\n\nSigurdsson then equalised with an exquisite free-kick and Palace started to lose their way, not helped by a potentially serious injury to Connor Wickham, who left the field on a stretcher. Fer struck twice in two minutes, stabbing home after Llorente’s header was cleared off the line and turning in again from close range after a Sigurdsson free-kick. Then came the Palace comeback.\n\nJames Tomkins reduced the deficit from inside the six-yard box, Jack Cork headed Zaha’s cross into his own net in farcical circumstances and Benteke hooked home off the post after Scott Dann had won yet another header in the Swansea penalty area. Swansea looked finished, yet they were anything but as Llorente scored twice from close range, to delight of their manager.\n\n“It’s a turning point in many ways,” said Bradley, who now has his first win in six matches. “At the most difficult moment the players showed character and that’s going to pay off for them.

After fielding the same Premier League selection for the sixth successive – and successful – time, Chelsea continued their revival as they saw off Tottenham, showing the mettle to muster a comeback after going a goal behind in the first half. Two of the players who have thrived most from the Conte redesign, Pedro and Victor Moses, supplied the goals to settle a riveting local tussle. After Manchester City and Liverpool had plundered points earlier in the day, nothing less than three would suffice to return to the top of the table. Chelsea reacted ruthlessly.\n\nIt left Conte with the air of a contented manager. He acknowledged the evolution that makes his team a different proposition in the high-intensity games to the side who capitulated against Liverpool and Arsenal. “Now we are another team compared to the Liverpool and Arsenal games,” he said. “If we were the same team we would lose this game, for sure. Now we have another type of confidence. I liked our reaction a lot. We won and I am pleased because it wasn’t easy.”\n\nFor Tottenham, defeat here to a long-term bogey side is nothing new but what must hurt is that for a spell their performance showed them at their best, with a refreshed appetite for the style that had them unbeaten in the Premier League until the winter chill had set in. History suggested that Stamford Bridge might be a test too far and what felt like a week of reckoning duly delivered two heavyweight blows. After tumbling out of the Champions League in midweek, Mauricio Pochettino’s men were punctured in the league.\n\nThe Tottenham manager managed to be frustrated and philosophical at the same time: “If you want to analyse the result, Chelsea win, congratulations. If you want to analyse the 94 minutes, Tottenham had a lot of positives. But in football you need to score. In football sometimes it’s difficult to explain but this is not difficult. They were clinical in front of the goal and we weren’t.”\n\nAfter the smouldering volcano of this fixture last season, he had called upon his team to be “brave” and his players began as if that instruction was still ringing in their ears.\n\nKeeping a semblance of self-control was imperative and they started by exerting important authority in midfield, pegging Chelsea back and keeping confident possession. Ten minutes in they soared in front. Mousa Dembélé worked the ball up the left and it was moved via Dele Alli to Christian Eriksen. The Dane saw a chink of goal to aim at. His thunderous shot was laced with curl and flew into the net. It was the first time Chelsea’s defence had been beaten in 600 minutes.\n\nConte looked exasperated as his team could not get a foothold. The muscle in Tottenham’s midriff, with Dembélé and Victor Wanyama patrolling in front of Eric Dier and Jan Vertonghen, proved a meaty barrier. David Luiz mustered Chelsea’s first shot just before the half-hour mark, a whack of a free-kick that Hugo Lloris caught comfortably.\n\nTottenham’s dominance was such that they continued to create strong chances. After efforts from Kyle Walker, Harry Kane and Eriksen the visitors wondered how they were not even further in front as half-time approached.\n\nPhilippe Coutinho leaves Anfield on crutches but Jürgen Klopp hopeful Read more\n\nWhat more devastating time for Chelsea to summon some inspiration. A minute before half-time all Tottenham’s hard work was speared by a moment of glorious individual skill. Pedro picked up possession 20 yards out and wrong-footed the Tottenham defence with a touch that had a dash of Cruyff turn about it. The Spaniard bent his shot into the top corner with a flourish.\n\nOff the hook after a pretty uncomfortable first 44 minutes, Conte delivered some choice words at half-time. Chelsea came out with enhanced determination and were soon ahead. They pressed the ball off Tottenham and broke with intent. Eden Hazard invited Diego Costa to drive forwards and he capped a bullish and clever run with a killer pass to Moses, whose shot squirted off Lloris and Vertonghen on the way in. The pendulum had swung. Chelsea’s energy levels suddenly made Tottenham look ponderous. It spoke volumes about how the balance of the game shifted that both Chelsea’s wing-backs had so much more room to get involved.\n\nAlthough Tottenham tried to manufacture a comeback of their own, Chelsea’s second-half solidity was a far tougher nut to crack. Conte’s Undroppables cherished their win. Tottenham’s pain was palpable.\n\nConte tried hard to deflect any title talk at this stage. “It is not right to talk about this,” he said. “We have a long way in front of us. It’s important to stay humble and continue to trust in our work. Today we won a game against a really strong team. Tomorrow it’s important to think about the next game, against City, another very strong team. We have to continue to work. We don’t forget that against Arsenal and Liverpool we lost.”\n\nIn attitude and application, Conte’s Chelsea are a force to be reckoned with."}, {"date": "21/11/2016", "arena": "The Hawthorns",

supporters were singing Tony Pulis’ name as the Midlands club recorded an emphatic victory that reinforced the idea that Burnley do not take too kindly to being on the road.\n\nOn the basis of what we have seen so far this season, Burnley will be relying on their form at Turf Moor to extend their stay in the Premier League. This was a fourth defeat in five away games for Sean Dyche’s team, leaving them with a solitary point and a single goal from their travels, and it was alarming to see the way in which they were so brutally exposed defensively.\n\nAlbion, in fairness, were excellent and on another evening they could have scored even more than four. James Morrison left the field to a standing ovation after an outstanding performance, Salomón Rondón led the line superbly and Matt Phillips showed some lovely touches. All three of those players were on the scoresheet, along with Darren Fletcher, as Albion ran riot.\n\nOn the back of their victory at the Premier League champions prior to the international break, which ended Leicester’s 14-month unbeaten home record, Albion are now up to ninth in the table and it is a measure of how much the mood has changed that long before half-time Pulis was responding to requests from the fans in the Smethwick End to “give us a wave”.\n\nThree goals in the first 37 minutes certainly helped and effectively killed the game on a night when Dyche described his players as “weak-willed” and lamented the way in which his team “got drunk on keeping the ball”.\n\nIt was the first time this season that Burnley have had more than 50% of possession in a match – Albion came into the game with the same record so something had to give – and Dyche’s players could be forgiven for thinking that they are better off without the ball after this chastening experience.\n\nThere were less than four minutes on the clock when the rout started and Burnley never recovered. “A real head scratcher for us,” Dyche said. “I was really surprised with the first half, we were miles off what we do, we got drunk on keeping the ball, tried to overplay with no tempo. They were miles stronger than us in all departments in the first half. They had a mini-break for the first goal, but beyond that we just looked weak-willed and happy to pass it around without ever affecting them.”\n\nFor Pulis, it was a hugely satisfactory evening and he looked almost a little embarrassed afterwards when he was asked about being serenaded by the Albion fans. “Obviously it’s enjoyable, but when you take the stick … you’ve got to have a strong character both ways,” the Albion manager said. “I’m very pleased for the supporters, they could easily have given it a miss and watched it on TV but they’ve come out.”\n\nPhillips got Albion up and running after Dean Marney tried to intercept Morrison’s cross but succeeded only in diverting the ball into the path of the Albion winger. With his back to goal, Phillips turned Ben Mee far too easily and lifted the ball into the roof of the net past an exposed Tom Heaton after just four minutes.\n\nAs poor as Burnley were in the first half, they should have equalised in the 14th minute when Jeff Hendrick latched onto Sam Vokes’ knock down only to lift his shot the wrong side of the far post. Albion were not so generous at the other end when Morrison ran clear moments later. Rondón expertly held off Michael Keane just inside the Burnley half and released Morrison, who accepted the invitation to carry the ball forward as Mee backed off and stroked a precise shot inside Heaton’s near post. It was a lovely finish.\n\nBurnley looked shell-shocked and it seemed a matter of time before Albion added a third. Morrison curled wide after a mistake by Heaton, who atoned for that error when he brilliantly turned Rondón’s shot over the angle of crossbar and post. Yet there was nothing that the Burnley goalkeeper could do about Albion’s third as the unmarked Fletcher turned in Phillips’ superb cross. In doing so Fletcher became the third Scotland international to get on the scoresheet.\n\nDyche had seen enough and replaced Steven Defour with Ashley Barnes at the interval – “I could have taken at least nine of them off,” the Burnley manager later admitted – but the complexion of the game never changed and it was just a matter of how many Albion would score.\n\nRondón eventually got the goal his performance warranted in the 64th minute. Allan Nyom, set free by Morrison, cut the ball back for the Venezuelan striker, who turned sharply before drilling a low shot that beat Heaton via a deflection off Stephen Ward."}, {"date":

had he nipped out at half-time and visited the NHS health bus in Middlesbrough’s carpark offering fans mini check-ups.\n\nWatching the Italian’s technical-area histrionics it would have been easy to imagine his side were locked in a desperate relegation struggle rather than en route to going top of the Premier League courtesy of a sixth successive win.\n\nConsidering Chelsea have failed to concede a single goal during that sequence Conte generally has cause for serenity but on this occasion at least, his extreme agitation was at least partially justified by an ultra-determined, sporadically dangerous Middlesbrough.\n\nNo matter that Diego Costa’s winning volley from a badly defended corner reignited Teesside’s relegation worries, Adama Traoré’s pace and the midfield steel of Aitor Karanka’s two Adams, Clayton and Forshaw, left Chelsea looking slightly relieved to escape with all three points.\n\nKaranka’s switch from his beloved, if sometimes rather rigid, 4‑2‑3‑1 formation to a much more flexible version of 4‑3‑3 helped a recent mini-renaissance featuring draws at Arsenal and Manchester City. It did not serve him too badly here either but Boro’s problem is that while they never look in danger of a thrashing they have won only twice all season and have a costly habit of making one unfortunate error per match.\n\nThe Teesside side started well with Gastón Ramírez troubling Victor Moses, the right wing-back in Conte’s transformative 3-4-3 system, and helping create an early chance which saw Álvaro Negredo – seeking his first goal since the season’s opening day – slice over from six yards. Unfortunately it proved to be the cue for a disappointing, less than mobile afternoon for the Spanish centre-forward which must have made Jordan Rhodes, once again sidelined, wonder precisely what he has to do to get a game.\n\nIf only Negredo had shown some of Ramírez’s ambition. Later, some woeful decision-making would let the Uruguayan down but, initially, he briefly looked capable of eclipsing even Eden Hazard – although it hardly helped the latter’s cause that he appeared to be singled out for some rough stuff by Karanka’s midfield.\n\nAfter seeing Hazard clattered by a trio of early challenges, Jon Moss, the referee, finally booked Clayton for a particularly ruthless late lunge at the Belgian’s ankle.\n\nIf Hazard’s targeting cannot have been a shock, Conte looked affronted by Boro’s surprisingly effective amalgam of caution and aggression. Superbly compact as Chelsea advanced, with Clayton and Forshaw intelligence personified, Karanka’s players were not frightened to counterattack, utilising Traoré’s blistering, if ill-disciplined, pace to, at times, perturb the visiting back three.\n\nYaya Touré makes spectacular return to clinch Manchester City victory Read more\n\nIt meant, until Costa’s goal, Victor Valdés enjoyed a fairly peaceful first half. Admittedly the former Barcelona and Manchester United goalkeeper made one outstanding save when he diverted Pedro’s goalbound shot for a corner following exemplary approach work from Hazard and Moses, but he was largely well protected.\n\nAs half-time approached Costa had been largely anonymous, with Ben Gibson and Calum Chambers keeping him uncommonly quiet but then, in the 41st minute, a chance finally fell the centre-forward’s way and, typically, he was in the right place at the right time to seize it.\n\nHazard sent a corner looping high into the raw November air and no Boro player reacted properly. Valdés, who had just received lengthy treatment for an injury, should arguably have come for the ball as it looped up, while Gibson and Marten de Roon were among those who seemed to lose concentration. It left Costa free to meet a deflection, extend his left foot and volley his 10th goal of the season into the bottom corner from six yards.\n\nAs befits a world-class striker, he needed only a single opening to score but Costa had already caught the eye courtesy of some radically improved discipline. Hats off to Conte for eliminating the frequent am-dram theatrics which so annoyed opponents and officials when the striker served under José Mourinho.\n\nMiddlesbrough 0-1 Chelsea: Premier League – as it happened! Read more\n\nWith Chelsea galvanised, the second half began with Moses and Hazard creating an opening for Marcos Alonso – guilty of an earlier bad miss – repelled by Valdés, with Chambers then doing well to block Pedro’s attempt to pounce on the rebound.\n\nBy now Moses was increasingly influential as he delighted in reminding everyone that Fábio da Silva was deputising for the injured George Friend at left-back and it was his first appearance of the season. Sensibly Karanka replaced Da Silva with Stewart Downing after an hour.\n\nAs icy rain poured down Clayton and De Roon began reasserting themselves against N’Golo Kanté and co, and Ramírez shot over the bar.\n\nChelsea’s minds seemed to be suddenly wandering and it took some extreme touchline gyrations from Conte – cutting an infinitely livelier, more agile figure than Negredo – until they refocused and Pedro’s shot hit the bar following fine work from David Luiz and Costa.\n\nDeep into the second half Thibaut Courtois had still to make a significant save but when the call to arms eventually came Chelsea’s goalkeeper proved equal to it, saving Negredo’s shot superbly after Traoré’s pace caught his defence cold.\n\nMiddlesbrough are unlikely to be the last team similarly

His 12th attempt did at least end satisfactorily, whereas his bête noire, who had spent parts of the first half sniping in the Frenchman’s direction, talked darkly of it feeling like a defeat, while still making sure he got in the last word. “Finally, I lost against Arsène,” was Mourinho’s parting shot, then repeating it for added effect.\n\nMourinho was entitled to be crestfallen because Juan Mata’s expertly taken goal, midway through the second half, had put United in command on an afternoon that finished with their manager also announcing they should officially be known as “the unlucky team in the Premier League”.

Theo Walcott flickered only sporadically.\n\nAaron Ramsey struggled to have a telling impact on the left and, though Alexis Sánchez worked tirelessly, it was perplexing to see Wenger’s team look so meek against a side missing three-quarters of their usual defence.\n\nThe flipside for Arsenal is that it is not a bad thing for a team to avoid defeat on the days when they struggle to be at their more cohesive and Wenger can be hugely encouraged by the fact Giroud’s late feat of escapology means they have lost only one of their last 22 top-division fixtures. “There is something in our squad that is remarkable,” Wenger said. “It is great resilience and a never-give-up attitude.”\n\nIt is also the first time United have drawn three successive home games in the league since 1992 and, with the previous assignments coming against Burnley and Stoke City, Old Trafford has seen more disappointment than its regulars probably imagined from Mourinho’s opening months in the dugout. Once the frustration subsides a little, however, they can at least be encouraged by what Mourinho described as a performance of “amazing control”. Mata had a splendid game, as did his compatriot Ander Herrera, whereas Paul Pogba is showing now why he was the priority signing in the new manager’s first transfer window.\n\nPogba started in central midfield but took up a more advanced role after Wayne Rooney’s 63rd-minute introduction led to a change of order in the attacking positions. Rooney played at the forward tip, Marcus Rashford took over from the substituted Anthony Martial on the left, and Pogba was involved in the move, five minutes later, that finished with Mata cracking in a low shot from Herrera’s cutback.\n\nSouthampton v Liverpool, Crystal Palace v Man City and more – live! Read more\n\nWenger talked afterwards about his side having a “mental block” on their visits to Old Trafford, this being the 10th successive occasion in the league that they have returned without winning. “We did not play with our usual style,” the Arsenal manager added. Unfortunately for United, Rashford’s move to a wide position also meant the teenager taking on defensive responsibilities and he did not see them through when Oxlade-Chamberlain went past him to clip over the right-wing cross for Giroud’s goal.\n\nThe equaliser brought back into focus the 35th-minute incident that left Mourinho on the point of spontaneous combustion on the touchline, adamant that the referee, Andre Marriner, was mistaken to give Nacho Monreal the benefit of the doubt for his challenge on Antonio Valencia inside the penalty area.\n\nMourinho might have had a case given that Monreal, losing his balance, held out his right arm and leant into Valencia. United’s manager could be seen screaming to the skies, charging out of his technical area and so anguished that, at one point, he held his hand over his eyes as if to signal that he could no longer bear to watch what these wretched referees would do to him next. A more considered view would be that it was a difficult incident to judge and, though United probably had grounds to feel aggrieved, it would be exaggerating to think of it as an obvious penalty.\n\n“My view is that it was not a penalty, and you will not be surprised by that,” Wenger said. “Mourinho’s view is that it was a penalty, and you will not be surprised by that.”"}, {"date":

this week from Yaya Touré’s agent, the Spaniard’s bête noire Dimitri Seluk, demanding his client is handed a pay rise. After all those much publicised “misunderstandings in the past”, for which the player had recently, if belatedly, apologised, Touré is restored to the fray and contributing significantly once again. The absence has done little to blunt his dramatic timing.\n\nHe was decisive with two goals to condemn Crystal Palace to yet another defeat, a fifth in succession, while hoisting Manchester City on to the shoulder of league leaders Liverpool. Touré was clapped back into the visitors’ dressing room by his team-mates and already boasts as many Premier League goals this season as Paul Pogba across Manchester with United. He will be aching on Sunday, his body screaming in protest after a first league start in six months, but a player who had felt a fading memory of a bygone era only a few weeks ago suddenly appears to be an asset again.\n\n“I was desperate to play because it has been so difficult for me,” said Touré in the aftermath, with that a brief acknowledgement to the months of exile which were finally ended with an apology. “My team-mates are very important to me and have always been brilliant, and I was prepared mentally. I knew, one day, my manager would need me again.”\n\nSeamus Coleman breaks Swansea hearts with late equaliser for Everton Read more\n\nThat day arrived here. Guardiola will never see eye to eye with the unrepentant Seluk, whose outbursts had prompted the schism, but the cessation of that stand-off with the midfielder could yet prove significant in this team’s title pursuit. This was a slog against a Palace side desperate to arrest a recent alarming slide, the contest degenerating into a scrap from its opening exchanges. But, where City goalkeeper Claudio Bravo kept out Christian Benteke and Jason Puncheon poked wide, Touré capitalised on the visitors’ clearest sights of goal.\n\nHe had been sauntering on the periphery up to the moment another member of the old guard, Vincent Kompany, trudged off dizzied by a head injury. With him went leadership, with Touré filling the breach. The hosts had always felt vulnerable when Raheem Sterling tested the unconvincing Martin Kelly, though Palace did not help their makeshift left-back. In the 39th minute there was indecision from James McArthur and a poorly directed pass from Andros Townsend before Kelly, unnerved by Sterling’s presence, blindly scuffed a clearance in-field to Kevin De Bruyne on the edge of the box. City patiently pulled markers out of position before Touré swapped passes with Nolito and saw his shot flick up from James Tomkins and in.\n\nThat was his first league goal since March though a second, seven minutes from time, would be required to claim victory. City had been stung by Palace’s 66th-minute equaliser, their pressure oppressive thereafter, but would end up prospering from a set piece as so many have against the home side’s rearguard to date this term. De Bruyne’s corner was clever, slid into the six-yard box with Palace braced to repel an aerial assault. The hosts had not replaced the substituted Benteke at the near post, but more mystifying was their slackness in leaving Touré, a man-mountain, unattended in the centre. Even he looked surprised to be presented with a tap-in.\n\n“He is a special player,” said Guardiola. “I would say his performance is not down to my decision [to select him], but it’s about his quality. Yaya’s physical condition is better than ever. He’s now a real part of the team again and can help us achieve our targets. We need this kind of player. But you know the reason why he has not been playing up to now…”\n\nLiverpool left frustrated as dogged Southampton hold on for a draw Read more\n\nGuardiola’s admission that City had been “lucky”, having been made “so uncomfortable” by Palace’s aggressive approach, was no consolation for the locals. Some of the home support, united pre-match and during the game in memory of those who lost their lives in the Croydon tram derailment earlier this month, took their frustrations out on Alan Pardew, with the team now hovering a point above the relegation zone and pointless since September.\n\nThis was a more combative and even organised performance, with Connor Wickham’s rasping shot having deservedly forced them level midway through the second half. But there is disorganisation and panic at key times, with Touré’s winner now added to a lengthy list of unforgivable concessions from set-plays. Pardew claimed that “is not us” but recent history suggests it has become the norm.\n\nSaturday’s trip to Swansea already feels critical. “It doesn’t look good at the moment with the results we’ve had,” added Pardew. “And yet our performances suggest we can turn it around. We need to do that quickly. I’m comfortable that we have a good distance to get ourselves in a better place, and we have games coming up where we need to take points.”\n\nPardew’s side were watched here by the major shareholder, Josh Harris.

After 90, they were on the floor emotionally and literally as Seamus Coleman’s late equaliser steered them to the bottom of the Premier League. “Clearly the road ahead is long and hard,” rued their American coach. “But it is one we can definitely handle.”\n\nThe league table, a sequence of 11 Premier League fixtures without a win and the blow to morale dealt by Everton’s salvage operation suggests otherwise.\n\nYet those “angry and disappointed” players in the away changing room produced a performance that warranted Bradley’s optimism and the belief that all is far from lost in south Wales. Not that this sickening setback will be easy to shake.\n\n“We can find some positive things in there,” said the former United States coach. “The work to turn our season around has to continue.\n\n“There is no other way. Every game is a must-win now. There’s no forgetting that. It’s 12 games gone and you can see the position we are in in the table but there is still belief in that dressing room. There are still players coming into training every week knowing we can do it.”\n\nSwansea were superior throughout the first half as Everton served up an abysmal display rectified only by greater energy after an interval rollicking and Coleman’s 89th-minute header. Ronald Koeman may have upset his own fans with talk of Romelu Lukaku moving on to bigger and better things and Liverpool’s title prospects but a run of one win in seven league games is cause for deeper concern.\n\nBoth managers had demanded reactions from dreadful performances that preceded the international break but only Bradley sparked one. His Swansea team played with purpose, energy and organisation – all the ingredients that were absent from their 3-1 home defeat by Manchester United – and thoroughly deserved the interval lead provided by Gylfi Sigurdsson’s penalty.\n\nPerversely, Everton created clearer openings in the first half while appearing to be still dazed and confused by the 5-0 mauling at Chelsea a fortnight ago. Koeman’s team lacked urgency, struggled to retain possession and appeared to have no plan of attack other than to hope for the best from Lukaku.\n\nThey were dreadful, and left in no doubt over the crowd’s opinion as boos filled Goodison on the half-time whistle. “I was really disappointed and angry at half time,” said Koeman. “I expected the reaction to Chelsea from the start of the game and not from the start of the second half.”\n\nSigurdsson, one of only three survivors from the team that rolled over against Manchester United earlier this month, scored from the penalty spot when Phil Jagielka, making his 300th Premier League start, suffered another lapse inside his area.\n\nBournemouth’s Nathan Ake scores only goal to bag vital away win at Stoke Read more\n\nEverton’s captain was caught up in the controversy over Wayne Rooney’s late night socialising while on England duty and caught out when Sigurdsson reacted quicker to Modou Barrow’s flick into the area, prompting Jagielka to pull him down.\n\nMaarten Stekelenburg twice rescued Jagielka when the England international conceded two penalties at Manchester City but there was no chance of the hat-trick. The keeper went low to his right and Sigurdsson stroked the penalty high to his left for his fourth league goal of the campaign.\n\nKoeman’s team conjured chances their performance rarely suggested they were capable of but Lukaku deflected Yannick Bolasie’s driven cross over the bar with his thigh from two yards out, Ross Barkley scuffed wide having turned Federico Fernández in the area and Bolasie shot straight at Fabianski when put clean through by Lukaku.\n\nThe second half brought improvement in Everton’s work-rate yet there was little in the way of quality or threat from the hosts until Bolasie hoisted a hopeful ball into the box that Jordi Amat could only head into the air.

Instead Liverpool departed the south coast ruing the missed opportunities that checked their momentum and allowed Southampton to escape with a point.\n\nPhilippe Coutinho, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mané, Liverpool’s exhilarating attacking trident, all found themselves in promising positions during a one-sided contest, but the combination of some excellent goalkeeping from Fraser Forster and wayward finishing prevented the visitors from capitalising on their dominance.\n\nSeamus Coleman breaks Swansea hearts with late equaliser for Everton Read more\n\nIt was certainly not for a lack of trying. Klopp was like a cheerleader at times as he danced around on the touchline, throwing his arms in the air and urging his players on as they poured forward in search of a breakthrough. The Liverpool manager’s desperation for the goal that would have extended their lead at the top of the table also shone through in the substitution that brought Daniel Sturridge on to replace Emre Can and that so nearly produced a reward.\n\nNine minutes from time, Sturridge wriggled clear on the left with a neat piece of footwork and floated a deep and inviting centre towards the back post. It was a former Southampton player on the end of the cross, but probably not the one that Klopp would have chosen. Nathaniel Clyne, from about eight yards out, headed inches wide of Forster’s far upright.\n\n“It was a brilliant situation. Unfortunately for Clyney he was the most surprised person maybe in the stadium,” Klopp said.\n\n“This could have been a goal. Roberto could have scored, Phil could have scored, Sadio in the first half, so we had these moments, but that’s good.\n\n“I am fine with the performance, absolutely. We could gave scored, maybe we should have scored, but that’s how football is and very often in my life my teams lost games like this when we were so much better and had much more chances. We didn’t lose today because we stayed concentrated, and that’s very important for us.\n\n“Everybody could see this season that on a very good day we are able to score fantastic goals. But today was much more difficult. Then, staying in the game is the best news we can get. So I am not happy, but I’m fine.”\n\nKlopp, however, ought to have been feeling much better than fine at the end of a damp and cold afternoon in Southampton. It was one-way traffic as Saints sat deep and Liverpool moved the ball with confidence.\n\nKlopp’s team enjoyed 65% of possession, made 663 passes compared with Southampton’s 371, registered 15 shots on goal against Southampton’s three and were 8-1 winners on the corner count. Liverpool, in short, did everything but put the ball in the back of the net and only time will tell whether the two points that slipped through their fingers here prove costly.\n\nSouthampton were grimly holding on at times, aided by Forster’s goalkeeping and another impressive display from Virgil van Dijk. As an attacking force they offered little, with the isolated Charlie Austin’s second-half header a rare chance for the home team in what was essentially a backs-to-the-wall performance.\n\nLiverpool’s first presentable opportunity arrived in the 28th minute, when Mané, returning to St Mary’s for the first time since his £34m move to Anfield in the summer, swept a curling, powerful shot that was arcing towards the top corner until Forster flicked it over the crossbar with his fingertips. Mané escaped again moments later, but Van Dijk got across superbly to block.\n\nWhile Van Dijk was fortunate not to be punished for tugging Firmino’s shirt shortly after the interval, Liverpool only had themselves to blame for the profligacy that followed.\n\nCoutinho, set free by Firmino after Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg had carelessly given away the ball, sliced wide with only Forster to beat. José Fonte had made up plenty of ground to put Coutinho under pressure, but it was still a position from which the Brazilian would have expected to score.\n\nYaya Touré makes spectacular return to clinch Manchester City victory Read more\n\nThe same was true for the golden opportunity that Firmino squandered in the 66th minute, with Coutinho this time the provider. Darting runs from Mané and Georginio Wijnaldum opened up space for Firmino, who was beautifully found by Coutinho’s measured pass, yet the striker steered a low shot with the outside of his boot just wide of Forster’s far post.\n\nCan later dragged a low shot wide, Clyne headed off target and Firmino’s effort was repelled by Forster as Southampton just about stood firm.\n\n“We played a very good team,” Claude Puel, the Southampton manager, said. “When they lose the ball they recover it very well. It’s difficult to develop our game. Today, we have won one point.”"}, {"date": "19/11/2016", "arena": "Bet365 Stadium", "attendance": 27815, "home_team": {"name": "Stoke City", "lineup": [{"name": "Lee Grant", "yellows": [], "reds": [],

plans to speak with referee Roger East after feeling key decisions went against his side in their victory against Stoke, while his opposite number Mark Hughes railed against the visitors’ “cynical time-wasting”.\n\nIt could have been a tale of two penalties at the Bet365 Stadium had the Cherries not held on to the 26th-minute lead given to them by Nathan Aké’s header to see out a 1-0 win.\n\nThe first moment of controversy came in the 11th minute as East handed the hosts a reprieve when Jack Wilshere’s beautifully weighted pass sent Callum Wilson through on goal with Ryan Shawcross in tow.\n\nThe Stoke defender felled Wilson with a sliding challenge from behind inside the penalty area but East, to the astonishment of Howe and the majority of the 27,815 in attendance, did not award the spot-kick and waved away the appeals.\n\nWatford strike early to heap more misery on Leicester City’s title defence Read more\n\nReplays showed Bournemouth had been hard done by while Stoke should arguably have been contesting the remainder of the match with 10 men.\n\nThe attention was on East again early in the second half as this time he awarded a penalty following Bojan Krkic’s theatrical fall after Simon Francis trod on his foot. The Spaniard took the penalty himself but crashed his shot against the crossbar.\n\nAsked about the incidents, Howe said: “At half-time I tend to focus on the team and what I can change in the second half, there’s no point chasing officials or trying to make your point that way.\n\nOlivier Giroud denies Manchester United and rescues point for Arsenal Read more\n\n“But I will be speaking to them on Monday morning to get clarity on the decisions because I felt the two big decisions in the game he got wrong, in my opinion. The first one for us is a clear penalty and I don’t think the one he gives them is a penalty.\n\n“It’s difficult enough having to come here when officials get all the decisions right, never mind when the two major ones in the game go against you.”\n\nThe Stoke manager, Mark Hughes, admitted he felt his team were lucky to get away with Shawcross’ tackle on Wilson. He said: “It’s a difficult one. I think he’s made an attempt to get the ball. Maybe the referee thought the ball had got away from their player a bit as it run through to the goalkeeper but yes, we got away with one there.”\n\nHowever, he criticised Howe’s side for what he felt were unsportsmanlike tactics during the second half. “I felt they were a little bit cynical in terms of their time wasting,” said Hughes. “We’ve all been there where we’ve been the away side trying to hold on to a lead – I’ve done it myself. I’m not against it but I’ve never seen it to the extent that I saw today to be perfectly honest.\n\nYaya Touré makes spectacular return to clinch Manchester City victory Read more\n\n“From minute one of the second half they showed their intent to slow the game down. We’ve played six minutes at the end of the game, it could have been 16 given all the stoppages.\n\n“We clearly needed momentum and the game to flow so we could get some intensity in our play and that was difficult in the second half because of the time wasting. But it is what it is and we should have converted any number of chances that we created, but we didn’t.”\n\nDespite periods of pressure, Stoke struggled to really trouble Bournemouth. Their best chances of an equalising goal both came in the final 10 minutes as Xherdan Shaqiri scooped a shot over from 12 yards out and Jonathan Walters headed tamely at goalkeeper Adam Federici."},

plunged Wearside into darkness but, once generators kicked in and play finally resumed, Victor Anichebe effectively switched the lights back on for Sunderland.\n\nAnichebe is far from the most prolific of strikers but, suddenly galvanised, he became almost unplayable, scoring two goals which finally lifted David Moyes side off the bottom of the Premier League and made survival seem an increasingly feasible proposition.\n\nYaya Touré makes spectacular return to clinch Manchester City victory Read more\n\nWith Jermain Defoe also on the scoresheet, Jason Denayer impressing in a holding midfield capacity and Jordan Pickford excelling in goal, Sunderland not only recorded a second successive win but hauled Hull City back into deep trouble.\n\n“Victor was immense,” said Moyes, who, addressing a dimly lit media conference, acknowleded Hull had “several” chances. “Victor needs to be loved but he was immense today - and some of the saves Jordan Pickford made were unbelievable.”\n\nMIke Phelan could barely credit some of his side’s misses. “We didn’t take our chances,” said the visiting manager. “It’s frustrating and annoying. At the end of a week in which a Chinese consortium abandoned interest in buying the East Yorkshire club, Phelan reverted to a flat back four, offering 17-year-old Josh Tymon a League debut at left back. With a five-man midfield behind Dieumerci Mbokani - Hull’s lone, not to mention sole fit, striker - his side started well, initially monopolising possession to an almost embarrassing extent.\n\nSam Clucas looked particularly classy in midfield, his manoeuvres leaving Moyes with a deep, seemingly semi-permanent, frown. Fortunately for Sunderland’s manager, all this ball hogging merely produced a few half chances - although, significantly, Pickford did save smartly from Mkobani and, later, Clucas.\n\nIndeed by deploying Denayer - integral to home victory - in that quasi sweeping role and asking Paddy McNair to help Patrick van Aanholt out in subduing the dangerous Robert Snodgrass, Moyes seemed to have hit upon a reasonably successful containment strategy.\n\nMoreover as the minutes ticked by and home nerves slowly steadied, his side began threatening on the break. They might well have had a penalty when David Marshall charged into Duncan Watmore, sending the winger crashing. In another dangerous cameo, Tymon justified his place by bravely heading the ball away under acute pressure from Anichebe after Marshall tipped Watmore’s cross into the forward’s path.\n\nDefoe specialises in asking questions defenders cannot answer and, sure enough, Hull’s had no answers to him in the 34th minute. Sunderland fans dare not imagine where they might be without the former England striker and, once again, Defoe eased considerable local pressure, courtesy of his 150th Premier League goal.\n\nIt arrived after Watmore flicked on a long ball, wrong-footing a confounded Michael Dawson. With Dawson effectively removed from the equation, Defoe delighted in dodging first Curtis Davies and then Ahmed Elmohamady before shifting the ball onto his left foot and shooting low beyond Marshall.\n\nThe second half had barely begun before the electricity supply to the floodlights failed, prefacing a dusky 10 minute hiatus. Once light had been restored, Hull might swiftly have equalised but Ryan Mason lost his cool and shot wide from 12 yards after Snodgrass’s skill created an excellent chance.\n\nInstead it was Sunderland who extended their lead when, meeting Van Aanholt’s delivery, Anichebe stepped inside Tymon and beat Marshall at his near post with a left foot shot.\n\nLiverpool left frustrated as dogged Southampton hold on for a draw Read more\n\nRefusing to give up, Snodgrass attempted an audacious, extremely clever, overhead kick which forced Pickford to perform acrobatics before somehow tipping the ball to safety. It was a brilliant save which further emphasised why it is surely only a matter of time until Pickford becomes England’s first choice keeper.\n\nHull saw a penalty appeal rejected when Clucas went down under Watmore’s challenge and had three headed chances in quick succession as Pickford saved brilliantly from Davies, Mbokani’s effort was cleared off the line and Jake Livermore’s blocked.\n\nAnichebe showed them how to score, meeting Defoe’s rolled pass before his first touch took him away from his minder and his second involved his lashing a third goal in two games in off a post.\n\nSunderland’s Papy Djilobodji was subsequently sent off for collecting a second yellow card but, by then, the lights had well and truly gone out for Hull."}, {"date": "19/11/2016", "arena":

Gone in 33 seconds here. That was how long it took Étienne Capoue to open the scoring for Watford, who quickly increased their lead thanks to a lovely goal by Roberto Pereyra. Riyad Mahrez converted a penalty for Leicester but the champions could not avert a fifth defeat from six Premier League away matches this season.\n\nAdd that to the fact that they lost their year-long unbeaten home league record in their last match at the King Power and Leicester’s title defence is beginning to bear an uncomfortable resemblance to a struggle against relegation. After 12 matches they are two points above the bottom three.\n\nLeicester will confirm progression to the knockout stages of the Champions League if the beat Club Brugge on Tuesday but their domestic troubles recall a different kind of history: Manchester City’s class of 1938 are the only English champions to have been relegated the year after winning the title.\n\nLeicester kicked off here as if intending to ease themselves into the game. That was a liberty Watford were not willing to give them. The hosts seized possession almost immediately and Pereyra embarked on a wriggly run down the left before clipping in a dangerous cross.\n\nTroy Deeney helped it on with a canny header and Capoue arrived to volley it into the net from 16 yards. It was a severe rebuke to the dozing visitors and the latest proof of Capoue’s increased deadliness from midfield: the Frenchman did not score at all last season but this was his fifth goal of this campaign.\n\nLiverpool left frustrated as dogged Southampton hold on for a draw Read more\n\nWatford had been trounced 6-1 by Liverpool in their last outing before the international break and their manager, Walter Mazzarri, had ordered his players to channel their anger at that result into their performance here.\n\nThey seemed intent on doing just that, which was bad news for any Leicester player hoping the hosts would lower the intensity after their early goal.\n\nInstead Watford, far more fluent and robust than the disjointed visitors, helped themselves to a second goal in the 12th minute. It was a work of beauty, too. Pereyra again made inroads down the left, turned sharply past Danny Drinkwater and curled a delicious shot beyond Ron-Robert Zieler and into the net from the left-hand corner of the box.\n\nDrinkwater was included in the starting lineup after passing a late fitness test but he and Daniel Amartey were regularly bypassed in the opening stages as Leicester reeled. Falling two goals behind finally provoked a reaction from the champions, who pulled a goal back in the 15th minute thanks to a successful penalty by Mahrez. The spot-kick had been awarded for a foul on Jamie Vardy despite Miguel Britos protesting that the striker had simply used an untidy challenge as an invitation to tumble. The home crowd made similar claims for the rest of the match, booing every decision given against Watford by referee Neil Swarbrick, who later booked Britos for nagging.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Leicester’s Danny Simpson reacts after being ruled offisde during the loss to Watford. Photograph: Christopher Lee/Getty Images\n\nLeicester improved as the match went on and began to corral Watford into their own half. But they seldom bothered Heurelho Gomes, who was well protected by a vigilant home defence. Watford came closest to scoring in the second half thanks to strong work down the right by Nordin Amrabat, who rounded Christian Fuchs and fed Daryl Janmaat, who calmly deposited the ball on to the head of Pereyra. The forward’s header from close-range was much more central than it should have been but still demanded a terrific save from Zieler.\n\nClaudio Ranieri made a trio of late substitutions and at last began to threaten an equaliser. But Watford were not about to let them off the hook, their defenders making repeated last-ditch blocks to hold on to victory.\n\nRanieri is not sounding the alarm. Just as he spent most of last season talking down Leicester’s title chances, he played up their performance here.\n\n“Watford scored two fantastic goals and then we did a very fantastic reaction,” said Ranieri. “Gomes didn’t make any saves but I think until the end we had a chance to score a goal because the team was alive. But against us today there was a big wall to stop all our shots at goal. We lost the match but the spirit is high.

Spurs dominated for long spells of this pulsating London derby but they needed Harry Kane, the most prolific of scorers in inter-capital fixtures, to strike twice in the final two minutes to transform a maiden defeat of the season into their first victory since 2 October.\n\nWest Ham had led twice, through Michail Antonio’s first-half goal and Manuel Lanzini’s 68th-minute penalty after Harry Winks made it 1-1 with a goal in his first league start, but a defensive substitution from Slaven Bilic five minutes from time proved desperately costly for the visiting team. They remain 17th and face a daunting set of fixtures, making their inability to close out the win all the more frustrating.\n\nYet the real story was how Kane, who is still working his way back to full fitness, scored twice to overturn the deficit. The first came after Son Heung-min’s cross was parried by Darren Randolph into the England striker’s path before a minute later Son was tripped by Havard Nordtveit in the area, giving Mike Dean no option but to point to the spot. Kane drilled it into the bottom left corner from 12 yards.\n\nBilic had introduced Nordtveit only six minutes earlier for Dimitri Payet, at a time when the France attacker was looking menacing on the break. Such a conservative change invited Spurs on and West Ham duly crumbled, with Nordtveit deserving much of the blame.\n\n“It looked good for us,” Bilic said. “Especially after the goal we scored, but we had good opportunities to kill the game off. Unfortunately it wasn’t to be.”\n\nLiverpool left frustrated as dogged Southampton hold on for a draw Read more\n\nHowever, one had to marvel at the drive displayed by Spurs. Pochettino reckoned they were “sloppy” during the first half, yet their self-belief did not wilt and with Kane on the pitch there was always a route to goal.\n\nHis tally in derbies is now 18 from 22, the best ratio of any striker in the Premier League era. “He’s back,” Pochettino said. “For me he’s one of the best strikers in the world and I’m very, very happy with his performance.”\n\nConsidering the history between these two, it was always going to be an exception to the unwritten rule that games immediately after the international break take time to ignite. Both were hungry to claim an early foothold and although Tottenham monopolised possession for much of the opening 45, Randolph had very little to do.\n\nPochettino’s decision to pair Kane with Vincent Janssen, believing two strikers would work best against West Ham’s three-man defence, did not work initially and Spurs were left short in wide areas when being countered.\n\nIn saying that, Antonio opened the scoring from a set piece. The wing-back had an initial effort blocked by Kyle Walker and from Payet’s corner Cheikhou Kouyaté’s header came off the bar. The rebound broke to Winston Reid, whose attempt took a heavy deflection and Antonio was in the right place to head past a scrambling Hugo Lloris from close range. It was his sixth goal of the season and all have been headers.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Michail Antonio gives West Ham the lead in the first half at White Hart Lane. Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PA\n\nAs half-time approached Pochettino grew exasperated with Tottenham’s lateral play and was apoplectic in the opening minutes of the second period when Mousa Dembélé dawdled under a high ball, allowing Diafra Sakho to muscle in and intercept. He fed Payet, who cruised goalwards but was halted by a terrific tackle from Jan Vertonghen.\n\nThose frustrations were soon relieved when Winks tapped home at the conclusion of Spurs’ first proper flowing move of the evening. Danny Rose advanced speedily down the left and found Janssen at the near post. His shot was parried to the feet of Winks, who tucked home.\n\nOlivier Giroud denies Manchester United and rescues point for Arsenal Read more\n\nThere was no mistaking the added purpose to Spurs’ football at that point and only a brilliant Randolph save to deny Eric Dier stopped them from taking the lead just before the hour. Yet completely against the run of play West Ham retook the advantage when Janssen had his arm around the shoulder of Reid from a corner and Dean immediately pointed to the spot. Lanzini sent Lloris the wrong way.\n\nIt was all going well for the Hammers but when Payet, their main creative outlet, was removed it became a backs against the wall job and eventually the pressure told – to such an extent that Reid was booked twice in injury time and will now miss Sunday’s trip to Manchester United.\n\n“We were better than West Ham,” Pochettino said. “One team deserved to win the game and it was Tottenham, no doubt.

Arsenal’s manager briefly tried to argue that Victor Wanyama should have been sent off and made an even less convincing case that Tottenham Hotspur’s penalty should not have been awarded on the basis that Laurent Koscielny’s foul was not deliberate, dangerous or denying Mousa Dembélé a scoring opportunity – absolutely none of which matter a jot if one is going to be old-fashioned and apply the rules.\n\nThankfully Wenger did eventually return to a far more legitimate point, accepting that Arsenal had lost their way in a second half that was a reminder of Tottenham’s competitive qualities. “Our level dropped,” Wenger said. “We looked flat, physically.” The same could not be said of their opponents and, though Tottenham have now gone seven games without a win in all competitions, on this evidence it would be misleading to think Mauricio Pochettino is overseeing a team in distress.\n\nPochettino’s men showed the kind of togetherness that made them authentic title contenders last season. They are not passing the ball as fluently but Dele Alli was ruled out with a knee injury and Harry Kane is still short of fitness, lasting only until the 72nd minute on his first start in seven weeks. Spurs still look better with him back in the team and perhaps a fully firing Kane would have accepted one of the chances he missed either side of scoring their penalty.\n\nLiverpool v Watford: Premier League – live! Read more\n\nThe second one, in particular, looked like the kind of chance Kane would usually accept and Tottenham could also reflect on the moment, late on, when Christian Eriksen’s free-kick curled beyond everyone and bounced off a post. That would have been lucky but Pochettino’s men had finished as the more likely winners in a compelling, fluctuating match when the speed and frequency with which the game swung from one end of the pitch to the other created an absorbing spectacle.\n\nArsenal, however, undoubtedly finished with the greater sense of exasperation. Spurs had started encouragingly but the home team produced some thrilling attacking football when they took command during a 20-minute spell of sustained pressure late in the first half, bringing an own goal from Kevin Wimmer and several other chances. “In the first half we looked like we could score every time we crossed the halfway line,” Wenger said.\n\nPochettino was certainly taking a gamble by experimenting for the first time with an unorthodox 3-3-2-2 formation in such a key fixture and it was not easy at that stage to remember the visitors had the best defensive record in the league. Theo Walcott and Alexis Sánchez caused them plenty of problems, with Mesut Özil always in close proximity, and Alex Iwobi really should have given Arsenal the lead after the best passing exchange of the first half. Iwobi trundled his shot into the arms of Hugo Lloris with so little conviction it was tempting to question his big-game mentality. The same player later chose the wrong pass from another threatening break, provoking a rare show of anger from Özil, before Walcott almost scored a beauty with a rising 25-yard shot that rattled Lloris’s left post, close to its point with the crossbar.\n\nArsenal 1-1 Tottenham Hotspur: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nTottenham did, however, have legitimate grievances about the opening goal on the basis that Sánchez and Shkodran Mustafi had both strayed offside when Özil curled over the free-kick that led to Wimmer heading into his own net. Wimmer was making his first appearance in the Premier League this season, brought in as part of a new-look three-man central defence, and his only possible mitigation could be that the two offside players were in his line of vision. Even then the Austrian defender should have avoided what happened next.\n\nArsenal have lost only one of these fixtures at their own stadium in the last 23 years but there is another statistic that says they have not beaten Spurs in the league during the Pochettino era and Wenger did not really find wholehearted support in his post-match complaints about Wanyama’s first-half clash with Walcott.\n\nDembélé’s switch to a slightly more deep-lying position was a subtle yet important change for the second half. Eriksen became more influential and Son Heung-min was prominently involved, with Danny Rose operating as a wing-back and Kyle Walker doing the same on the other side until he was forced off in the second half with an injury.\n\n“You need to be flexible,” Pochettino said of the new system. “In the last month we’ve had some small problems so we tried to find a better solution with our full-backs higher up the pitch. We showed a strong performance and we worked hard.”\n\nDembélé still had the licence to roam forward and it was his run from right to left, eluding Francis Coquelin and then coming inside Nacho Monreal, that prompted Koscielny to make the challenge that led to the penalty five minutes after the interval.

Instead the richly gifted and grimly determined Scotland winger proved his fitness for this week’s World Cup qualifier with England by stepping off the bench and offering Mike Phelan’s side a lifeline.\n\nBy extending his left foot to lash a superbly assured equaliser inside a post and then providing the perfectly weighted, subtly curving, free-kick from which Michael Dawson secured Hull’s first League victory since August, Snodgrass transformed a contest that an initially superior Southampton should have won by a country mile.\n\nIt meant that, at the end of a grey, wet, raw Humberside afternoon on which anyone who neglected to wear gloves made a major tactical error, Phelan’s horizon had brightened appreciably.\n\n“It was a big, big risk to bring Snoddy on that early,” said Hull’s manager whose hand was forced by an injury to Will Keane. “But it turned things our way. Snoddy can do things other players can’t. Once again he’s showed his quality.”\n\nPlayed against a soundtrack of “Allams out” from those home fans who had bothered to turn up – the stadium was only two-thirds full – the first half was embarrassingly one-sided. For prolonged periods Southampton appeared to inhabit a different stratosphere with their slick pass-and-move game monopolising possession and proving virtually impossible for Phelan’s players to second guess.\n\nWith Nathan Redmond prominent, they cut through Hull with the almost inappropriate ruthlessness of a power tool slicing a soufflé.\n\nClaude Puel’s side assumed an early lead after Curtis Davies needlessly hauled Maya Yoshida down and Charlie Austin sent David Marshall the wrong way from the penalty spot. It was Austin’s fifth goal in seven games and eighth of the season – how come so many managers, for so long, kept muttering that he was “not a Premier League class striker”?\n\nPoor Phelan would simply be content to have a full complement of fit forwards. Emphasising that Hull’s manager is certainly not having much luck with injuries, Abel Hernández quickly pulled up with an injury and hobbled off, to be replaced by Dieumerci Mbokani. Then, minutes later, Keane sustained knee damage which Phelan conceded “looks serious”.\n\nAgain there was no contact with a Southampton player but Keane fell awkwardly and was helped off appearing extremely upset. On came Snodgrass in that ultimately game-changing switch. Initially, though, the difference proved incremental and his brutal exposure of Ryan Bertrand’s limitations took time to become fully apparent.\n\nUntil then Hull’s most optimistic moment had involved a prospective opposition dismissal. When Dusan Tadic launched himself into an awful, late, studs-up, knee-high challenge on the mercifully unhurt Ryan Mason in what was not so much a tackle as an assault, a red card beckoned but Graham Scott merely issued Tadic with a yellow.\n\nHappily for Phelan visiting minds fatigued by Thursday night’s Europa League victory over Internazionale eventually began wandering, permitting Sam Clucas’s pass from the left to find Snodgrass.\n\nAs the winger’s left foot did the rest, sudden doubts entered the minds of the previously underemployed Fraser Forster and imperious Virgil van Dijk. They were compounded when Snodgrass curled in the free-kick from which Dawson out-leapt all comers to head the winner.\n\nMarshall subsequently made fine saves to deny Austin twice and Yoshida while Clucas contributed a stoppage-time clearance off the line but Hull held on to set the stage for an intriguing relegation “six-pointer” at Sunderland on Saturday week."}, {"date": "06/11/2016",

streaming out of Anfield before the end of a defeat by Crystal Palace. No one quits early any more. With his side top of the Premier League and turning on the style on a weekly basis, these are the days for Liverpool to savour.\n\nWatford were not simply the fifth of six visitors beaten at Anfield this season but the latest team to feel and suffer the punishing effect of the formidable attack constructed by Klopp. Walter Mazzarri’s side came with a proud defensive record to protect. It was obliterated inside 45 minutes as Liverpool swarmed to the Premier League summit for the first time since May 2014 with the kind of performance that suggests they might enjoy the view for a good while yet. Doubts may well surround Liverpool’s defensive ability at set pieces but there was not a soul inside Anfield who would complain at getting first place and one intense attacking display after another in exchange.\n\nOnce again, the incomparable front trident of Sadio Mané, Philippe Coutinho and Roberto Firmino punctured holes in the opposition backline. All three were on the scoresheet and Liverpool were three up before the break as Watford wilted under relentless pressure. The only surprise was that the visitors’ record of not conceding a Premier League goal stretched to five hours and 25 minutes as Liverpool had eight presentable chances to score before Mané commenced the onslaught with a cute header. The Senegal international scored the fifth, too, before being substituted to a standing ovation. “If we still had Suárez,” the Kop sang, “he’d be on the bench.” That may have been tongue in cheek but the tribute to Liverpool’s collective power was merited. They have witnessed 13 different goalscorers in 14 matches this season and 10 in the Premier League alone.\n\nLiverpool v Watford: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nWatford also lost Heurelho Gomes to what appeared a serious injury to the goalkeeper’s right knee on a galling afternoon for the men from Vicarage Road. They would have been behind early had Firmino, Lucas Leiva – deputising for the ill Dejan Lovren in central defence – or Coutinho not missed clear openings. Confirming Liverpool’s threat is not confined to the front three, Emre Can and James Milner also had sight of Gomes’s goal before the dam burst.\n\nMané was involved in almost every Liverpool break in the first half. He broke the deadlock when Daryl Janmaat switched off at a short corner between Milner and Coutinho, enabling the former Southampton forward to steal a yard on the defender and steer the Brazilian’s cross home with his head.\n\nThree minutes later it was two as Nathaniel Clyne, Mané, Adam Lallana and Firmino combined to invite Coutinho to attack Watford’s central defence. Liverpool’s No10 duly obliged, cutting on to his right and driving a powerful low shot through the legs of Younès Kaboul and into the centre of the visitors’ goal. Gomes was unsighted but also beaten easily as his knee gave way while attempting to correct his body shape. The keeper was helped off in clear distress by two members of Watford’s medical staff. “It was a very bad knock but we won’t know how bad it is until he has been checked in the next days,” said the defeated manager.\n\nCan put the game beyond Mazzarri’s team before half-time when he read Lallana’s deep cross to perfection and headed the ball back across Gomes’s replacement, Costel Pantilimon, at the far post. It could have been four in the first half but for Pantilimon tipping away a Milner free-kick that looked destined for the top corner.\n\nNumber four did arrive from another flowing move, Lallana sweeping a low cross along the six-yard box for Firmino to convert at close range, before the Brazilian turned provider to set up Mané’s second of the game. Jordan Henderson released Firmino clear on the right after winning a clearance from Pantilimon, he looked up, surveyed his options and rolled a perfect ball on to Mané’s run for the striker to beat the keeper convincingly.\n\nJürgen Klopp says Liverpool can still improve after thrashing Watford Read more\n\nTo their credit, Watford did not take the hammering lying down and Loris Karius had to produce the first impressive saves of his Anfield career from Étienne Capoue and Miguel Britos before Janmaat, in acres of space inside the Liverpool area, steered a consolation into the far corner. But there was never any chance of Klopp’s side easing off.\n\nDaniel Sturridge twice struck the crossbar after coming on for Lallana and it was his shot, parried by Pantilimon, that enabled his fellow substitute Georginio Wijnaldum to score his first Liverpool goal from the rebound.\n\nSix goals and at number one. Klopp surveys a new main stand when he turns around to check for any early leavers these days. There is also a different team in front of him and different belief around him.

Serving a touchline ban, the Manchester United manager savoured the sight of his team registering their first Premier League victory in five matches as well as Zlatan Ibrahimovic rediscovering his touch in front of goal on an afternoon when Swansea City capitulated and the simmering frustration among their supporters started to boil over.\n\nIbrahimovic struck twice – his first goals in the Premier League since 10 September – after Paul Pogba had opened the scoring with an exquisite shot from distance that set the tone for an embarrassingly one-sided first half in which Swansea were outplayed. United were 3-0 up inside 33 minutes and it felt like a trick of the mind that Mourinho’s team had come into this game short of confidence and facing so many questions about their form.\n\nJosé Mourinho questions Manchester United players’ mentalities after win Read more\n\nSwansea’s frailties were brutally exposed as United played with the belief and freedom that has been so badly missing of late. Michael Carrick, who was making his first Premier League start of the season, was excellent in the midfield holding role, Wayne Rooney thrived on the left and Ibrahimovic looked as if he was enjoying playing football again.\n\nIt was, in short, just what United needed after that chastening defeat against Fenerbahce in the Europa League on Thursday night and all the more satisfying for Mourinho given that he was forced to name such a makeshift defence. Phil Jones made his first appearance since January, Ashley Young was deployed at right-back, Marcos Rojo featured as an auxiliary centre-half and Matteo Darmian played out of position on the left. That the four of them barely broke sweat when it came to their defensive duties in the first half says everything about Swansea’s inept and listless performance.\n\nSecond from bottom in the Premier League and having picked up only two points from a possible 30 since their victory at Burnley on the opening day, Swansea are sleepwalking towards the Championship. The lack of commitment in the first half, when United had so much space and time on the ball, was arguably more worrying than the shortage of quality. Bob Bradley, who has picked up only one point from his first four games in charge, admitted he was angry.\n\nThe fans felt the same way, although their fury was directed more at the directors’ box than the players. “We want our club back” and “You greedy bastards, get out of our club” sang a section of supporters during the first half, with the board members who made millions out of the summer takeover the target of their ire. Huw Jenkins, the club’s chairman and a man who could do no wrong at one time, was also singled out for abuse on a day when Swansea were booed off at half-time and full-time.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Swansea manager, Bob Bradley, heard his side booed as fans aired discontent at the club’s board. Photograph: Athena Pictures/Getty Images\n\n“There’s only one way for us to win the support of the fans and that is to play better and take points,” Bradley said. “I know there’s some back and forth going on but from our side, the players and coaches, professionally we’ve got to focus on the only part we control, and that’s how we compete and fight for points. The fans were angry with us at half-time and I understand. The first half we did not do enough to win them over in any way and, with a 3-0 scoreline at half-time at home, they have every right to be angry at that point, and we have to be honest about the work that needs to be done.”\n\nUnited’s first-half blitz started after 14 minutes and it was a quite brilliant goal that got them on their way. Mike van der Hoorn’s headed clearance was poor but Pogba, loitering about 22 yards from goal, showed wonderful technique to get over the top of a bouncing ball and send it arrowing into the top corner with his right boot.\n\nSwansea’s Modou Barrow: ‘People living near me in Gambia die on that route’ Read more\n\nSwansea looked shellshocked, United were moving the ball around with ease and it was no surprise when the visitors added a second. After a long period of United possession Rooney laid the ball back and Ibrahimovic, in an abundance of space, sidestepped Ki Sung-yueng’s half-hearted attempt to close him down before drilling a low shot from just outside the area that Lukasz Fabianski should have saved. Instead the ball slipped inside the Swansea goalkeeper’s near post and Ibrahimovic celebrated ending a run of 609 minutes without scoring in the Premier League.\n\nThe Swede soon had his second and United’s third. Linking well with Rooney in the centre of the pitch after neatly controlling David de Gea’s long ball upfield, Ibrahimovic traded passes with the United captain, shrugged off Àngel Rangel and lifted the ball beyond Fabianski. It was to all intents game over with almost an hour remaining.\n\nVan der Hoorn reduced the deficit in the second half when he headed in Gylfi Sigurdsson’s free-kick and Modou Barrow was later denied by De Gea but there was never any prospect of a Swansea comeback and Juan Mata, expertly set up by Rooney, could easily have added a fourth."}, {"date": "06/11/2016", "arena": "The King Power

Champions League for a sensation this season. West Bromwich Albion deservedly became the first visiting team in more than a year to leave the King Power with three Premier League points and, in doing so, they left Leicester just two above the bottom three. It is premature to talk about the champions being embroiled in a fight against relegation but we can certainly say that the chances of them retaining their domestic crown are so remote as to be extra-terrestrial.\n\nLast season Leicester conquered thanks to their efficiency, as they were a unit in which every component gelled and excelled to create synergy. But they have spluttered for much of this campaign because of the loss of N’Golo Kanté and, in the league at least, of whatever mental fuel it was that helped drive them to the title.\n\nIn the last fortnight they had shown signs of rediscovering their fluency but here they relapsed into disjointedness. Albion functioned better from the start and won thanks to a neat clip by Matt Phillips in the 72nd minute after an uncharacteristic mistake from Danny Drinkwater.\n\n“I’m sorry for the loss of our home record,” said Claudio Ranieri. “We were so bad in the first half, we were better in the second but we still lost,” he continued before venturing, without conviction, that his team may have been jaded from their midweek draw in Copenhagen. “Maybe we had Champions League fatigue, I don’t know.”\n\nLeicester 1-2 West Brom: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nLeicester’s scruffiness surfaced as early in the second minute, when Andy King was caught dawdling midway inside his own half by Salomón Rondón, who burst into the box and curled a low shot towards the bottom corner. Ron-Robert Zieler dived to tip it around the post. It was a terrific save but the goalkeeper’s all-round performance in place of the injured Kasper Schmeichel betrayed his unfamiliarity with his team-mates, the German’s hesitant distribution one of the hosts’ many problems. Twice he came close to being caught in possession by Rondón, the game’s outstanding forward.\n\nRondón met a cross by Phillips in the 15th minute. His header missed the target but the fact that he was dominating Wes Morgan and Robert Huth in the air, as well as on the ground, was ominous for Leicester. The hosts, meanwhile, rarely troubled the Albion defence. Ranieri had opted to leave Jamie Vardy on the bench. The England striker’s scoring touch has deserted him, as he came into this game without a goal in his last 11 matches for his club, and the manager explained that the plan here was for Leicester’s wingers to play to the strengths of Islam Slimani and Shinji Okazaki instead by providing crosses from wide. But Riyad Mahrez failed to make an impact in the first period and Ahmed Musa’s deliveries were bad enough to suggest that if he were your milkman, you would find broken bottles on your door step every morning.\n\nPhillips’ crosses were better. In the 17th minute he forced Christian Fuchs into an urgent intervention to prevent Chris Brunt from scoring from close range. Ranieri replaced Okazaki with Vardy at half-time and Leicester improved, although those two facts were not necessarily related, as Vardy seldom threatened. And before improving, Leicester fell behind. Rondón was instrumental in the breakthrough, winning the ball in midfield before feeding Phillips, whose cross from the right was guided into the net by a header from James Morrison.\n\nLiverpool’s Sadio Mané shows Watford no mercy to put Jürgen Klopp top Read more\n\nThat triggered a reaction from Leicester. They drew level three minutes later via a long-distance Algerian one-two. Slimani swept the ball wide to Mahrez and then galumphed into the box to get on the end of his compatriot’s cross and equalise with a splendid header.\n\nNow we had a high-calibre contest and the game hurtled from one end to the other. Danny Simpson had to bundle a header off his own line in the 70th minute. But eventually Leicester were undone by another outbreak of sloppiness as Drinkwater unintentionally played a backpass into the path of Phillips, who cantered on to it and lifted the ball over the advancing Zieler. It was a deflating moment for a midfielder who contributed so much to Leicester’s title triumph and perhaps a critical one for Phillips.\n\n“His biggest problem is self-belief,” said Tony Pulis. “I had a good chat with him last week. He’s got all the tools and he has to understand that he’s a good player.” If doubts ever stalk him again, the Scottish international need only look back to this performance."}, {"date": "05/11/2016", "arena": "Vitality Stadium", "attendance": 11084, "home_team": {"name": "Bournemouth", "lineup": [{"name": "Artur Boruc", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Smith", "yellows": [73], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Simon Francis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steve Cook", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charlie Daniels", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dan Gosling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [11], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Arter", "yellows": [3], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [76]}, {"name": "Junior Stanislas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [82]}, {"name": "Jack Wilshere", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordon Ibe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Joshua King", "yellows": [30], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Nathan Aké", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marc Pugh", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Benik Afobe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Federici", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Fraser", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [82], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tyrone Mings", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lys Mousset", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [76], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Sunderland", "lineup": [{"name": "Jordan Pickford", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Billy Jones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lamine Koné", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Papy Djilobodji", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Patrick van Aanholt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Duncan Watmore", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Steven Pienaar", "yellows": [43], "reds": [59], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Didier Ndong", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paddy McNair", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [72]}, {"name": "Victor Anichebe", "yellows": [70], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [33], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jermain Defoe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [74], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}], "subs": [{"name": "Jason Denayer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [72], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wahbi Khazri", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Mika", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Javi Manquillo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Donald Love", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adnan Januzaj", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lynden Gooch", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "For Sunderland, the interminable wait is over. At the 11th time of asking, the bottom-placed team have their first win of the season. David Moyes’s side were second best in every facet of the game apart from the scoreline, yet they displayed an impressive combination of spirit and fight to not only come from behind but do so with 10 men, in turn boosting their hopes of clambering out of the bottom three.\n\nDan Gosling had put Bournemouth in front, but the hosts’ inability to finish a hatful of good chances proved costly. Victor Anichebe, making his first start for Sunderland, scored the equaliser and despite being penned back after Steven Pienaar was shown a second yellow card an hour in, Jermain Defoe’s penalty, won by Anichebe, ensured that Moyes, who was serving a touchline ban for swearing at an official during the EFL Cup defeat to Southampton 10 days ago, will enter the international break no longer worrying whether his position is tenable.\n\n“Sometimes you need a bit of good fortune on your side,” he said, but they also helped to create their own luck. Sunderland conceded 70% of the ball and faced 22 shots, but they were not just hungry and determined throughout – the Black Cats also displayed ruthlessness in front of goal.\n\nAt the same time, a fine Jordan Pickford performance combined with Bournemouth’s profligacy kept them in the game, and Moyes said his team looked haggard and were overrun during the spell immediately following Pienaar’s dismissal. Indeed, by that juncture Bournemouth could already have been out of sight.\n\nBournemouth 1-2 Sunderland, FA Cup first round and more: clockwatch – as it happened Read more\n\nGosling’s finish for the 11th-minute opener may have been unconventional but everything about the buildup play was typical of Eddie Howe’s team. Junior Stanislas spotted the run of Adam Smith to his right and sent a lovely through-ball from near the penalty arc. The defender timed his run perfectly and squared to Gosling, who bundled the ball home with his belly from about four yards.\n\nA quickfire second seemed on the cards when Stanislas found the side netting after some strong hold-up play from Joshua King, while he almost had an assist when returning the favour to King in the 27th minute. Pickford did well to palm away the striker’s powerful drive.\n\nIn contrast Sunderland seldom found an opportunity to attack but Moyes’s decision to play with two up front paid off when Anichebe was fed by Defoe 12 minutes before half-time. With his back to goal, the target man fended off Simon Francis’s challenge before turning and sending a ferocious shot high into Artur Boruc’s net. “Victor’s got a lot going for him,” Moyes said. “He doesn’t always show it but he did today, that’s for sure.”\n\nIt was the visitors’ first notable chance but they were undoubtedly buoyed by regaining parity. Duncan Watmore found the net just before the interval only to be ruled offside upon meeting Billy Jones’s cross.\n\nBoruc was forced to palm away a Didier N’Dong shot after 55 minutes but Sunderland’s belief was tempered by Pienaar’s sending off a couple of minutes later. Booked late in the first half for a tackle on Jack Wilshere, the midfielder was shown a second yellow for planting his studs on the right shin of Stanislas.\n\nBournemouth almost made the advantage count immediately when Stanislas hit a post. A slew of opportunities followed in the proceeding minutes. Gosling had a goalward effort deflected for a corner, Harry Arter headed wide and Wilshere failed to hit the target from eight yards.\n\nThe on-loan Arsenal midfielder is expected to be in Gareth Southgate’s England squad, which will be announced on Sunday, though Howe was unwilling to comment. “It’s difficult until I know for sure,” the Bournemouth manager said. “Jack did well today. He was hugely influential behind a lot of our good moments.”\n\nSunderland’s lack of attacking intent in the immediate period following the sending-off could be summed up by Defoe becoming an auxiliary right-back. But Jason Denayer’s introduction for Paddy McNair allowed the visiting captain the chance to reassume an attacking role and he started the move that led to the penalty by nutmegging Charlie Daniels near the touchline. From there he picked out Watmore who, in turn, passed to Anichebe. The striker took a heavy touch in the area but was then hauled down by a sliding Smith. Mike Dean had no hesitation in pointing to the spot and Defoe was as cool as ever.\n\nBenik Afobe and Steve Cook both missed the target, while Pickford produced another for his show reel when turning a stinging King shot over his bar as Bournemouth tried to draw level.\n\n“It’s unlike us,” Howe said. “We created a hatful of chances but we couldn’t put them away. It was a frustrating afternoon.”\n\nHowever, Sunderland nervously played out five minutes of injury-time before erupting in celebration."}, {"date": "05/11/2016", "arena": "Turf Moor", "attendance": 19196, "home_team": {"name": "Burnley", "lineup": [{"name": "Tom Heaton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matthew Lowton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Keane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Mee", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jon Flanagan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Johann Berg Gudmundsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [14], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dean Marney", "yellows": [10], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Defour", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [74]}, {"name": "Scott Arfield", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [65]}, {"name": "Jeff Hendrick", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [86]}, {"name": "Sam Vokes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [2], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Andre Gray", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Barnes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [90], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [86], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Kightly", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Patrick Bamford", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paul Robinson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "George Boyd", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [65], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Tarkowski", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [74], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Crystal Palace", "lineup": [{"name": "Steve Mandanda", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joel Ward", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Scott Dann", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Damien Delaney", "yellows": [78], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Kelly", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [59]}, {"name": "James McArthur", "yellows": [59], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [88]}, {"name": "Yohan Cabaye", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andros Townsend", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jason Puncheon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [59]}, {"name": "Wilfried Zaha", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Benteke", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [81], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Mathieu Flamini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Tomkins", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wayne Hennessey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chung-Yong Lee", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Ledley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [88], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Zeki Fryers", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [59], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Connor Wickham", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [60], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [59], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "The last time Burnley were in the Premier League it took them 10 games to record their first win.

It was almost ridiculous they needed the most dramatic of stoppage-time winners after allowing Palace back into the game from two goals down, though substitute Ashley Barnes saving the best until last certainly sent the crowd home happy.\n\n“That was a proper ding-dong,” Sean Dyche, the Burnley manager, said. “You can’t really enjoy games when you are involved in trying to win them, but that must have been a terrific match for anyone to watch. The quality of the last goal alone was tremendous, and you have to be impressed with that sort of will and desire in the 94th minute.”\n\nHis Palace counterpart, Alan Pardew, was in a way. “It is galling to come away with a defeat in those circumstances, we would have been quite happy with a point,” he said. “We played OK, but they broke on us twice.

Caught with too many men in forward positions as Burnley cleared an early corner, Jeff Hendrick was initially prevented from releasing Johann Berg Gudmundsson into space on the left but Steven Defour arrived in time to continue the move via Matthew Lowton. Gudmundsson’s eventual cross from the left was met by Lowton in the middle and though Scott Dann managed to block the shot the ball ran loose for Sam Vokes to tap home.\n\nJason Puncheon and Wilfried Zaha managed to bring the now expected saves from Tom Heaton in the Burnley goal as Palace tried to find a way back, before neat work in the centre circle by Vokes sent Gudmundsson racing clear. The winger shot early and true and Steve Mandanda did well to get down to it, but when Gudmundsson hits a ball with his left foot it stays hit. The Palace keeper could not hold the shot and could only watch as the ball looped up in the air behind him to spin over the line.\n\nVokes had two or three chances to make the game safe at the start of the second half and it appeared those misses might prove expensive when Palace pulled a goal back on the hour. Connor Wickham had only just come on to replace Puncheon when Zaha found him with a low cross from the right. Managing to stay onside by a fraction, the substitute produced a crisp finish to score with his first touch.\n\nSuddenly, Zaha was everywhere, switching wings and causing Burnley problems every time he got the ball, though it was a determined run down the left from the otherwise quiet Andros Townsend that led to Palace’s equaliser. This time it was Burnley who were guilty of sending too many men up for a corner. Palace exploited the space with a quick break and Lowton was still attempting to get back into position when he stuck out a hand to divert Townsend’s cross, Christian Benteke converting the penalty.\n\nBurnley were not about to settle for a point though. Dyche sent his final substitute on for the last five minutes, and in added time Barnes broke with the impressive Gudmundsson keeping pace on his right. Barnes played the ball wide then moved up to accept a perfect cross with an equally unimprovable finish.\n\nAlmost unbelievably, there was still time for Townsend to hit a post at the other end, but Burnley held on. Palace did play well, as Pardew said, but must now spend the international break worrying about the prospect of their luck changing against Manchester City."}, {"date": "05/11/2016", "arena": "Etihad

beating Barcelona when they conceded a late Marten de Roon equaliser that left Pep Guardiola disgusted in the technical area.\n\nThe Dutch midfielder’s added-time header came as City scintillated before the break and seriously ran out of gas after it. Sergio Agüero’s 43rd-minute finish – a 150th goal in 223 appearances for the club – appeared to be the winner until Adama Traoré was left free to run across almost the whole field from the right, George Friend was allowed to float the ball in and De Roon beat City’s jumpers to finish past Claudio Bravo.\n\nJermain Defoe spot-on at Bournemouth to give Sunderland first win Read more\n\nWhen Kevin Friend blew for time moments later the referee’s whistle was accompanied by boos – perhaps to tell Guardiola that when any opposition is not killed off a smash-and-grab can occur.\n\nThis meant City have drawn their last three home league games, having also shared the points with Southampton and Everton. A frustrated Guardiola said: “Do you think it is a problem when the opponent arrives two times a game and we arrive 10 times? In all three games we are much better than the opponent. Now we talk and analyse, is it a problem in the box [not finishing and conceding]. If we end 1-0, we talk about the performance and how good it was.\n\n“The second half we didn’t play like the first one but I think they have one chance in the beginning of the second half and the last minute. Everton and Southampton as well, when you see all three games, we drop six points, they arrive maybe four or five times in our box. We create enough chances, we attack really well and control the counterattacks and we create enough chances, more than enough to win the game and when you arrive in the last minutes, just 1-0, everything can happen.”\n\nThe Catalan’s message beforehand was clear: use the superb midweek win over Barça as motivation to be as focused and ruthless again. Overall he could be pleased by a first half-hour of domination but anxious his team had not capitalised.\n\nFrom the side that downed Barcelona, Guardiola made three changes. Out went Willy Caballero, Nicolás Otamendi, and Raheem Sterling and in came Bravo (who had been suspended), Aleksandar Kolarov and Jesús Navas. Otamendi and Sterling were rested. Of particular interest was how Kolarov, a left-back by trade, beat Vincent Kompany to a centre-back berth, the captain having to settle for a replacement role.\n\nFootball transfer rumours: Sergio Agüero to leave City for Real Madrid? Read more\n\nAgüero continues to be in a challenge to convince Guardiola of his enduring worth and all he can do is keep on scoring and contributing as he did again here on Saturday.\n\nDuring City’s first-half onslaught Guardiola bent to his knees in anguish as David Silva blazed at Víctor Valdés and the Spaniard’s reflexes impressed as they had previously. The former Manchester United and Barcelona goalkeeper was having a fine game but, when recovering from a bad gash caused by a Navas challenge, Valdés could do nothing about City’s superb opener.\n\nKevin De Bruyne is having the season of his life under Guardiola. So, too, is Agüero. They combined for a simply sublime strike, as the Belgian fashioned another bending pass that left the red shirts before him bystanders, and there was the Argentinian to stab home.\n\nAt the break Middlesbrough will have been relieved to wander off only 1-0 behind. Now, though, they turned the game, and Aitor Karanka explained how. “We went to the pitch and showed them too much respect,” the manager said. “At half-time I told them we had to play.”\n\nHis order was carried out admirably. First, Álvaro Negredo, once of this parish, came close to lobbing Bravo as the goalkeeper back-pedalled to tip over.\n\nBarnes breaks Palace hearts with late Burnley winner to deny fightback Read more\n\nAfter Stewart Downing flashed an effort past the wrong side of the left post, Guardiola made a move. This, unsurprisingly, was positive, as he replaced Ilkay Gündogan, a midfielder, with Nolito, a forward.\n\nAs the game ended Agüero could rue skying over from close range, as now came De Roon’s moment. The Argentinean echoed his manager’s words. “It was a strange match because we controlled the game but I have a bad feeling because we conceded,” he said. “The Premier League is a complicated competition where anyone can beat you. That showed today.”\n\nOf his late miss, Agüero said: “I had many chances today, the clearest was the one where Jesús Navas pulled the ball back to me. It was under my feet and I only had a few seconds to decide.

The latest problem? The pitch is too slow.\n\nAfter crowd violence and trouble with segregation, stewarding and fans who refuse to sit down, the Hammers were able to enjoy a relatively calm afternoon off the pitch on Saturday. Extra stewards and police in the ground for the first time maintained a controlled atmosphere.\n\nBut both managers were in agreement that a slow surface helped to disrupt the action on the field, contributing to what in the end was a tepid Premier League draw.\n\nA second-half own goal from Glenn Whelan and a smart equaliser from the substitute Bojan Krkic meant a point apiece for both sides before the international break. The result, however, will better serve Mark Hughes’s resurgent Stoke, now unbeaten in six league games, than Slaven Bilic’s Hammers, who sit in 16th place in the division and now face a torrid run of fixtures.\n\n“We’re on a good run at the moment”, said Hughes. “Our confidence was high coming into the match and I wanted to see that carried into our performance, which I did. We were clear in our own minds as to what the atmosphere would be like here and I think the fans enjoyed the experience.\n\nJermain Defoe spot-on at Bournemouth to give Sunderland first win Read more\n\n“One thing I would say, though, is that maybe the pitch is a bit slow. Whether that’s through design I don’t know, but it didn’t help us with the way we want to play. It’s difficult to get the ball down and pass and play at a high tempo. I feel that’s probably the same problem for West Ham.”\n\nBilic, whose next four opponents are Spurs, Manchester United, Liverpool and Arsenal, concurred with his rival. “The pitch was a little bit slow but that shouldn’t have stopped us playing,” he said. “We were slow in the first half. We simply took too many touches, we were flat, we weren’t winning second balls.\n\n“In the second half we changed after 60 minutes, we put a couple of strikers up and they give us energy. Our best part of the game was between the goals. When we scored we knew they were going to put bodies up, but that we would get space. Then we gave away a very cheap goal and, at the end, you have to say it was a fair result.”\n\nMost neutral observers would agree with Bilic’s assessment. His unfamiliar-looking West Ham side, with Cheikhou Kouyaté playing at right-back and left-back Aaron Cresswell almost operating at left-wing, struggled to string passes together. They faced a typically redoubtable Stoke side for whom Joe Allen was once again outstanding in his unique defensive No10 role.\n\nManchester City stumble as Marten de Roon grabs Middlesbrough a point Read more\n\nDimitri Payet and Manuel Lanzini were once again subdued, although the Frenchman had the first half’s best chance when presented with a free-kick in his preferred area, only to curl it a good yard over the bar.\n\nThe playmaker Lanzini was withdrawn on the hour, alongside André Ayew, making his first league appearance since August, and the energy of the replacements Ashley Fletcher and Edimilson Fernandes immediately penned Stoke back.\n\nThe Hammers won a corner and played the ball short to Payet on the edge of the box. He jinked to his right to cross and find the dependable forehead of Michail Antonio. The England international’s header came off Whelan to deceive goalkeeper Lee Grant. It was adjudged an own goal and denied Antonio his sixth headed strike of the season.\n\nHughes responded to the goal with his own double substitution, also changing his shape to 4-4-2. Krkic has been the player to suffer for Allen’s good form, but with the Welshman withdrawn to the middle of the park the Spaniard returned to the field and scored within five minutes. Charlie Adam’s clever long pass caught the West Ham defence flat-footed as Jonathan Walters bore down on the ball. Adrián made the fateful decision to come off his line and his foul on Walters would have been a penalty had Krkic not already turned the Irish forward’s looped cross into the net.\n\nThe final 10 minutes were more energetic than any that had preceded it and Adam might have won it for the visitors with a long-range shot that Adrián did well to save."}, {"date": "05/11/2016", "arena": "Stamford

John Terry enjoyed a suitably warm reception from the locals as he ran on and the club captain’s reduced role was a reminder that Chelsea are quickly building a new identity under the manager who has breathed fresh life into a side that improbably flirted with a relegation battle a year ago.\n\nThey never quite got over José Mourinho when his first spell in charge came to a bitter end nine years ago.

While Ronald Koeman was critical of Everton’s failure to match their opponents’ aggression in those crucial early stages when the game slipped from their grasp, he spoke admiringly of the winning mentality that Chelsea are developing under Conte.\n\nNothing epitomises their resurgence more than the way that Diego Costa and Eden Hazard have rediscovered their zip and poise after drifting aimlessly through last season. Costa took revenge for a dangerous early tackle from Séamus Coleman that left him with a bloody right ankle and an even bigger scowl than usual by pulverising Everton’s ragged defence, while Hazard had a hand in all five of Chelsea’s goals and scored twice, taking his tally to seven from his first 11 league matches.\n\nConte insisted that it is not important that Chelsea’s victory lifted them to the Premier League’s summit, pointing out that Arsenal and Liverpool have opportunities to overtake them on Sunday. Yet any side that puts together a run of five consecutive wins and clean sheets should not be underestimated. “Fantastica,” Conte said when he was asked to sum up Chelsea’s performance with an Italian word.\n\nChelsea have certainly come a long way since their thrashing by Arsenal at the end of September, when the talk was of crisis and a side that would struggle to qualify for the Champions League. Conte had seen enough after that humiliation in north London, switching to a 3-4-3 system, and it has not taken long for Chelsea to feel the benefits of the Italian’s proactive repair job.\n\n“I have never seen a team so strong playing this system,” Koeman said. “The movements of Hazard and Costa, it is difficult.”\n\nEverton’s manager flattered Conte with an imitation of his system, Phil Jagielka’s return to the side allowing the visitors to line up with three centre-backs, but his ploy had no effect. Nine minutes before half-time, Koeman ditched Plan A and brought on Kevin Mirallas for Bryan Oviedo. Six minutes later, Costa scored Chelsea’s third, finishing confidently after Nemanja Matic flicked on Hazard’s corner.\n\nChelsea have made a habit of blowing their opponents away with blistering starts in recent weeks and they took control of the game inside the first 20 minutes thanks to two moments of brilliance from Hazard. Everton had started with intent, the fireworks that lit up the darkening sky in west London before kick-off matched by the sparks that flew on the pitch when Coleman’s studs raked Costa’s right ankle. Blood seeped through Costa’s sock and the Everton defender somehow got away with it, although he might have preferred an early bath given how the match unfolded.\n\nThe punishment began in the 19th minute. Missing the calming touches of the suspended Idrissa Gueye, Everton’s midfield was overwhelmed by Matic and N’Golo Kanté. Gareth Barry lost possession in the middle, Hazard broke down the left, beat Ashley Williams and aimed for the far corner, the unsighted Maarten Stekelenburg allowing the Belgian’s crisp drive to beat his dive.\n\nThere was barely time for Everton to gather their thoughts before Hazard was bursting clear again. Pedro rolled the ball across the area for Marcos Alonso, who slipped a low finish through Stekelenburg’s legs for his first Chelsea goal. “If they get the space, they will kill that,” Koeman said.\n\nA win would have lifted Everton into fifth place but they never troubled Thibaut Courtois. Romelu Lukaku fed off scraps against his former club and the Everton forward could only watch as Hazard ran riot at the other end, a slick exchange with Pedro creating the space for him to dart inside from the right and fire inside the near post.\n\n“He is playing great football,” Conte said. “The most important thing is Eden is fantastic with the ball and without the ball.”\n\nChelsea refused to stop. Costa instigated another attack, turning superbly before finding Hazard. Stekelenburg saved his curling effort this time but Pedro scored on the rebound from close range.\n\nCelebrating wildly, Conte did not realise that the fans were singing his name until one of his assistants told him. He looked at the crowd, beamed and clenched his fist."}, {"date": "31/10/2016", "arena": "Bet365 Stadium", "attendance": 26602, "home_team": {"name": "Stoke City", "lineup": [{"name": "Lee Grant",

"report": "Never mind a wet midweek test at Stoke City, this was a Halloween which ended with Swansea City given the lasting fright of a defeat that leaves them second bottom and five points from safety.\n\nFor Stoke a third consecutive win lifts them to 12th position and suddenly they are looking up following a barren beginning. They made it nine points from nine thanks to a second-half own-goal from Alfie Mawson and Wilfried Bony’s second of the match.\n\nCan Liverpool's fearsome forwards sustain a title challenge? – Football Weekly Read more\n\nA pleased Mark Hughes was annoyed only at the yellow card Michael Oliver, the referee, gave Marko Arnautovic: “It’s the one frustration – he acknowledged that maybe he made a mistake [after the game]. But it doesn’t help us as it’s five yellows so Marko misses a game.\n\n“Our attacking play was really good. Any number of chances could have gone in but we got the job done. It was great to get a third straight win, enabling us to get into a position where we feel more comfortable. We do not feel like a team that belongs in the bottom half. It was important to win and get into that middle group and we now have the same amount of points we had at this stage last season.”\n\nThe Swansea manager, Bob Bradley, was, to his credit, honest following a third match in charge without a victory. “It’s a huge job, I knew that from the start,” he said. “When there’s a change it’s because things haven’t gone well. You come in, look at fixtures lying ahead and it’s not like you do it with guarantees of points. You win games with some combination of your football and mentality. I don’t think we were good enough in either category.”\n\nHughes’s men took the lead after three minutes as Bony finally opened his account for Stoke in an eighth appearance. In fact, it was his first goal for anyone since Boxing Day. A Xherdan Shaqiri corner found Joe Allen, the playmaker miscued and, when the ball came to Bony, he stabbed home to score against his former club.\n\nBefore kick-off Bradley had offered light-hearted comments about players’ musical taste – none has heard Bruce Springsteen or U2, apparently – but there was nothing amusing for him in the awful defending that led to the opening goal. Within five minutes he could smile again, though. This time Phil Bardsley was the culprit. Despite seeming to try to throw the smaller Wayne Routledge to the ground, the right-back was unable to stop him heading past Lee Grant after Gylfi Sigurdsson’s clever piece of skill had created the opening for an expert cross.\n\nBony came close to adding his and Stoke’s second moments later with a shot that required a Taylor deflection to go wide. After a lull in play Charlie Adam clipped Lukasz Fabianski’s left post. Later there was a slick move that went from Taylor to Llorente to Sigurdsson, though the Icelander’s effort went for a corner that came to nothing.\n\nThe quality then dipped. Passes went astray, punts were hoofed away and there were gaps in each team’s shape. Adam again hit the upright – this time the right one – with another fine curling effort but when an Arnautovic cross-shot went miles wide it summed up how the first half was going until a superb moment from Allen. Collecting the ball inside Swansea’s half, the 26-year-old let go a slide rule pass that pierced the visiting rearguard and played in Arnautovic. The Austrian rounded Fabianski yet once again Stoke were denied by a post. As the interval approached another neat Llorente lay-off found Routledge and the 31-year-old stung Grant’s fingers.\n\nStoke v Swansea: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nGiven the space each team had enjoyed the half-time messages from Hughes and Bradley may have been similar: tighten up and keep hunting and chances should come. If so, the Welshman will have been heartened when Bony received a clear view of Fabianski’s goal and the American relieved when the Ivorian ultimately blazed over.\n\nStoke provided a mirror image of their start to the opening half. They peppered Swansea and finally took the lead again. Ramadan Sobhi, a 19-year-old Egyptian who replaced Shaqiri – who had a tight hamstring – on 26 minutes, danced along the left then banged the ball across goal and it went in off the unfortunate Mawson.\n\nThat came 10 minutes into the second period and it prompted Bradley to make a move soon afterwards when he took off the ineffective Modou Barrow for Bastón. The 24-year-old took up Barrow’s berth along his side’s left. It was from the opposite flank, though, that Routledge, who along with Sigurdsson was Swansea’s best performer, gave Stoke a scare. The winger ducked and dived, then skated into the area before he was finally halted by the home defence.\n\nThen came the grandstand finish from Stoke as Bony’s headed finish from Allen’s improvised cross made this a happy closing day of October for them."}, {"date": "30/10/2016", "arena": "Goodison Park", "attendance": 39574, "home_team": {"name": "Everton", "lineup": [{"name": "Joel",

their development under Ronald Koeman. A 2-0 lead against West Ham United was the cue for Everton to implode at Goodison Park last season. Only Slaven Bilic’s defence collapsed this time out.\n\nEverton found relief not only in a first win in six matches but in the contribution of Barkley, who was involved in the breakthrough, started and finished the move that sealed victory and was denied another only by a superb save from Adrián. It was a timely response to criticism of his end product and talk of Wayne Rooney returning to Goodison, both emanating from Koeman himself.\n\nChelsea’s Eden Hazard and Diego Costa turn on style to sink Southampton Read more\n\n“It was one of his best games of this season,” the Everton manager said. “He was working hard, he was tackling offensively, he was important in the game and Adrián made an incredible save in the first half and then he scored the second goal. He was really the player behind the defence and the front to create.”\n\nGoodison also witnessed the contrast between Koeman and his Everton predecessor as West Ham paid a substantial price for defensive lapses and repeated failures in front of goal. With seven minutes remaining Koeman replaced a winger, the influential Yannick Bolasie, with the defender Phil Jagielka to close out an entertaining contest.\n\nLast season Roberto Martínez replaced a winger, Aaron Lennon, with the striker Oumar Niasse in the 76th minute with Everton leading 2-0. West Ham responded with three goals and Martínez’s relationship with the Goodison crowd never recovered. There would be no repeat as Everton, marking the one-year anniversary of Howard Kendall’s death, rediscovered their cutting edge and the way to win.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Romelu Lukaku celebrates scoring with Kevin Mirallas. Photograph: Carl Recine/Reuters\n\nIt proved a torturous afternoon for Bilic. West Ham started with the confidence befitting a team with three straight victories and improved attacking options but their threat and concentration deteriorated after the interval as Everton delivered a lesson in ruthlessness. Lukaku opened the scoring with his ninth goal in 11 appearances against the Hammers and, with the hosts sharp on the counterattack, the visitors’ pursuit of an equaliser left them exposed.\n\n“Harsh? No,” was the verdict of the West Ham manager. “They were more lethal or more mature or more cruel. When they were offered something, they took it straightaway which we didn’t do when we created or they made mistakes. There is a bitter side because we should take something out of this game. I had a feeling before the game and at half-time there was something for us. We played some good football, created some chances and I felt they were really vulnerable at the back, especially at the beginning of the game, but then we gave a goal away. But not harsh, I can’t blame anyone other than us. It is not the referee or bad luck. It was all 50-50. We just didn’t take it.”\n\nPedro Obiang squandered a glorious chance created by Dimitri Payet early on and the latter as well as Michail Antonio and Manuel Lanzini had sight of Everton’s goal in the first half but were unable to convert. Joel Robles, deputising for the injured Maarten Stekelenburg, also deserves credit for his clean sheet having saved well from Antonio and the captain, Mark Noble.\n\nEverton opened nervously but improved as the game wore on. Barkley thought he had opened the scoring when he collected Bryan Oviedo’s cut-back on the left, stepped inside Winston Reid and shot powerfully from 12 yards. The ball took a deflection en route yet Adrián somehow read the flight to tip over with a superb reflex save. Reid had controlled Lukaku impressively in the first half but their role reversal was instrumental in deciding the outcome in the second.\n\nThe Belgium international converted his inevitable goal against West Ham due to a series of defensive errors coupled with quick-thinking by Bolasie. Reid put his team under pressure with a weak clearance that enabled Barkley to set up Seamus Coleman for a low drive that Adrián parried to his left. Reid and Aaron Cresswell each left the loose ball to the other and Bolasie seized on the indecision to slide in and clip the ball back across goal.

This was arguably a more impressively constructed victory than that handed to them so obligingly by Manchester United the previous Sunday, a win chiselled out against one of the form teams in the division and a side who had not lost here since February. Southampton ended up feeling forlorn. Given the hosts’ underlying qualities to win this comfortably was remarkable.\n\nChelsea, then under Guus Hiddink’s interim stewardship, had been the last team to prevail at Southampton’s expense on the south coast, but that had been a success squeezed late and improbably from an even contest. This, in contrast, was a masterclass in how to exert almost complete control despite the home side hogging the ball for the majority of the play. Conte’s side, so expertly drilled, kept their opponents at arm’s length throughout. Their celebrations in front of the away support at the end, with the manager barely able to contain his delight, reinforced the impression the collective is suddenly strong.\n\nAntonio Conte cautious on title chances after Chelsea extend winning run Read more\n\nThis was a show of new-found strength. So much has been made of the Italian’s three-man defensive block – a system adopted out of desperation back when Chelsea had been exposed too often as vulnerable – but they seamlessly morphed into a five when required, with wing-backs working feverishly at both ends of the pitch and a midfield crammed with energy and industry. They have adapted superbly to the change in formation and have not been breached in 410 minutes of Premier League football, all but five of which have been with a trio of centre-halves blunting their opponents’ intent.\n\nA team that had appeared so fragile against the fluid movement offered up by Liverpool and Arsenal in recent weeks have unearthed steel. Picking passage through these resolute massed banks of blue must feel an onerous task. It was one utterly beyond Southampton.\n\nThibaut Courtois made one save of relative note, from a Dusan Tadic free-kick, and watched Charlie Austin head over the bar and have another effort ruled out for offside, but a team who had been on the charge up the table over recent weeks would have expected to inflict more damage than that. Claude Puel cited fatigue as a contributory factor, but figuratively thumping your head against a brick wall for 90 minutes can presumably have that effect. “It is so difficult to play against,” added the Frenchman through a sigh.\n\nStubborn, well-marshalled defence alone would not have been enough to prevail here, but Chelsea boast sufficient spark in forward areas to capitalise on such solidity. Those wing-backs, and particularly the revived Victor Moses down the right, offer pace and width while the trickery of Eden Hazard and Pedro combines thrillingly with Diego Costa’s brute strength.\n\nThe goal the Spain international curled so gloriously beyond an exposed Fraser Forster from just outside the penalty area 10 minutes into the second half, as Cuco Martina limply hung out a leg in a half-hearted attempt to block, was his eighth this season and 40th in only 64 top-flight outings, a record all the more staggering given his own rather fitful contribution through last season’s toils.\n\nCosta may not always see eye-to-eye with a manager every bit as intense on the touchline as the striker is out on the turf, but a player whose temperament has so often left him open to sanction has led the line through four league wins without accruing the fifth yellow card of term that will see him serve a ban. The 28-year-old has effectively played on the edge of suspension for well over a month, retaining his snarl but ensuring his infamously physical and inflammatory approach has not crossed the line. At some point the yellow will come Costa’s way but, at present, it is more appropriate to acknowledge the goalscoring contribution he is making to the team.\n\nThen there is Hazard. It had been the Belgian who eased the visitors aheadat St Mary’s, a cleverly delivered move upfield culminating in Moses slipping a return pass round Ryan Bertrand for the winger, evading Steve Davis, to collect. He took his time to tease out Davis’ sliding tackle before cutting inside and ripping a low shot through Forster’s legs at his near post.\n\nRomelu Lukaku and Ross Barkley get Everton back on track against West Ham Read more\n\nIt was the third successive game in which Hazard had scored, swelling his season’s tally to five. He has managed more goals in 10 games this season than he mustered in all 31 last time round and feels less of an indulgence when he contributes like this. “He has come back to a good level after last season’s difficulties,” said Puel, who had handed Hazard his first-team debut while at Lille. The 25-year-old was a constant threat here, as he has been all season, and was denied further reward only by Forster’s excellence and a timely José Fonte interception.\n\nSouthampton should not wallow in this mismatch overly long. They have Internazionale to come here on Thursday in the Europa League, when Puel will seek an immediate response. They are more than capable of claiming that tie so impressive has their own recent form proved, but here it was Chelsea who imposed themselves more coherently. It took them 20 games and into the new year to gather this many points last season.

For many, the pain of watching Sunderland stumble yet again must have been simply too much but those early leavers missed out on some exquisite football from Arsenal and Alexis Sánchez in particular.\n\nSunderland 1-4 Arsenal: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nIf Arsène Wenger’s side continue playing as beguilingly as this there can be few complaints should they be crowned champions next spring. By then Sunderland – who have registered a record-equalling worst start to a Premier League campaign after collecting only two points from 10 games – will probably be relegated but, although wretched, this proved far from their worst display.\n\nDavid Moyes’s players worked hard enough, at one point pulling the score back to 1-1. It was just that they were embarrassingly outclassed, not to mention ripped apart by three visiting goals in eight devastating second-half minutes. The manager, though, looked for positives. “It wasn’t a difficult afternoon until the last 15 or 20 minutes. I didn’t think we collapsed – we did enough not to be beaten by that amount of goals. We’d grown into the game.”\n\nThe problem was that every time Sunderland upped the tempo, Arsenal elevated it higher as their hosts struggled to fathom the subtle sophistication of Sánchez’s often deep‑lying attacking performance during a chastening afternoon in which both he and the inspired substitute Olivier Giroud scored twice.\n\nSunderland had started quite well with Wahbi Khazri – a disappointment so far this season but integral to the avoidance of relegation last spring – offering brief cause for optimism. There was the cute dummy the Tunisia winger sold Mohamed Elneny, a couple of clever balls creating half-chances to the overlapping Billy Jones and Jermain Defoe, and a free-kick curved fractionally wide of a post.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Arsenal’s Alexis Sánchez celebrates opening the scoring against Sunderland at the Stadium of Light. Photograph: Owen Humphreys/PA\n\nBy then, though, Jack Rodwell had startled Arsenal by clattering into Francis Coquelin and Wenger’s players were beginning to raise their game. Such formidable resolve swiftly began rendering Sunderland’s positive beginning a cruel chimera. By half-time they had failed to direct a shot on target or win a corner.\n\nMeanwhile Wenger’s team were hitting their stride, highlighted as Sánchez’s beautifully angled pass dropped for Mesut Özil. When the playmaker’s first touch proved true, local hearts were in mouths but Özil’s second – a shot placed conveniently close to Jordan Pickford – suggested he was mortal after all.\n\nIt should have served as a warning to Lamine Koné and his fellow defenders but Koné was found wanting when, at the end of a bewitching Arsenal attack adorned by 22 passes, Alex Oxlade‑Chamberlain sashayed past the bewildered Duncan Watmore and crossed for Sánchez to head in from eight yards. Momentarily frozen, Koné paid the price for standing off.\n\nAlthough Defoe had a volley rightly disallowed for offside against Khazri, the London club had assumed control. They could have gone further ahead had Alex Iwobi not bent his shot marginally wide after a one-two with Kieran Gibbs, while bookings for Khazri, Didier Ndong and Steven Pienaar offered evidence of Sunderland’s struggle to contain the visitors.\n\nPremier League vulnerabilities add to the intrigue among a putative Big Six | Jonathan Wilson Read more\n\nMoyes’s mission was further complicated by Sánchez’s habit of dropping deep, Wenger’s supposed lone striker often taking up Özil’s No10 role. Small wonder Koné’s marking sometimes seemed confused. His department became even more disconnected when John O’Shea hobbled off to be replaced by the less reliable Papy Djilobodji, who was soon booked for a foul on Sánchez.\n\nSunderland rallied , finally forcing their guests to do some defending. Nonetheless Arsenal were furious not to be awarded a penalty when Koné felled Sánchez in the area. A few minutes later, Sunderland earned a spot-kick of their own after Petr Cech sent the accelerating Watmore sprawling. After the goalkeeper – careful to avoid potential dismissal by keeping his hands close to his body – was booked, Defoe scored from the spot but a most inspired substitution on Wenger’s part ensured it would be a strictly temporary respite.\n\nOn for Iwobi, Giroud scored with his first touch, volleying Gibbs’s cross past Pickford after another buildup featuring Sánchez. He then swiftly scored again, outmanoeuvring Djilobodji before heading in an Özil corner. Sánchez claimed the fourth from close range. All that remained was for Sunderland to be booed off – and Koné to swap shirts with Özil.\n\nAlthough Sunderland’s next two games at Bournemouth and at home to Hull City could yet prove pivotal, there remains no appetite on the part of Ellis Short, the owner, and Martin Bain, the chief executive, for sacking their seventh manager in five years.\n\n“I’m experienced,” Moyes said. “I’ll keep doing what I do.”\n\nA rather happier Wenger was delighted to not only see Sánchez excel in his unique but highly effective deep‑lying interpretation of the lone‑striker role but also to watch Giroud impose himself after stepping off the bench.\n\n“Sánchez is doing extremely well and Giroud is mentally strong,” Arsenal’s manager said. “Every time Olivier is questioned he gives you the right answer on the pitch. I admire him for that.”\n\nDelighted with his side’s “resolve”, he praised his players’ reaction to Jermain Defoe’s equalising penalty. “We had a great response,” he said. “This team wants to play well together.”"}, {"date": "29/10/2016", "arena": "Old Trafford", "attendance": 75325, "home_team": {"name": "Manchester United", "lineup": [{"name": "David De Gea", "yellows": [], "reds": [],

certainly eventful, with Manchester United going down to 10 men, José Mourinho being banished from the sidelines, Tom Heaton putting in another inspired goalkeeping performance and Burnley picking up their first away point of the season. Yet it was hardly the result the home side were looking for; it takes United back to square one after their midweek pick-me-up against Manchester City. Mourinho said beforehand he was looking forward to a long-awaited Sunday off, but relaxation is proving elusive for the manager holed up at Manchester’s Lowry hotel. He must answer an FA charge of making comments about the referee Anthony Taylor by Monday, and now faces probable suspension for confronting Mark Clattenburg in the tunnel at half-time.\n\nReturning to the football, as good as Heaton was, United could only be embarrassed by a total of 37 attempts, 11 of them on target, and no goals. That suggests poor finishing, and the assistant coach Rui Faria, sent to speak in place of Mourinho, did not disagree. “We are not happy,” he said. “We are creating a lot, we just have to keep believing the goals will come.”\n\nRoberto Firmino rounds off Liverpool’s goal rush at Crystal Palace Read more\n\nMourinho is now saying he needs time to turn United into winners because they have become unfamiliar with the habit, apparently forgetting that Chelsea had not done anything in the league for donkey’s years when he won the title in his first season at Stamford Bridge. United won the FA Cup only last season and the title three years before that, but time is presently standing still at Old Trafford. Watching United these days makes for longer afternoons than it used to.\n\nThe script was obvious here right from the start. Burnley would defend doggedly until such time as United scored and they were obliged to chase the game. United would see a lot of the ball and spend most of their time setting up attacks, but confronted with a side not sending too many players forward in search of a goal they would struggle to inject enough pace into the game to play at their preferred tempo. What the home supporters must have been praying for was an early goal, but due to Heaton’s goalkeeping heroics it never came.\n\nThe Burnley goalkeeper is the busiest in the Premier League, and with practice comes a predictable level of performance. Just as he had against Everton last week, Heaton prevented his opponents taking advantage of a slew of early chances. Zlatan Ibrahimovic saw a shot saved in the opening couple of minutes, quickly followed by Juan Mata as United moved the ball swiftly around the edge of Burnley’s box. A neat through ball from Mata put Ibrahimovic clean through but he was unable to lift the ball over the goalkeeper, then Heaton had to dive to his right to beat away a shot from Mata.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Tom Heaton saves spectacularly from Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Photograph: Alex Livesey/Getty Images\n\nIt was not quite all United. Sam Vokes put a shot wide then just failed to get the near-post touch he was looking for after Daley Blind temporarily lost Andre Gray, though the home side certainly finished the first half on top. Ben Mee turned up to block from Ibrahimovic, then Heaton produced a flying save to tip over Jesse Lingard’s header from Ander Herrera’s cross. Paul Pogba closed the half with a shot that also required helping over the bar, though it was significant that United’s goal attempts were coming from further and further out. A theatrical fall in the area by Matteo Darmian, in at right back because Antonio Valencia needed an operation on a broken arm, did not succeed in fooling Clattenburg, though Mourinho was sent to the stands for complaining too vehemently to the official at the break.\n\nSergio Agüero hits two as Manchester City thrash West Bromwich Albion Read more\n\nBurnley might have taken the lead at the start of the second half. Gray is quick and found himself with the whole of the United half to run into but Luke Shaw is no slouch either and caught up with the striker. After that it was back to business as usual, with Heaton stopping shots from Mata and then Lingard, though in the buildup to the latter Mata should have done better with Ibrahimovic’s cutback from the goalline. When Herrera’s cross reached Ibrahimovic at a slightly awkward height a goal seemed certain as the Swede shaped himself for a mid-air volley at the far post. He made good contact and was on target, only to find Heaton spreading himself Peter Schmeichel-style to keep the ball out with his arm. Ibrahimovic headed against the bar and the unlucky Mata struck an upright with a shot on the turn as United’s siege of the Burnley goal began to take on a comic dimension, before the game became even more intriguingly poised with Herrera’s dismissal. The midfielder had been booked in the first half for a foul on Dean Marney, and when he upended the same player again his only argument was that he slipped rather than launched himself.\n\nDesperate situations call for desperate measures, and Mourinho responded by sending on Wayne Rooney and Marouane Fellaini. He was probably desperate enough by that stage to throw in Henrikh Mkhitaryan too but he had once again neglected to name the Armenian among his substitutes. United had to make do with Memphis Depay instead. Like Rooney and Fellaini, he made little difference. United had a last-minute chance to win the game when Pogba found Ibrahimovic, who missed from close range, then one more in stoppage time when Blind rolled a free kick into Rooney’s path. Here was his moment, but from the edge of the area the ball finished up in the Stretford End.\n\nThere was the odd boo as the ground emptied, though the Burnley manager at least was impressed. “Personally, I thought United were first class, they are still a top side,” Sean Dyche said, before revealing he had discovered Mourinho had been dismissed only at the final whistle. “You get a little bit of freedom at places like this, no one expects Burnley to get anything. We know we still have to play better away from home, but we got a point.”"}, {"date": "29/10/2016", "arena": "Riverside Stadium", "attendance": 29600, "home_team": {"name": "Middlesbrough", "lineup": [{"name": "Victor Valdes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Antonio Barragan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Calum Chambers", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Gibson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "George Friend", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Forshaw", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Clayton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adama Traore", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Gaston Ramirez", "yellows": [24], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [39], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [63]}, {"name": "Stewart Downing", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [56], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Álvaro Negredo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [86]}], "subs": [{"name": "Fabio Da Silva", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bernardo Espinosa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Grant Leadbitter", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [63], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordan Rhodes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [86], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Viktor Fischer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Brad Guzan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Nugent", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Bournemouth", "lineup": [{"name": "Artur Boruc", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Smith", "yellows": [25], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Simon Francis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steve Cook", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charlie Daniels", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andrew Surman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Arter", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [73]}, {"name": "Joshua King", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Wilshere", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordon Ibe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [60]}, {"name": "Callum Wilson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [60]}], "subs": [{"name": "Dan Gosling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [73], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathan Aké", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Benik Afobe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [60], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Max Gradel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Federici", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Fraser", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [60], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tyrone Mings", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "The Middlesbrough manager Aitor Karanka claimed Gastón Ramírez’s jaw-dropping solo effort against Bournemouth came as no surprise to him. Ramírez opened his account for the season in quite remarkable fashion in Boro’s 2-0 victory, charging down a shot in his own half, gliding past two men as he raced the length of the pitch and finishing with style.\n\nRamírez’s time in England has been hit and miss, taking in mixed spells at Southampton and Hull, but he has found his place on Teesside and Karanka sees a player brimming with belief and capable of great moments.\n\n“It was no surprise for me,” the Spaniard said. “The main thing is he feels confident. When he is confident, he is an amazing player. I wanted him here last season and I said how important he is for this team. It is not a coincidence.”\n\nThat was as effusive as the individual praise got for the 25-year-old Uruguayan, with Karanka keen to spread the acclaim after a first home win of the campaign.\n\nUruguay talisman Gastón Ramírez is Middlesbrough’s man for all seasons Read more\n\n“We have really good players, real quality players. It is easier to score goals when you play as a team,” he said, deflecting the spotlight from his game-changer. “This is the way we know how to play. This is the way we are in the Premier League.\n\n“Behind Gastón we have 10 players, behind those 10 players we have another seven on the bench, and another six or seven in the stand. Today was important for us. It was a good day. We wanted to win at home especially because our crowd deserves the best. With them behind us, with our attitude, with our performance, we won the game.”\n\nStewart Downing prodded in Boro’s second at the far post after fine buildup work from Adama Traoré and Álvaro Negredo. It was the 32-year-old’s first goal in almost 18 months but that is a minor wait compared to his last Premier League goal for his hometown club, which came in May 2008.\n\n“I am really pleased because the work that he did today was amazing,” Karanka said. “Supporting [left-back] George Friend, supporting the midfielders, running back and forward.

"report": "There can be no doubt that Tottenham have the defence to win the title, given that it has taken them 10 matches to concede from open play this season, but Mauricio Pochettino needs his team to be as slick up front as they are stingy at the back if they are going to last the pace.\n\nThis was another blunt attacking performance from Tottenham, who lost ground on their rivals at the top after one slip allowed Leicester to cancel out Vincent Janssen’s penalty.\n\nStrange though it sounds to say that Pochettino has constructed the best defence in England after a game that featured the lively Ahmed Musa capitalising on Victor Wanyama’s error to earn Leicester their first away point of the season, to argue otherwise would be disingenuous. Instead that loss of concentration reminded Spurs that teams are always vulnerable when their attack does not carry enough of a threat.\n\nTottenham have scored 14 goals, nine fewer than Arsenal and City, and although they are likely to improve when Harry Kane recovers from his knee injury, Pochettino wants his creative players to play with more aggression and belief in the final third. “We need to be more clinical,” Tottenham’s manager said. “We need to score more.”\n\nIt is not a crisis. Spurs remain unbeaten, after all. But they have gone five games without a victory in all competitions, failing to win since outclassing City at the start of the month, and they have scored twice in their past three league matches. While Pochettino’s side had chances, hitting the woodwork in both halves, there was never a sense that Leicester were under siege.\n\nThis was a return to the solidity of last season from the champions. Organised and determined, the willingness of Claudio Ranieri’s players to throw their bodies in the way of countless shots heightened Tottenham’s frustration and ensured that Leicester were able to begin the healing process after their dramatic collapses at Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester United.\n\nDespite falling behind when Robert Huth’s foul presented Janssen with the opportunity to give Tottenham the lead from the penalty spot shortly before half-time, Leicester responded impressively instead of switching their focus to Wednesday’s trip to FC Copenhagen and Ranieri praised his team’s spirit, which was typified by Danny Drinkwater’s urgency in midfielder. The Italian was a vocal presence in the technical area, hollering at his players, urging them to keep their shape and discipline, and scowling whenever someone ignored his instructions.\n\nNeither side had anything more than half an eye on their midweek Champions League assignments and the game was full of crunching tackles, energetic running and furious pressing, but there was a need for a change of pace at times, someone to put a foot on the ball and introduce some subtlety.\n\nAll that blood and thunder made the search for space elusive. Dele Alli crashed a shot against the bar and saw another saved by Kasper Schmeichel. Yet Spurs lacked fluency without their Argentinian midfielder Erik Lamela, who was missing with illness. Son Heung-min probed without success and Christian Eriksen was poor, disappointing with his set-piece deliveries.\n\nLeicester looked to Riyad Mahrez for inspiration, regularly working the ball to the right flank in the first half. Danny Rose kept him quiet, however, save for the moment when the Algerian whipped in a cross that Shinji Okazaki glanced narrowly over. Christian Fuchs also rammed a volley over after Mahrez picked him out with a corner.\n\nTottenham’s breakthrough arrived when Huth, playing with fire, was penalised for hauling Janssen down after an Eriksen free-kick reached the striker after a spot of head tennis.\n\nHuth has never been a defender who respects the personal space of his opponents, although Ranieri felt that Janssen initiated the contact and fell softly. The referee, Robert Madley, pointed to the spot, though, and Janssen beat Schmeichel with a firm finish. Leicester have conceded 14 goals in their first five away games.\n\nDespite prodding wide in the second half, though, Janssen rarely looked mobile enough to lead the line for Spurs. He has scored three penalties since his £17m move from AZ Alkmaar and will need time to adapt to English football, yet the 22-year-old has struggled to fill in for Kane.\n\nAlthough Pochettino said that he is “really happy” with Janssen, he could do with the player he called his main striker. The manager said that Kane has a 50% chance of returning against Bayer Leverkusen at Wembley on Wednesday and a better one of being involved in the much-anticipated visit to Arsenal next Sunday. Tottenham need him fit as soon as possible.\n\nLeicester’s attacking edge will be sharper when Jamie Vardy regains his touch in front of goal. He has gone 11 games without scoring and miscontrolled when Musa sent him clear in the first half.\n\nVardy has plenty of other qualities, however, and he played a key role in Leicester’s equaliser early in the second half, racing clear on the right after Wanyama’s careless header and crossing for Musa, who forced the ball past Hugo Lloris at the far post.\n\nAs a measure of how difficult it is to score against Spurs from open play, perhaps nothing sums it up better than the way Musa had to put his body on the line. The winger briefly lay in a heap in the back of the net after colliding with Lloris, but it was worth the pain. Although Jan Vertonghen sent a late header against the bar, Tottenham could have used some of Musa’s persistence in attack.\n\nGastón Ramírez’s masterpiece helps Middlesbrough beat Bournemouth Read more"}, {"date": "29/10/2016", "arena": "Vicarage Road", "attendance": 20022, "home_team": {"name": "Watford", "lineup": [{"name": "Heurelho Gomes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sebastian Prödl", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [87]}, {"name": "Younes Kaboul", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [72]}, {"name": "Miguel Britos", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nordin Amrabat", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [85]}, {"name": "Roberto Pereyra", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Valon Behrami", "yellows": [53], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Etienne Capoue", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "José Holebas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Odion Ighalo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Troy Deeney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Adlene Guedioura", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Juan Camilo Zuniga", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [85], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jerome Sinclair", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daryl Janmaat", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [72], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Watson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Kabasele", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [87], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Costel Pantilimon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Hull City", "lineup": [{"name": "David Marshall", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Maguire", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Dawson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [82], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Curtis Davies", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ahmed Elmohamady", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Markus Henriksen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Jake Livermore", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Mason", "yellows": [57], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Samuel Clucas", "yellows": [58], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Abel Hernandez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Will Keane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [78]}], "subs": [{"name": "David Meyler", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [78], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Huddlestone", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shaun Maloney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eldin Jakupovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Weir", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Josh Tymon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jarrod Bowen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "It is fair to say the first top-flight meeting between these teams will not live long in the memory.

But you suffer in the big league and the deflection was cruel,” the Hull manager said.\n\n“We have to do better in the final third, but hopefully that will come with more hard work. We have to stick together and keep believing we are good enough to get ourselves out of this rut that we’ve been in. But the players are committed and I think we’ll be OK.”\n\nWalter Mazzarri, the Watford head coach, had insisted before the match that his players would not be distracted by the ongoing investigation into allegations that the club’s owners supplied false financial documents to the Football League in 2014. Fans showed their support before kick‑off with a giant banner featuring the joint-owner Gino Pozzo dressed in a suit and tie.\n\nHaving not played at home since drawing with Bournemouth four weeks ago, the players appeared eager to make up for lost time and almost went ahead early on when Younès Kaboul’s header crashed against the crossbar from Roberto Pereyra’s corner. The Argentinian playmaker picked up the loose ball and was unlucky to see his curling shot drift wide.\n\nGastón Ramírez’s masterpiece helps Middlesbrough beat Bournemouth Read more\n\nOn the evidence of the first five minutes, it was easy to see why Hull have been struggling. A three-man defence marshalled by the ageing captain, Dawson, is lacking in pace and they remain vulnerable on the flanks despite the abilities of Ahmed Elmohamady and Sam Clucas.\n\nHowever, after somehow weathering the early storm the visitors gradually found their feet. Ryan Mason tested Heurelho Gomes from distance and Abel Hernández was inches away from connecting with Elmohamady’s cross, only for Kaboul to come to Watford’s rescue.\n\nTroy Deeney will still be having nightmares about the chance he missed to score his 100th goal for the club just before the break, nodding wide from little more than a yard out.\n\nIt simply had to get better after the break and, scenting the chance of recording a fourth victory in their past five visits to Vicarage Road, Hull looked far more of a threat. They served notice of their intentions when Hernández raced on to Will Keane’s flick on but could only produce a weak effort that trickled into the gloves of Gomes.\n\nWatford continued to look the more likely to take the lead, although a lack of quality in the final third invariably let them down. Nordin Amrabat regularly found space behind Clucas but Odion Ighalo could not provide the finishing touch from another teasing cross.\n\nMazzarri abandoned his three-man defence and threw on Daryl Janmaat for Kaboul. It eventually had the desired effect when the Dutchman’s cross was deflected by Pereyra into the path of Dawson, who could only watch as the ball bounced off him and trickled into the net.\n\n“I always believed we could win it,” Mazzarri said. “They had some good counter-attacks in the second half but we controlled the ball and created chances. It was just the last pass that let us down. I’m very happy with my team but at the moment we don’t need to look at the table.” Phelan will be wishing he could say the same."}, {"date": "29/10/2016", "arena": "The Hawthorns", "attendance": 22470, "home_team": {"name": "West Bromwich Albion", "lineup": [{"name": "Ben Foster", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Craig Dawson", "yellows": [16], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gareth McAuley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonas Olsson", "yellows": [21], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [51]}, {"name": "Allan Nyom", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonny Evans", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nacer Chadli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [87]}, {"name": "Darren Fletcher", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [51]}, {"name": "Chris Brunt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James McClean", "yellows": [56], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Salomón Rondón", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Hal Robson-Kanu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [87], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Morrison", "yellows": [53], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [51], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Craig Gardner", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matt Phillips", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Boaz Myhill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Brendan Galloway", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonathan Leko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [51], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Manchester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Claudio Bravo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fernando", "yellows": [76], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Stones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nicolás Otamendi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aleksandar Kolarov", "yellows": [62], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "IIkay Gündogan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [79, 90], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fernandinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Raheem Sterling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [77]}, {"name": "David Silva", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [83]}, {"name": "Nolito", "yellows": [15], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [68]}, {"name": "Sergio Agüero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [19, 28], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Vincent Kompany", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willy Caballero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jesus Navas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [77], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin De Bruyne", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [68], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gael Clichy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kelechi Iheanacho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aleix García Serrano", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [83], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "The dry spell is over – in more ways than one. Manchester City had not won since Sergio Agüero’s last goal, away against Swansea City on 24 September, but seven games later the Argentina striker found the net twice in the first half to catapult Pep Guardiola’s team past an uninspiring West Bromwich Albion and back to the top of the table, where Arsenal had momentarily displaced them earlier in the afternoon.\n\nIlkay Gündogan, who looks increasingly comfortable, capped a terrific individual showing with two goals late on in what was perhaps City’s most dominant performance under Guardiola.\n\nThat comes with a caveat, though, because their opponents were plagued by hesitancy to such an extent that their own fans chided them sarcastically before half-time with a chant of “We’ve got the ball” when they had managed half a dozen successful passes.\n\nLeicester’s Ahmed Musa strikes to frustrate blunt Tottenham Read more\n\nMuch had been said about Guardiola’s longest spell without a victory but this response was emphatic, no matter the welcoming nature of their hosts. He said the three points were the most pleasing aspect of a commanding afternoon but the performance must also be a confidence boost before the Champions League meeting with his former club Barcelona on Tuesday.\n\nThe only period they were put under any degree of pressure was midway through the second half when two goals in front. “We are still learning how to improve in the second half, it’s difficult to control 90 minutes,” Guardiola said.\n\nAlbion’s best chance when still in the game came in the opening couple of minutes when Nacer Chadli shot over, and their only attempt on target was a tame 67th-minute free-kick.\n\nInstead they spent much of the match pinned back by a visiting side that hardly broke sweat. That Ben Foster had managed the same amount of touches as both wingers, Chris Brunt and James McClean, by the interval spoke volumes for the level of control exerted by City in the opening 45 minutes. “They didn’t push up,” Guardiola said, “so we had time to think about it.”\n\nWatford burst Hull City’s hopes thanks to Michael Dawson’s late own goal Read more\n\nAgüero’s first arrived in the 19th minute following an exquisite through ball from Gündogan. The striker composed himself before rifling low past Foster from a tight angle in a slick, almost effortless move that made the West Brom back four appear mannequin-like.\n\nThe hosts’ attempt to protect a clean sheet was understandable but their dismal response to falling behind was to concede even more of the ball. Gündogan, alongside David Silva in the centre of a four-man line of attacking midfielders, seemed to enjoy every moment.\n\nTony Pulis, who signed a new contract on Friday much to the frustration of a substantial portion of Albion supporters, had sought to stifle City’s midfield by pairing Darren Fletcher with Jonny Evans but Gündogan and Silva found continuous joy.\n\nIndeed, West Brom’s marking for Agüero’s second was the opposite of stifling. Neither Jonas Olsson nor Gareth McAuley were alert enough to intercept a loose ball on the edge of the area, allowing Agüero time to take possession, turn and send a stunning effort into the top-right corner from the penalty arc. His finish was immaculate but the 28-year-old should never have been allowed the opportunity in the first place.\n\n“They were too good for us, had too much quality,” said the Albion assistant manager, Dave Kemp, who was sent by Pulis to address the media. “The players we’re playing against are top drawer. They’re not coming down from the job centre. They’re very, very good.”\n\nJosé Mourinho sent to stands as Manchester United are held by Burnley Read more\n\nAlbion did grow into the game briefly when Jonathan Leko and James Morrison were sprung from the bench 10 minutes after half-time – the latter came on for Fletcher, who was harshly jeered off – but their end product remained so limited. Even when they finally made Claudio Bravo work it was bread and butter for the goalkeeper, who smothered a low, tame free-kick from Brunt.\n\nCity continued to threaten on a regular basis. Nolito, who was booked for lashing out at Craig Dawson in the first half, accidentally obstructed a pair of goal-bound efforts from Silva and Gündogan, while Raheem Sterling, turning in another lively performance on the right, shot over following a botched Allan Nyom clearance.\n\nFoster denied Agüero a tap-in for his hat-trick in the 72nd minute when getting his leg in front of a Kevin De Bruyne cross. The Belgian, sufferer of a calf twinge against Southampton last week, was introduced for the final quarter – another boost for Guardiola before Barcelona visit the Etihad.\n\nAgüero unselfishly turned architect for Gündogan’s first goal, jigging along the edge of the area before his lofted through-ball was deflected by McAuley into the German’s path. Unmarked, and with time on his hands, Gündogan finished low past Foster for his second goal in a City shirt.\n\nHis third followed in the final minute, a simple tap-in from De Bruyne’s cross from on the left, though Albion already looked to have thrown in the towel. “He has so much quality,” Guardiola said. “He is really good with the ball, especially when attacking one on one with defenders.”"},

League’s pacesetters flexed their attacking muscles, Liverpool relied on their own lust for goals to turn a potentially awkward contest into a celebration of blistering intent.\n\nCrystal Palace contributed to a captivating encounter, twice pegging back Liverpool as they endeavoured to contain the surges from the away team – no mean feat – but Jürgen Klopp’s team were in one of those moods where they ooze goals. Philippe Coutinho and Roberto Firmino showcased bewitching skills. Sadio Mané should have helped himself to a strike or two himself. There was so much forward momentum it was not unreasonable to forget they even had Daniel Sturridge back waiting in those familiar wings.\n\nAs it was, the selection comprised a team goal based on slick passing, two set pieces and a sumptuous lob. All very tasty from Klopp’s perspective. He might well wonder about eradicating some of the defensive wobbles. But that is a poser for another day. Playing like this, Liverpool can be confident that if the opposition score, they will simply outscore them. They extended their dazzling run, picking up their sixth win from their last seven Premier League games and had verve to burn.\n\n“Sorry for this boring performance,” Klopp quipped at the end of it all. Then he acknowledged that while the inherent characteristics of his team help them to overcome defensive deficiencies he would sooner have a little more cool control. “We cannot strike back every day, but we are good enough to find a solution in situations like this,” he said. “But since I am at Liverpool I am happy with the character of my boys.”\n\nCrystal Palace v Liverpool: Premier League - live! Read more\n\nIt still seems unfeasibly early to be stoking up a title-chase narrative before Halloween, but such is the bunched-up nature at the top, all eyes turned to Liverpool after Arsenal and then Manchester City swept to three emphatically won points earlier in the day. What ensued, in a helter-skelter match, was extraordinary. Goals always seemed likely given the encouragement Klopp gives his forwards to raid in a high-energy pack coupled with Crystal Palace’s clean sheet allergy this season.\n\nFrom the 16th to the 21st minute it rained goals. Liverpool went ahead when the vibrant Coutinho’s scooped pass fell to Alberto Moreno, who hooked the ball back across goal. Emre Can arrived unmarked and his shot ricocheted in.\n\nPerhaps some of smoke from the firecrackers hurled from the away end got in Dejan Lovren’s eye, as there was no obvious explanation for the undercooked back pass which gifted Palace a route back into the game. James McArthur was on hand to score with a clever header, nudging the ball instinctively over the onrushing Loris Karius.\n\nThe irresistible law of making up for painful mistakes ensured Lovren took centre stage again three minutes later. When Liverpool won a corner he was on point to beat his marker Scott Dann, thumping his team back into the lead with a header.\n\nJosé Mourinho sent to stands as Manchester United are held by Burnley Read more\n\nLiverpool’s threat bubbled constantly. The thirst for goals throughout the team is obvious and there could have been more as Firmino’s attempt was blocked by Joel Ward, Moreno struck a post and Mané scooped over with a free shot.\n\nIn the spirit of the goal glut, Palace responded. Christian Benteke glanced the ball to Wilfried Zaha, whose inviting cross was met by none other than McArthur. Having already patted his head in astonishment after his first goal, he was at it again after nipping ahead of Lovren to steer in another equaliser.\n\nThe heading contest was far from over. The crowd were almost confounded by disbelief as yet another looked goalbound – this time from Coutinho – only for Steve Mandanda to scramble the ball superbly on to the frame of the goal.\n\nIt came as no surprise when Liverpool duly did the deed again. Just before half‑time Coutinho delivered a corner for Joël Matip to meet with full power. Pardew lamented that the game was “a bit too open for us against a side as good as they are”, which was an honest enough appraisal.\n\nCoutinho was at the heart of so much that was positive about Liverpool. Klopp rightly enthused about how much effort he puts in: “He is 24. His work rate is outstanding. You cannot be a genius every day so you have to be a proper football player. That is how the boys are.”\n\nOlivier Giroud and Alexis Sánchez at the double as Arsenal ease past Sunderland Read more\n\nPalace returned after the restart intent on coming back into it again. Benteke was dominant (Klopp intriguingly described his performance as “warm”), taking aim at Karius’s goal on a number of occasions. Zaha looked plaintively at the referee as he bid for a couple of penalties but Andre Marriner was unmoved.

Southampton produced a disciplined and dynamic display to deny City a first win since late September on an afternoon John Stones will want to forget.\n\nPep Guardiola: I will fight to find out why Manchester City are on bad run Read more\n\nAn error from the England centre-back handed Nathan Redmond a goal in the first half, the defender woefully misplacing a pass, and an effort of his own was ruled out moments later. Kelechi Iheanacho’s second-half equaliser could have prompted a swift resurgence but it is easy to see why this Southampton side have progressed so significantly in recent weeks.\n\nClaude Puel has established a high-pressing attack and well-organised defensive unit. They thwarted City’s attempts at a comeback and the result means Guardiola has not won a league game in three for the first time since the end of the 2014-15 season at Bayern Munich. It is the first time he has gone without a win in five overall since 2009.\n\n“We had problems creating in the buildup; it was slow,” said Guardiola. “We had problems to make the difference, one against one and two v one. In the second half the players changed their mentality, the way to rebel against the situation. Unfortunately we could not win. Again we conceded a goal when the opponent didn’t make anything. It’s difficult to recover the mentality from that.\n\n“It happened in Glasgow [against Celtic]. What the opponents do, they don’t create too much and it’s not too easy when you give them [chances]. But I don’t think today that’s the reason why we didn’t win. The difference between the first half and second half was obvious.”\n\nIt is a strange conundrum that City remain top of the Premier League yet Guardiola arguably faces his biggest managerial challenge for many years. There was evident tension emanating from the stands throughout a challenging afternoon and even a smattering of boos at the half-time whistle.\n\nVincent Kompany and Sergio Agüero returned to the starting line-up after the 4-0 defeat in Barcelona, with Guardiola selecting a three-man defence including the Belgian, Stones and Aleksandar Kolarov. That defence was put under intense pressure by Southampton’s forward triumvirate of Redmond, Charlie Austin and Dusan Tadic and City were unable to register a single first-half shot on target for the first time in 15 matches under Guardiola.\n\nCredit must go to Puel and Southampton, who never permitted Claudio Bravo an easy option when the Chilean goalkeeper was looking to distribute quickly. The Saints were similarly focused in defence, José Fonte and Virgil van Dijk demonstrating why they had conceded only seven Premier League goals before this match.\n\nGoalmouth action was limited during an opening half played with little space. Jordy Clasie blazed over Bravo’s crossbar after a slick Southampton move on 20 minutes and soon after Kevin De Bruyne almost slid Agüero through one-on-one.\n\nHowever, the turning point came through Stones’s error, a major lapse in concentration from the defender in the 28th minute. The former Everton centre-half played a blind pass back to Kompany, misdirecting it severely and laying the ball on a plate for Redmond, who rounded Bravo to finish coolly.\n\nPerhaps such faux pas should be expected as City adapt to Guardiola’s approach of consistently playing out from the back. Stones thought he had made immediate amends when finishing well from De Bruyne’s deep free-kick, only for the linesman to signal offside against Agüero.\n\nManchester City 1-1 Southampton: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nThe atmosphere was subdued to say the least and City’s first valid shot came only in the 38th minute, although Ilkay Gündogan dragged tamely wide. Iheanacho replaced De Bruyne at half-time and City upped their intensity.\n\nIt was Iheanacho who brought them level in the 55th minute with a well-worked goal. Fernandinho sprayed a fine ball over the top for Leroy Sané, who pulled back across the penalty area for the Nigerian youngster to finish first time into the bottom corner.\n\nCity’s increased pressure coincided with a succession of yellow cards, as tempers rose. Iheanacho certainly added a new dynamic and almost squared for David Silva as blue shirts began to swarm forward in numbers.\n\nGündogan and Silva forced excellent saves from Fraser Forster before Austin had a fine opportunity after being fed by the substitute Sofiane Boufal, only to fire straight at Bravo. Jesús Navas was brought on to replace Kompany late on but City could not craft clear opportunities despite late pressure.\n\nIt was a rather tepid ending to City’s afternoon but one Southampton celebrated. Puel said: “I’m happy of course for the point, the spirit and fantastic mentality. It was a difficult game against a good team. They [City] can press well and make it difficult to play our game. I think in the second half we had good defensive organisation.\n\n“It was important to change the team [after the defeat at Internazionale]. Manchester City had more time to prepare. We finished the last game against Inter with big disappointment and it was important today to show our fantastic spirit and good organisation. It’s a good point for us.”"}, {"date": "23/10/2016", "arena": "Stamford Bridge", "attendance": 41424, "home_team": {"name": "Chelsea", "lineup": [{"name": "Thibaut Courtois", "yellows": [], "reds":

"report": "For José Mourinho perhaps the only consolation from a traumatic day is that the Chelsea supporters were not impertinent enough to barrack the returning manager or gloat too much at his misfortune other than the chorus of “olés” that formed the soundtrack to parts of the ordeal.\n\nNot that there was any discernible sympathy, either. They did not sing his name until the fourth goal went in and, when the public announcer mentioned his presence before kick-off, it was a strange kind of indifference bearing in mind, as he frequently reminds us, nobody else has brought more trophies or drama to this stadium. The match started, Chelsea took the lead before a single player in red had touched the ball and nothing will have hurt Mourinho more than his team’s capitulation and the impression it left that the modern-day Manchester United are a long way behind the great Chelsea sides he once managed.\n\nIt was certainly remarkable to see a team who defended with such resilience at Liverpool last Monday look so vulnerable and accident-prone. Chelsea were ahead after 29 seconds and Pedro’s early breakthrough set the tone. This was the most satisfying victory of Antonio Conte’s short reign at Stamford Bridge. It was also Mourinho’s worst experience in United’s employment and the defeat was compounded by a potentially serious injury to Eric Bailly, thought to be damaged knee ligaments.\n\nFor the most part Mourinho was remarkably undemonstrative, hands embedded in his pockets, while a few yards to his left Conte was never still –cajoling, pointing, shouting, leaping and generally doing his best impression of a man with his socks on fire. Occasionally, though, Mourinho would just hold out his arms, as if imploring his players for more or asking what was going on. He has rarely looked so helpless and it was almost a surprise Chelsea did not make it even more harrowing for him after N’Golo Kanté cracked in the fourth with 20 minutes still to play. Gary Neville, in his television role, described United’s defending as “garbage”. Mourinho called it “humiliating” and Chelsea found great joy exposing their opponents on the day the London club marked the 20th anniversary of Matthew Harding’s death.\n\nPerhaps an argument could be made that United might have been spared if David Luiz had been shown the red card he deserved for a studs-up challenge on Marouane Fellaini late in the first half. It would, however, be a flimsy argument given the scale of the away team’s inadequacies. They were already two goals down by that stage. Chelsea had quickly sensed their opponents’ shortcomings and the game had not even reached the half-hour before Mourinho instructed his substitutes to warm up, as if contemplating changes.\n\nChelsea moved the ball with speed and purpose. They are unbeaten now in their past 11 fixtures against United and they soaked in the “olés” during that period late on when Conte was able to remove Eden Hazard and Diego Costa, two of the chief tormentors. Kanté, football’s own Duracell bunny, is starting to look like the all-action hero who helped Leicester City to the title. Costa is always better when he plays to his strengths rather than picking imaginary fights and, though the Premier League’s leading scorer was not on target, he was a key figure.\n\nUnited did sporadically threaten but no team can defend this generously and expect to get away with it. Costa might be the first opponent this season who has physically overwhelmed Bailly. Daley Blind was far too susceptible and Smalling, more than anyone, must have been in Mourinho’s mind when the manager talked of “incredible defensive mistakes”.\n\nSmalling wore the captain’s armband in the absence of Wayne Rooney, missing here with a training-ground injury, but this is far from the only time he had come up short and he must bear a degree of liability for three of the goals.\n\nKanté beat him far too easily to complete the rout and, eight minutes earlier, Hazard had also eluded the same player when Chelsea moved into a 3-0 lead. Hazard had threatened all afternoon and Juan Mata, who replaced Fellaini at half‑time, did not track his run in the passing exchange, involving Kanté and Nemanja Matic, that finished with the Belgian aiming a low shot to David De Gea’s left.\n\nConte’s only complaint seemed to be that the crowd were not showing enough appreciation in the last few minutes. His gesturing to raise the volume promoted a whispered lecture from Mourinho at the final whistle – a classic diversion technique, regular José-watchers might suspect – but that should not dilute Conte’s satisfaction about the way the game panned out after an eccentric start. Costa took the kick-off, Chelsea embarked on some routine keep-ball possession, then Marcos Alonso turned a long pass forwards, giving Pedro something to chase, and it must have been startling for Mourinho to see the way Smalling, Blind and De Gea let the former Barcelona player beat them all.\n\nBlind was the first to dither. Smalling was even more disoriented, though to give him the benefit of the doubt he might also have been distracted by the sudden appearance of De Gea, charging out of his penalty area when it would have been much wiser to stay put. Pedro deserves credit for his speed and anticipation but from United’s perspective it was a succession of errors. Pedro’s first touch took him wide of De Gea, leaving the goalkeeper hopelessly exposed, and he made the left-foot finish look easier than it probably was. “Incredible,” Mourinho lamented of his team’s defending, “and I say ‘incredible’ in capitals.”\n\nThe second goal came from Hazard’s corner and an accidental ricochet off Ander Herrera that left Gary Cahill with the chance to take aim from six yards out. His volley went in off Blind and the referee Martin Atkinson’s failure to send off Luiz four minutes before the interval, showing him only a yellow card, meant it was always unlikely the home side would surrender their winning position.\n\nInstead, United had to chase the game and that, in turn, meant leaving more gaps in defence. Chelsea could not match their 5-0 victory against United from October 1999 but they did show Mourinho they can get by without him.\n\n“We are six points from the top of the league, not 16,” the United manager argued.

Sissoko’s incident was the most blatant with the midfielder, having come on as a 72nd-minute substitute, clearly striking Harry Arter with his elbow as the pair tussled by the near touchline. Arter was enraged and complained to Pawson, but the official, despite having a clear view of what had happened, took no action. That was also the case on 40 minutes, when Lamela lunged in on Dan Gosling having already received a yellow card. The Argentinian’s reaction was that of a man who expected to be dismissed, but he survived.\n\nNot surprisingly, Sissoko’s foul on Arter was raised with both managers and, perhaps also not surprisingly, both claimed not to have seen the flashpoint.

The players delivered an incredible physical performance, full of endeavour and desire.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bournemouth’s Adam Smith hooks the ball away from Christian Eriksen. Photograph: Steve Paston/PA\n\nIn that regard, no one shone more brightly than Arter, who closed down opposition players with relentless desire and was quite rightly named man of the match Yet, as Howe intimated, this was a collectively impressive display by the hosts as they looked to push Tottenham back right from kick-off. Callum Wilson led the charge, with the lone centre-forward ably supported by the attacking trio of Joshua King, Jack Wilshere and Jordon Ibe. Behind them Arter and Gosling, who came into the starting lineup just before kick-off after Andrew Surman was ruled out because of illness, restricted the ability of Mousa Dembélé and Deli Alli to dictate proceedings and cause danger from centre midfield in their usual manner.\n\nBournemouth had the best chance of the match, a close-range shot from Charlie Daniels after five minutes that looked to be heading in, only for Hugo Lloris to deflect the ball on to the bar with this leg and make a second eye-catching stop in four days after his stunning block of Javier Hernández’s close-range strike in Tuesday’s Champions League draw with Bayer Leverkusen.\n\nLamela almost scored for Tottenham on 17 minutes with a long-range drive but, overall, the visitors were left feeling frustrated during the first half, evident in part by the four bookings they collected during that period. A fifth, and second, for their No11 would have been justified.\n\nThe rebel World Cup: on the road with Kurdistan's football team Read more\n\nThe visitors were much improved after the break and deserved to remain the only undefeated team in the Premier League given they had the lion’s share of possession – 61.8% – and created more chances than Bournemouth – 16 compared to eight. However, few of those chances were clear cut and Son Heung-Min was largely anonymous as their lone striker. It is now one goal for Tottenham in their last three games. Harry Kane’s return from injury cannot come quickly enough.\n\n“The game was tough but I am pleased with the efforts of my players,” said Pochettino before going on to concede his side needs to be more ruthless if they are to sustain their title charge. Tottenham are fourth, one point off new leaders Arsenal.\n\nFor Bournemouth, it is now four matches without defeat and soon after Sissoko’s strike on Arter – who said he received an apology from the Tottenham player for the elbow, which he accepted, saying “he isn’t that type of player” – there was one more moment for the majority of those in attendance to feel hard done by.\n\nWilshere – who completed a full match for the first time since September 2014 – went down under a seemingly illegal challenge from Victor Wanyama inside the Tottenham area.

The Arsenal manager is no hell-raiser and he has long had his leg pulled about his idea of a big night, which – according to legend – has to feature German third division football. One thing was plain after this anti-climactic comedown from Wednesday’s 6-0 Champions League win against Ludogorets. His 67th birthday bash would have been the dampest of squibs.\n\nWenger’s moods are entirely dependent on the results of his team and this was one of those that they throw in every now and then – sometimes when they are least expected. Arsenal had entered the game as the form team in England, having won seven on the spin in all competitions, while Middlesbrough had never had so few Premier League points after the first eight matches of a season. But Arsenal could not find their fluency – they were slow and flat, and it was surprising to see how few clearcut chances they created.\n\nIt was Middlesbrough who distinguished themselves and if anybody deserved to win then it was them. Aitor Karanka got his tactics spot-on and, with the right-winger, Adama Traoré, showcasing his pace and power, they had the opportunities to take more than the one point. Petr Cech saved Arsenal three times in the first half and he would be worked again by Traoré in the second period.\n\nWenger admitted that Arsenal “could have lost the game in the first half” and he lamented his team’s lack of pace, creativity and sharpness in the combinations. He also felt they had paid “a little price” for their exertions against Ludogorets, even if it had not looked like a particularly taxing evening. “I have a frustrated face,” Wenger added. “But, at least, we were intelligent enough not to lose.”\n\nArsenal dominated possession but they struggled to outmanoeuvre Karanka’s reworked midfield. Instead of using his usual 4-2-3-1 formation, the Boro manager asked Adam Clayton to anchor a central midfield trio, with Adam Forshaw and Marten de Roon either side of him. In the absence of a No10, Gaston Ramírez started off the left.\n\nMiddlesbrough’s problems had been well-documented – the dismal run of results, the lack of creativity and goals – but they made light of them. If nobody could have predicted how disjointed Arsenal would have looked, then it was still a surprise to see the visitors as the more dangerous team, particularly in the first half.\n\nThey had chances and they were glorious ones – particularly the third of them, when Traoré crossed, Álvaro Negredo and Laurent Koscielny challenged for the ball and it looped up to the unmarked Ramírez at the far post. His header packed a punch but it was too close to Cech, who blocked instinctively.\n\nKaranka’s team had first carved Arsenal open in the 19th minute, following Negredo’s flick from Daniel Ayala’s high ball forward. Koscielny moved across to deal with the loose ball but he was robbed by Traoré, who blasted away from him and made for the area. Confronted by Cech, his shot was saved and, when the ball broke to Negredo, the goalkeeper saved again. Negredo ought to have done better. Middlesbrough could also point to Ramírez’s whipped free-kick moments later, which came back off the crossbar.\n\nArsenal flickered – they always do – but there was no one chance that they could look back upon with particular regret.\n\nIt was Alexis Sánchez who was central to what they did muster. The centre-forward went close with two free-kicks while he twice forced Víctor Valdés into smart saves in open play. There was also the moment shortly after half-time when Valdés, the former Barcelona goalkeeper, failed to claim a high ball and Sánchez chipped it back into the middle for Koscielny. The cross was over-hit.\n\nLike the Swansea City winger Modou Barrow here last weekend, Traoré had plenty of joy; there was worry among the home support whenever he tore forward on the counterattack. He went close on 59 minutes, after a surging run and low shot for the far corner – Cech tipped it around the post – and, with time almost up, he drove again and played in Negredo. Koscielny stretched to make the saving challenge.\n\n“We deserved to win,” Karanka said. “Our concentration was good throughout. The fact that Cech was Arsenal’s best player says that we did a really good job. Now, we have a very important home game against Bournemouth next Saturday.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Arsène Wenger expresses his frustration on a day when Santi Cazorla’s absence felt crucial.

They have yet to pick up anything on their travels but after inflicting only a second league defeat of the season on Ronald Koeman’s side they can claim home wins against Liverpool and Everton.\n\nTurf Moor must have some sort of hoodoo over Merseyside, though there was nothing mysterious about this result. Burnley made two clear chances and took them both. Everton had a pile of pressure but little in the way of final product. It was almost like a rerun of events in the 1-1 draw with Manchester City at the Etihad last week, though this time it was Everton who were left feeling they had been mugged.\n\nLeicester back on track as Shinji Okazaki shines in win over Crystal Palace Read more\n\n“It’s hard to take, going home with no points, but it happens,” Koeman said. “Football is really unfair sometimes. You don’t always get what you deserve.”\n\nDyche knows all about that, after Arsenal’s dubious late winner in Burnley’s previous home game, but his theory that luck evens out over a season seems to be holding up. “We were a bit lucky, but we still had to earn it,” the Burnley manager said. “Everton are a fine side and we did well to stay in the game, not to mention scoring two terrific goals.”\n\nBurnley were riding their luck right from the start when a Yannick Bolasie run caused panic in Everton’s first attack. The ball ran free to leave Kevin Mirallas a presentable shooting opportunity from close to the penalty spot and Tom Heaton had to rescue his side with a point-blank save. The Burnley goalkeeper was in action again after a quarter of an hour, diving to his left to beat out a shot from Ross Barkley, restored to the Everton side after being left out last week at City.\n\nWith Ben Mee foiling Romelu Lukaku in the act of shooting and Mirallas seeing another effort blocked by Scott Arfield on the edge of the penalty area, Everton must have been beginning to feel like City in that game – well on top but constantly thwarted by last-ditch defending. It appeared to be only a matter of time before Burnley conceded, yet as Koeman admitted Everton’s intensity dipped after a bright start.\n\nEven so it was a surprise when Burnley took the lead just before the interval. The Etihad hero Maarten Stekelenburg will not be so seen to watch replays of this weekend’s work. Though he did well to get down to an Arfield shot that picked up a deflection on the way through, he neither claimed the ball or pushed it to safety and ended up offering the easiest of tap-ins to Sam Vokes, who had been following up more in hope than expectation.\n\nStoke City add to Hull’s woe thanks to Xherdan Shaqiri’s brilliance Read more\n\nThe second half began with a sharper-looking Everton swarming around the Burnley penalty area in search of an equaliser. A cross from Mirallas was fizzed along the six-yard line a touch too firmly for Lukaku to reach, but they were once again finding gaps to exploit in the Burnley defence and were back on terms after an hour. When a positional error by Mee allowed Lukaku a clear run at goal from Idrissa Gueye’s pass, the striker found Bolasie at his elbow practically nudging him off the ball in his eagerness to take over the chance.\n\nIf that took some confidence after the finishing prowess Lukaku showed in a similar situation at City, Bolasie did not disappoint, powering into the area to shoot early and decisively past Heaton.\n\nThat left over half an hour for Everton to come up with a winner, and even with Gerard Deulofeu sent on to join Bolasie in making life uncomfortable for the home full-backs, they could not manage it. Though Burnley rarely crossed the halfway line following the equaliser, it turned out they were merely biding their time. “They waited for one moment and got it,” a rueful Koeman said.\n\nBurnley put together a determined attack in the final minute and for the second time caught Everton cold. Johann Berg Gudmundsson’s shot crashed against the bar, and before the defence could congratulate themselves on a lucky escape, Arfield expertly stuck away the rebound.

If he continues in the same vein and shows the same application, there’s more goals to come from him.”\n\nStoke followed up last week’s first league win of the season against Sunderland with their first league success on the road after Shaqiri ran the show at the KCom Stadium.\n\n“He’s in good shape,” the Stoke manager added. “He’s come back this season with real purpose and he’s very positive in every aspect of his work.\n\n“Maybe last season he was getting to grips with the Premier League to a certain extent, but he feels, and looks, totally accustomed to the league now and has had a real impact in the games that he’s played for us.”\n\nHull slipped into the bottom three following their fifth straight Premier League defeat and Hughes spared a thought for his former Manchester United team-mate Mike Phelan, who has lost both his matches since being given the Hull job on a permanent basis. “It’s difficult at the moment for Mike, but he’s a very experienced football man and it’s a big opportunity for him,” Hughes said. “I’ve known him for many years and he’s very conscientious and works exceptionally hard and I think he’s going to make big changes. It’s not easy, but he knows the game and knows what he wants from his players and I expect him to turn things round very quickly.”\n\nHull’s impressive start to the season under Phelan seems a long time ago – they beat the champions, Leicester, and Swansea in their first two matches – and Phelan struggled to find anything positive to say about the performance. “It’s extremely disappointing,” the manager said. “First half really we weren’t proactive in passing the ball well and off the ball and we came unstuck to an exceptional first goal from a quality player, who’s capable of doing these things.”\n\nPhelan’s side were humbled 6-1 at Bournemouth in their previous match and Phelan admitted his players were low on confidence.\n\n“It was low, you could see certainly in the first half opportunities to pass to each other, control, make the right movements, it just wasn’t happening for us. So we have to take stock of that and look at those issues and look forward to the next game.”\n\nOne positive for Phelan was the return of the captain, Michael Dawson, who made his first appearance of the season. Dawson, fully recovered from a knee injury sustained in the summer, made a superb last-ditch tackle to deny Wilfried Bony his first goal of the season.\n\n“Michael Dawson’s the right character to have around,” Phelan said. “He’s been there, seen it and done it. It was good. His first 90 minutes. So that was one pleasing aspect.”\n\nArsenal celebrate Wenger’s birthday but ride luck to hold Middlesbrough Read more"}, {"date": "22/10/2016", "arena": "The King Power Stadium", "attendance": 31969, "home_team": {"name": "Leicester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Kasper Schmeichel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Simpson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wes Morgan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robert Huth", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Fuchs", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [80], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Riyad Mahrez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Drinkwater", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andy King", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [87]}, {"name": "Ahmed Musa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [42], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [81]}, {"name": "Shinji Okazaki", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [63], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Islam Slimani", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [75]}], "subs": [{"name": "Jamie Vardy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [75], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marc Albrighton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daniel Amartey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [87], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jeffrey Schlupp", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ron-Robert Zieler", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Demarai Gray", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [81], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leonardo Ulloa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Crystal Palace", "lineup": [{"name": "Steve Mandanda", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joel Ward", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Tomkins", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Damien Delaney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Kelly", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [77]}, {"name": "James McArthur", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Ledley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [72]}, {"name": "Andros Townsend", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [72]}, {"name": "Yohan Cabaye", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [85], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wilfried Zaha", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Benteke", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Mathieu Flamini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fraizer Campbell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [72], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wayne Hennessey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chung-Yong Lee", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [72], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Zeki Fryers", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [77], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Connor Wickham", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bakary Sako", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "This was more like the stuff of champions. Claudio Ranieri said he did not recognise his team when they folded at Chelsea but his players reintroduced themselves to him with style against Crystal Palace.\n\n“This was our best performance of the season,” said the manager, who revealed he had demanded his players deliver a performance to kickstart their domestic campaign. “I said maybe this would be the basement of our Premier League season, so it was important to win. We won, we played well and the only thing I didn’t like was that Crystal Palace scored, but I have to recognise they deserved that.”\n\nPalace did deserve it, because they contributed to a vibrant contest, but Alan Pardew did not dispute the outcome was correct and Leicester look back on song. “I saw their game against Chelsea and they didn’t have the same verve and aggression they had here,” he said. “We weren’t far from our best but they were good. I think most teams are going to find it difficult here.”\n\nTottenham miss chance to go top at Bournemouth but escape red cards Read more\n\nFor a while Palace looked like they were on Easy Street, threatening in the first 20 minutes to become the first visitors for more than a year to leave the King Power with a Premier League win. That was despite the fact the Palace goalkeeper, Steve Mandanda, gifted Shinji Okazaki a chance to open the scoring in the second minute, miskicking straight to the Japan striker, whose lob dropped wide. Palace then took charge and nearly scored when Christian Benteke leapt above a motionless Robert Huth to meet a cross by Martin Kelly. The Belgian’s header bounced out off the bar.\n\nLeicester then reaffirmed the order of things. They began to outfight Palace all over the pitch and topped that off with flashes of class from Okazaki, Riyad Mahrez and Danny Drinkwater, in particular. Despite European commitments, Ranieri has tinkered only sparingly this season and Okazaki, starting instead of Jamie Vardy, was one of only two changes the manager made to the side who had edged closer to the Champions League knockout stages by beating FC Copenhagen on Tuesday. In the other change Ahmed Musa started in place of Marc Albrighton. Both alterations made a big difference.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Shinji Okazaki tears off with Islam Slimani in pursuit after scoring Leicester’s second. Photograph: Plumb Images/Leicester City FC via Getty Imag\n\nMusa started and finished the game’s breakthrough move. He cut in from the left wing and fizzed the ball to Islam Slimani. The Algerian and Okazaki then outmuscled Palace’s defenders to prolong the move and tee up Musa for a shot from the edge of the area. Kelly could have blocked it but was so distracted by the lurking Mahrez, who tormented him for most of the match, he merely watched the Nigerian lash a shot past Mandanda. It was Musa’s first goal since joining from CSKA Moscow in the summer.\n\nThe storming of Palace continued after the break. Slimani almost scored with a diving header from a cross by Mahrez but his effort flew into the side netting. The brazen swagger with which Palace had attacked in the early stages had long since been replaced by defensive scrambling and they were lucky Okazaki reprieved them in the 58th minute with a bungled header after another cross from Mahrez.\n\nHe made amends moments later when he thrashed a low shot into the net from the edge of the area after a desperate attempted clearance by Damien Delaney.\n\nSwansea earn Bob Bradley first point as manager in dour draw with Watford Read more\n\nPalace, though overrun, did not prostrate themselves in front of the champions. Yohan Cabaye signalled their defiance with a close-range stab at goal but was thwarted by Kasper Schmeichel. Danny Simpson had to clear a header from Benteke off the line.\n\nBenteke was busy at both ends and, moments later, thought he had done a useful job when he headed away a corner by Mahrez but Christian Fuchs ran on to the bouncing ball and walloped a splendid half-volley into the net from 25 yards. The Austrian’s first goal for the club came the day after he signed a three-year deal. “I’m very angry with him because he has this quality but he needed a new contract to score a goal!” Ranieri said, jokingly.\n\nFive minutes from time Cabaye flicked a cross by Wilfried Zaha into the net.

wardrobe change, yet the transformation on the pitch under the new manager will have to wait after Swansea City’s winless run stretched to eight matches. There were positives for the American to take, notably the performance of Modou Barrow and the sight of Alfie Mawson playing so well on his Premier League debut, yet the harsh reality is that this was two points dropped.\n\nWithout a victory since the opening day, Swansea remain in the relegation zone, second from bottom and with a tricky run of fixtures to come, starting with a trip to Stoke on Monday week. A win in Bradley’s first home game in charge would have lifted some of the gloom and it so nearly arrived during a second half when Barrow tormented Watford with his pace and trickery, Gylfi Sigurdsson hit the upright and Heurelho Gomes denied Mike Van der Hoorn from point-blank range.\n\nClinical Burnley edge out Everton with Scott Arfield’s last-minute winner Read more\n\nIt was that sort of day for Swansea at the end of a very difficult week, during which the club’s supporters’ trust voiced their unhappiness that Huw Cooze, their elected director on the board, was not notified by the owners of the decision to replace Francesco Guidolin with Bradley.\n\nIn the match programme, Jason Levien and Steve Kaplan, who bought a majority stake in Swansea in the summer, apologised for their actions. “Not informing him sooner as to our ultimate choice was an error on our part and for which we take full responsibility,” they wrote.\n\nBradley, in fairness, received a warm ovation from the Swansea fans before the match. He also showed that he is not afraid to ruffle a few feathers among the players when he made five chances to the team, including dropping both centre-backs, Jordi Amat and Federico Fernández.\n\nWhether Bradley can find firepower in this team, however, is another matter, with the lack of confidence in front of goal brutally exposed.\n\n“We have to trust the fact that if we work the right way, if our football gets better, if we compete better, if we do all these little things to improve, the points will come,” he said.\n\n“I’m disappointed. As we were going through the second half, there were a number of occasions where I thought: ‘Here it is.’ But when it doesn’t come, I don’t want to forget the things that for me were very positive.”\n\nMawson’s display was among them. Signed from Barnsley in the summer, the 22-year-old acquitted himself well alongside Van der Hoorn, who had arguably the best chance of the game when he stabbed Sigurdsson’s free-kick towards goal only for Gomes to block with his legs. Sigurdsson later shot tamely into the arms of the Watford keeper and swept a 20-yard effort on to the foot of the post – both opportunities arriving following excellent work from the lively Barrow.\n\nWatford, who are ninth in the table and on a decent run of form, seemed content to play on the counterattack, especially after the interval, and threatened only sporadically. Valon Behrami was aggrieved that Paul Tierney, the referee, failed to point to the spot when he went down under a challenge from Kyle Naughton – it looked more like a tangle of legs – and the substitute Nordin Amrabat snatched at a half-chance after breaking through in the inside-left channel.\n\nAs for Bradley, at least his attire was an improvement on the all-black outfit he wore at Arsenal. “I have to wait to see the reviews tomorrow,” he said, smiling. “I’m still trying to figure what out works over here.”"}, {"date": "22/10/2016", "arena": "London Stadium", "attendance":

box, and there was an inevitability about the cruel blow that came from Winston Reid’s left foot in the fourth minute of stoppage time. Having decided to settle for a point when a braver side might have sought to test West Ham United’s nerve in a stadium that still feels a little cold and alien, they ended up with nothing. Their air of resignation about their plight is becoming suffocating, a self-fulfilling prophesy that threatens to drag them into the Championship without so much as a whimper.\n\nAs the cliche goes, goals change games and Reid’s winner certainly altered the perception of a desperately poor game. If Sunderland had held out, David Moyes would have been able to praise their resilience or Lamine Koné’s fine performance in central defence. In that parallel universe, the visitors left east London with their heads held high, determined to build on a morale-boosting draw by giving Arsenal the game of their lives at the Stadium of Light next Saturday.\n\nInstead they departed stalked by the stench of doom and decay, the focus switching to a debate about whether they were punished for their negativity, with Moyes handing the initiative to West Ham by replacing two of his attacking players with defenders in the final 10 minutes. Slaven Bilic added another striker, Ashley Fletcher, to West Ham’s attack.\n\nIn trying to hold what they had, it was no surprise that the league’s bottom side proved so butterfingered. Although the pressure from West Ham could hardly be called relentless – for much of the second half the hosts attacked with all the sense of direction of a fly repeatedly zooming into a window – Reid’s goal leaves Sunderland with two points from their first nine matches, winless and witless.\n\nMoyes complained that Jonathan Calleri was standing in an offside position when the substitute let Reid’s shot run through his legs and past Jordan Pickford, but the flag stayed down.\n\nFrom West Ham’s perspective, this was a crucial victory after last Saturday’s restorative win over Crystal Palace. It lifted them three points clear of the bottom three and eased the pressure on Bilic, although he knew that his team failed to impress once again in the disorienting environment of their new ground.\n\nClinical Burnley edge out Everton with Scott Arfield’s last-minute winner Read more\n\nThey faded after starting brightly and there were plenty of moments when Sunderland wasted chances to expose their defensive flaws on the break.\n\nIn West Ham’s defence, they played some excellent football in the opening 20 minutes when Sunderland had the look of a side waiting for the punishment to begin. Bilic kept faith with the 3-4-2-1 system that worked so well at Selhurst Park with Edimilson Fernandes, a young Swiss midfielder, making his first league start in place of the suspended Aaron Cresswell on the left and Dimitri Payet and Manuel Lanzini kept popping up in dangerous positions. “We were really good,” Bilic said. “Just we didn’t score a goal.”\n\nPayet threatened on three occasions, curling wide after a neat exchange with Mark Noble, shooting too close to Pickford at the end of a brilliant dribble through the heart of the defence and hitting the base of the right post with an effort from 18 yards out.\n\nAn early goal would have extinguished the uncertainty that weighs West Ham down here, but their dip in intensity let Sunderland into the game. “We are still in a bit of cramp,” Bilic said, pointing to his head.\n\nLeicester back on track as Shinji Okazaki shines in win over Crystal Palace Read more\n\nFar too isolated throughout the first half, Jermain Defoe perked up. Jack Rodwell sent a header narrowly over and Wahbi Khazri squandered Sunderland’s best opening at the start of the second half, shooting insipidly at Adrián.\n\n“I did not enjoy the first part, but the second half we were not threatened and, if anything, we looked more likely to score,” Moyes said.\n\nYet Sunderland invited late pressure when Moyes brought on Paddy McNair and Billy Jones for Duncan Watmore and Khazri respectively, ceding territory and paying for it when a short corner routine ended with Payet finding Reid, who turned and hammered a low shot through the bodies from 18 yards out.

He must long to be part of what Jürgen Klopp has created at Anfield in his absence.\n\nOne year to the day since Klopp’s first home game as Liverpool manager his side moved level on points with Premier League leaders Arsenal courtesy of an unnecessarily hard-fought win over West Bromwich Albion.\n\nThe stadium announcer declared Liverpool top after the full-time whistle. A mistake but his excitement was understandable.\n\nLiverpool required victory by a two-goal margin to go top of the Premier League for the first time since May 2014 but another set-piece goal against put that ambition on hold. Another win is what counts and another impressive attacking display provided it, Sadio Mané and Philippe Coutinho scoring two excellent first-half goals before Gareth McAuley reduced the arrears and Liverpool’s league position.\n\n“Who wants to be on top in October?” said Klopp, exuding the calm assurance he will get there eventually. “That was a little bit of a joke. We have 20 points. It was not possible that we get any more tonight. When you play like this, it is really difficult to be kind of satisfied with football games. 2-1 keeps you more awake than 4-0.\n\n“Maybe we are not experienced enough in a situation like this to feel it could be easy. It is not easy. You need luck, the players fit. I have absolutely no problem with the goal we conceded. I would like to have it that nobody can score against us but first we have to have it that nobody can create chances. We have improved that.”\n\nLiverpool 2-1 West Brom: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nLiverpool overcame an assured Albion start and some wayward passing of their own to take a commanding lead at the interval. They were utterly dominant for the first 25 minutes of the second half too only for Tony Pulis’s side to haul themselves back into the contest and unnerve Anfield through McAuley’s goal.\n\nEven then Firmino and substitute Georginio Wijnaldum went close to restoring Liverpool’s two-goal advantage but, despite missing out on top spot, there was no blot on Klopp’s landscape. “In dreamland you always win four- or five-nil and the crowd can go earlier and people can do something more serious. But this game created one of the best atmospheres because it was exciting towards the end.”\n\nThe breakthrough left Klopp celebrating with right hand uppercuts in front of the main stand and stemmed from an innocuous source. The commanding Coutinho was about to receive a pass inside his own half from James Milner when, with an exquisite dummy, he took Darren Fletcher and Claudio Yacob out of the game and sent Emre Can into a dangerous attack.\n\n“They had runners and we didn’t want to let that happen,” said Pulis. Can released Firmino down the left, he floated an inch-perfect cross over the head of Allan Nyom and there was Mané to volley home his fourth goal of the season. It was another example of the collective threat that Klopp cherishes in his teams, as his manic reaction testified.\n\nCan was inches away from making it two when he stretched to meet Nathaniel Clyne’s inviting low cross from the right. The two-goal advantage that Liverpool sought was not long coming, however, as the visiting defence went into meltdown. Fletcher instigated the problems with an awkward back pass towards Ben Foster that his goalkeeper sliced skywards.\n\nJürgen Klopp would welcome Steven Gerrard having Liverpool role Read more\n\nThe former Manchester United midfielder was beaten by Can in the air as he attempted to clear up the mess and Mané set Coutinho free on the left. Liverpool’s No10 had plenty to do but, with another telling drop of the shoulder, he sent Craig Dawson and McAuley sliding out of the equation and drilled a fine finish inside Foster’s near post.\n\nFirmino, Dejan Lovren and Can all came close to a third in the second half, Foster denying the Brazilian and the Croat and Jonas Olsson thwarting the German international with a full body block.\n\nAlbion’s unlikely comeback should have started with 20 minutes to go but Nacer Chadli sliced horribly wide with the goal at his mercy from a Chris Brunt corner. Pulis’s introduction of Brunt and James Morrison eventually paid dividends as the visitors forced Liverpool back and, with nine minutes remaining, the Northern Ireland international’s corner dropped for McAuley to volley beyond Loris Karius at close range.\n\nLiverpool responded well and the merits of victory were not in dispute. “Their front five is as good as any in the league,” said the Albion manager. “With no Europe this year they have a free run at it. They’ve got a great chance this year.”"}, {"date": "17/10/2016", "arena": "Anfield", "attendance": 52769, "home_team": {"name": "Liverpool", "lineup": [{"name": "Loris Karius", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathaniel Clyne", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joel Matip", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dejan Lovren", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Milner", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [86]}, {"name": "Emre Can", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordan Henderson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Philippe Coutinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sadio Mané", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daniel Sturridge", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [60]}, {"name": "Roberto Firmino", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [85]}], "subs": [{"name": "Marko Grujic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ragnar Klavan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alberto Moreno", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [86], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Lallana", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [60], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lucas Leiva", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Simon Mignolet", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Divock Origi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [85], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Manchester United", "lineup": [{"name": "David De Gea", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Antonio Valencia", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eric Bailly", "yellows": [44], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Smalling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daley Blind", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ander Herrera", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marouane Fellaini", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marcus Rashford", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [77]}, {"name": "Paul Pogba", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Young", "yellows": [45], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Zlatan Ibrahimovic", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Marcos Rojo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Juan Mata", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wayne Rooney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [77], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jesse Lingard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Carrick", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sergio Romero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Luke Shaw", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "There was blood and thunder, as there always is in this fixture, but there was also a fair amount of thud and blunder. After all the hype – including a non-stop 12-hour build-up on one Norwegian channel – the latest meeting between these old rivals certainly fell short, no matter what it showed us about how the modern-day Manchester United are evolving and where Liverpool still need to improve.\n\nThis was not one of those occasions when José Mourinho could face allegations of unremitting negativity. His team did, however, play with the structure and organisational qualities that are automatically associated with their manager when it comes to category-A fixtures. This was a tough, obdurate performance from what Jürgen Klopp described as a “very physical, strong team” and it is difficult to know the last time a United side had as little as 35% possession in a Premier League match. That figure is the lowest since Opta began collating statistics in 2003 and that alone should guide United’s supporters about what they might have to expect occasionally under their new manager.\n\nManchester United’s Paul Pogba fails to live up to price tag in draw at Liverpool Read more\n\nMourinho seemed reasonably satisfied but, equally, he was exaggerating when he said United “controlled the game tactically and emotionally” and again when he mentioned David de Gea was “on holiday for nearly 90 minutes”. De Gea did not have a great deal to do but his night did incorporate one of the outstanding pieces of goalkeeping the Premier League will witness all season. His save from Philippe Coutinho – one-handed, at full length, in front of the Kop – left the Brazilian holding his head in disbelief and Klopp applauding on the touchline. “That is how he plays when he plays us,” Klopp noted afterwards of United’s goalkeeper. “Last year was similar. He loves games against Liverpool.”\n\nThat save can certainly be added to the list of occasions when De Gea has spared United over recent seasons but it was not the only occasion that made Klopp grimace afterwards and it needed a brilliantly executed tackle from Antonio Valencia to deny Roberto Firmino the possibility of a late winner.\n\nLiverpool 0-0 Manchester United: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nThese, however, were extraordinary moments in an otherwise ordinary match and if it was true, as Mourinho pithily observed, that Liverpool’s attack have been acclaimed as “the last wonder of the world”, this was not a night when that became apparent. Coutinho’s usual refinement was not always there. It was unusual to see Sadio Mané make such little impact and Daniel Sturridge was substituted after a difficult hour. Sturridge, to give him his due, came up against two resilient centre-backs in Eric Bailly and Chris Smalling and Klopp made the point afterwards that there was not a great deal of service for the striker.\n\nThe early pressure that might have been anticipated from the home side never really materialised and it quickly became apparent Liverpool were not going to have the freedom to dictate the tempo as they had in their previous Anfield fixtures. The game, Klopp noted afterwards, was played more in the way that United would have wanted than his own team. Everything can feel very rushed in these fixtures and sometimes it is not such a bad thing to have a player who puts his foot on the ball. “The game was very hectic,” Klopp said. “We couldn’t get rid of the hectic pace. When you have the ball you have to calm down, immediately. We wasted a lot of energy, for nothing really.”\n\nPlus this is a different United team to the ones we are used to seeing. “Physical-wise, they are stronger than we are,” Klopp said. Taller, too. Klopp also talked about knowing his team would need to guard against “a lot of high balls” once he saw the United line-up, with Wayne Rooney starting on the bench for the fourth successive match.\n\nIn the end, Liverpool can be satisfied with their first clean sheet of the season and though Mourinho called it a “very positive performance”, the truth is United created very little after an encouraging start in which Marcus Rashford looked lively and Zlatan Ibrahimovic seemed intent on playing a prominent role.\n\nUnited’s best opportunity came 10 minutes into the second half when Paul Pogba, playing in a slightly more advanced role than usual, eluded Jordan Henderson before crossing to the far post. Ibrahimovic had an awkward angle to negotiate but a striker with his reputation still ought to have done better with his headed chance.\n\nOtherwise, Liverpool were emerging as the more likely winners but even then, Henderson and Emre Can usually hung back rather than joining the team’s attackers. One exception almost led to the breakthrough when Joël Matip strode elegantly forward and played the first pass of the night to open up the United defence. It took an age before Can, surrounded by opponents, took aim and De Gea’s one-handed save, low to his right, was the first reminder of the goalkeeper’s brilliance.\n\nLiverpool and Manchester United fail to light up Anfield on drab evening Read more\n\nThe second, from Coutinho, had Anfield howling in anguish but Klopp’s praise for the opposition goalkeeper was mixed with criticism of his own players for not being telling enough with their passing. “We had 65% possession but you have to do more things with it,” he complained.\n\nInstead, the most positive aspect, perhaps, was that nobody could argue the referee Anthony Taylor’s performance was crucial to the result, despite all the scrutiny on the Altrincham-based official beforehand. Taylor made a few mistakes and was reasonable without being immaculate – but the same could be said of both teams on a strangely subdued night."}, {"date": "16/10/2016", "arena": "Riverside Stadium",

Their sole win came at Sunderland’s expense.\n\nAitor Karanka calls for response from Middlesbrough’s Ramírez and Negredo Read more\n\nKaranka blamed this latest setback on Watford’s ability to waste time – a black art apparently cultivated by their manager, Walter Mazzarri – but the visitors would not have been able to slow things down with such cute gamesmanship had Boro proved capable of stringing more than two consecutive passes together.\n\n“They made it impossible to play our game, it was impossible for us,” lamented Karanka before defending his hallmark 4-2-3-1 system which some observers feel is turning into a straitjacket for Boro’s players, partly explaining why they have not won at home since April.\n\n“We have a style,” the Spaniard countered. “I’ve built the squad to play that way, we won promotion with one up front. With that style we have a good chance. We have to keep going. It’s just October so we have a long time to go.”\n\nMazzarri affected to be taken aback by the time-wasting accusations. “I don’t know what he refers to,” he said. “Honestly, I don’t think so.” The Italian then reminded everyone that Boro’s Antonio Barragán should have been sent off for a second yellow-card offence in the first half. “We all know the rules and it was very evident. But I don’t comment on referees.”\n\nWithout a ball being kicked, the team-sheets alone created a measure of controversy. While Mazzarri preferred Isaac Success’s attacking potential to that of Odion Ighalo, Karanka recalled Negredo and Ramírez, leaving Jordan Rhodes and Viktor Fischer warming the bench.\n\nWhen Younès Kaboul – operating on the right of Watford’s back three – swiftly turned slapdash and conceded possession the former pair had a chance to show Boro fans what they were really capable of but, after exchanging passes with Negredo, Ramírez dragged a scuffed shot wide.\n\nWatford initially looked vulnerable but Boro’s problem was that Ramírez – deployed in the No10 position behind Negredo that is so key to Karanka’s configuration – seemed to have developed an unfortunate penchant for persistently picking the wrong pass. Even when he took a corner, the Uruguayan Ramírez overhit it, leaving the ball sailing out of play. Negredo was similarly off key but, in mitigation, that pair were hardly helped by Marten de Roon’s lack of control in a midfield anchoring role.\n\nSeeking a lucky break, Boro appealed for a handball penalty against Nordin Amrabat but, correctly, Roger East, the referee, refused to buy it and boos rang around a stadium studded with empty red seats.\n\nPep Guardiola builds on Barça past towards future at Manchester City | Sid Lowe Read more\n\nThe stay-aways quite possibly called it right. Although Watford improved as their formation gradually morphed from 3-4-3 to a defensive 5-4-1, the general standard was poor with far too many miscued passes and suspect first touches.\n\nIf Karanka had reason to be content with Calum Chambers’ and Ben Gibson’s containment of Troy Deeney, Boro’s manager must have been relieved that Barragán was not dismissed after committing that second bookable offence.\n\nAlready handed a yellow card for hauling down Success, the right-back was fortunate to escape a second for pulling back the same player 10 minutes later.\n\nIt seemed one of those afternoons when there would be more bookings than shots on target but Watford emphasised their efficiency by scoring with their first. Pouncing on a Boro clearance, Holebas took a steadying touch, before unleashing an elegant yet vicious 25-yard left-foot shot which defied the stretching Víctor Valdés en route to the top corner.\n\nAfter that it was all about Boro’s lack of a Plan B and Watford’s Italianesque determination to hold on to the win.\n\nPerhaps fortunately for Karanka, local anger was directed towards East. “We’ve had some shit refs but you are the worst,” they chorused after Holebas tripped Chambers on the edge of the area and no penalty was awarded. Replays showed the contact came fractionally outside the box.\n\nIndeed, the referee was the wrong target; arguably East’s only key mistake was not handing Barragán a red card for that second bookable offence and, wisely, Karanka refrained from criticising him. Right now a manager who surely delayed too long in liberating Rhodes from the bench has bigger things to worry about."}, {"date": "16/10/2016", "arena": " Mary's Stadium", "attendance": 29040,

and have had two promotions since then”, but that is gallows humour.\n\nSince leaving Burnley in 2013 Austin has scored four goals in four matches against his former club and his two strikes here helped to extend Southampton’s quiet progress under Claude Puel while condemning Burnley to another away defeat.\n\nAustin demonstrated his growing importance to Southampton by opening the scoring early in the second half and then adding a penalty.\n\nNathan Redmond, a wriggly menace all afternoon, interspersed that brace with a nice goal of his own before Sam Vokes scored a penalty to become the first player in seven matches to infiltrate Southampton’s exceptionally vigilant defence.\n\nPuel appeared unconvinced about Austin earlier in the season but the striker has forced his way to the forefront of his plans thanks to a scoring streak that now stands at seven goals in his last six matches. He and Southampton had so many chances here that they should have finished with an even bigger tally.\n\nDyche admitted that Southampton were the stronger side but argued with strong justification that pivotal penalty decisions went against his side.\n\nThe hosts would have taken the lead in the fifth minute if Austin had not been thwarted by a wonderful save by Tom Heaton. The chance was created by Matt Targett, who fired in a cross from the left. Austin applied a textbook downward header from six yards but Heaton responded by giving a lesson in top-class goalkeeping, plunging quickly to his left to push the ball around the post with a strong hand. Austin used his own hands to clasp his head in disbelief.\n\nHeaton is an England squad member and Dyche said the save was akin to the famous one that Gordon Banks made from Pelé in 1970 or Joe Hart’s against Slovenia last week. Heaton was required to give many more demonstrations of his ability before the end of the match.\n\nBurnley struggled to find any weakness in Southampton’s defence, even after Targett was forced off with a hamstring injury in the 14th minute. This was the third match of Andre Gray’s four-match suspension for online comments made long before he joined Burnley, who have been punished severely by his absence.\n\nThey had a grievance here when Virgil van Dijk brought an unceremonious end to a run into the box by Johann Gudmundsson. To Dyche’s dismay the referee, Mike Dean, waved play on and Southampton did exactly that, Dusan Tadic sweeping a fine pass into the path of Austin. Austin attempted a long-distance lob over the stranded Heaton but got it pitifully wrong, squirting a low shot wide.\n\nTadic was presented with an even better chance a couple of minutes later thanks to a mighty clearance by Fraser Forster. Heaton stood up as the forward bore down on him and then made a straightforward stop. Southampton tried to beat Heaton a couple of more times before the break but Redmond and Van Dijk were both foiled without fuss. Burnley’s satisfaction with their goalkeeper was offset by the loss of Steven Defour. The midfielder has become influential since being purchased from Anderlecht in August and was missed here after succumbing to a hamstring injury just before half-time.\n\nThat blow was compounded in the 52nd minute when Austin helped himself to a reward for his persistence. Van Dijk headed the ball across goal from a corner and it deflected off Jordy Clasie’s shoulder to Austin, who tried to hook it into the net from two yards. Vokes blocked it but Austin stabbed the rebound into the net. Austin could not conceal his joy, which was understandable in view of his earlier misses and the fact that his four-year old daughter, Ava, was watching from the stands for the first time.\n\nThe visitors’ lack of a cutting edge made a comeback unlikely. The possibility became even more remote eight minutes later, when Redmond doubled the hosts’ lead. It was a sweet finish by the forward, who lashed a low half-volley past several bodies and into the net from 16 yards following a corner.\n\nSix minutes later Sam McQueen, the 21-year-old who came on in place of Targett to make his Premier League debut, showed that while he may be inexperienced he is not without wiles, as he tumbled in the box following a gauche challenge by Gudmundsson. “Simulation, possibly, I believe it’s called,” Dyche said. Austin duped Heaton into diving one way and rolled the ball into the opposite corner.\n\nBurnley’s only consolation was that they scored their first away league goal of the season after José Fonte was adjudged to have illegally blocked a run by Ben Mee as Burnley delivered a corner. Vokes scored from the spot but Southampton’s victory never looked in danger."}, {"date": "15/10/2016", "arena": "Stamford Bridge", "attendance": 41547, "home_team": {"name": "Chelsea", "lineup": [{"name": "Thibaut Courtois", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "César Azpilicueta", "yellows": [51], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Luiz", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gary Cahill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Moses", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [80], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [82]}, {"name": "N'Golo Kanté", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nemanja Matic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marcos Alonso", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pedro", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [68]}, {"name": "Diego Costa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [7], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eden Hazard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [33], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [82]}], "subs": [{"name": "Asmir Begovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ruben Loftus-Cheek", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [82], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michy Batshuayi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Terry", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathaniel Chalobah", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [68], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Temitayo Olufisayo Olaoluwa Aina", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [82], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dominic Solanke", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Leicester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Kasper Schmeichel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Luis Hernández", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wes Morgan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robert Huth", "yellows": [27], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Fuchs", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jeffrey Schlupp", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [67]}, {"name": "Danny Drinkwater", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daniel Amartey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marc Albrighton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [74]}, {"name": "Ahmed Musa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [67]}, {"name": "Jamie Vardy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Andy King", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [74], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Simpson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Islam Slimani", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [67], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ron-Robert Zieler", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Demarai Gray", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leonardo Ulloa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Riyad Mahrez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [67], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "There was a moment just after the hour-mark here when frustration finally overcame Claudio Ranieri, prompting a comically exaggerated thumbs down as he spun on his heels in disgust on the edge of his technical area.

Maybe the prospect of having to heave themselves into another slog of a domestic campaign has diminished their hunger, particularly with the tantalising distraction of the Champions League. Perhaps they have just been found out. It cannot all be pinned on N’Golo Kanté’s departure to south-west London.\n\nA trio of first-choice players had admittedly been rested with one eye on Tuesday’s visit of Copenhagen, when victory would maintain progress at the top of their group and bring the knockout phase within sight, but that did not excuse the slackness of so much of this display.\n\nChelsea enjoyed a similar breeze against promoted Burnley back in August, the ease of their victory summed up by the substitute Nathaniel Chalobah’s neat backheel into Victor Moses’s pass 10 minutes from time that was finished emphatically by the right wing-back. Antonio Conte’s team have made a habit of dispatching teams outside the division’s elite this term. Leicester currently fall into that bracket.\n\nThe hosts had established their lead early, swarming all over limp opponents and swiftly exploiting a new-found fragility at set-pieces.

Luis Hernández, secured under freedom of contract in the summer, looked out of his depth at right-back, constantly bypassed by the interplay mustered by Marcos Alonso and Eden Hazard down the hosts’ left. Chelsea were irrepressible, but Leicester never hinted at resistance.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Leicester City’s Kasper Schmeichel fails to keep out Diego Costa’s opening goal.

The striker rammed in the seventh goal of a productive campaign from close range.\n\nIt was the kind of concession that would have been unthinkable only a few months ago, but it was the fifth goal shipped by this side at set-plays already this term.

The Belgian’s fortunate first touch took him away from Christian Fuchs and, having darted around Schmeichel, his finish was crisp and accurate.\n\nThrow in David Luiz’s free-kick, which thumped the top of the post, and the fact the visitors departed at the interval having been breached only twice actually felt a cause for moderate celebration.\n\nDismantling the reigning champions would normally serve as a statement of intent at Chelsea, though this was all too easy. They could rejoice in Kanté’s busy presence, his every touched booed by the travelling support, with the Frenchman denied his first goal for his new club by Morgan’s desperate block.

This was an historic occasion, with an American manager taking charge of a Premier League team for the first time. It was one that Bob Bradley will never forget, even if he and Swansea City came out on the wrong side of a five-goal thriller.\n\nEvery time that Arsenal looked to have taken a decisive grip, Bradley’s men rallied. First, Gylfi Sigurdsson cut a 2-0 deficit in half, towards the end of the first period and, on 66 minutes, the substitute Borja Bastón pulled it back to 3-2 with his first goal for Swansea, after his £15.5m summer move from Atlético Madrid.\n\nDele Alli strikes late to earn Tottenham draw at West Bromwich Albion Read more\n\nIt was an afternoon that Granit Xhaka would rather forget and the Arsenal midfielder was sent off for a cynical chop on the electric Modou Barrow, which left his team with 10 men for the final 20 minutes. Swansea ramped up the pressure and, during a gripping finale, Barrow and Sigurdsson missed gilt-edged chances.\n\nSwansea could not force the equaliser and it meant that the club had equalled their worst-ever start to a season. Bradley, though, could see positives, all of which were rooted in the sturdiness of his team’s approach and the overall sense of boldness.\n\n“Not one of us will walk out of here feeling good,” Bradley, who replaced Francesco Guidolin before the international break, said. “But we can build on that kind of mentality. It’s a start.”\n\nThis was a game that Arsenal might have won several times over. Theo Walcott scored two, missed a golden chance from close range and twice hit the woodwork. And yet there could be no mistaking the sense of relief from those with Arsenal in their hearts when it was over.\n\nXhaka was the player who made things more difficult for his team. The Switzerland international had been at fault for Sigurdsson’s goal, having tried to beat him in his own defensive third only to lose possession to him but it was his challenge on Barrow that turned the closing stages into an ordeal.\n\nBarrow had outstripped him but the Swansea winger was not in an overly dangerous position on the flank and Xhaka did not have to foul him. He clearly thought that he would take the yellow card and regroup but, to his horror, the referee, Jon Moss, brandished a straight red. Arsène Wenger described it as “harsh” and he complained that Barrow had “made a lot of it”. But he also promised to speak to Xhaka. “He has to learn from it,” the Arsenal manager said. “It was a dark yellow and the referee went for bright red.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mesut Özil volleys in the goal that eventually clinched Arsenal’s victory. Photograph: Nick Potts/PA\n\nBradley – an all-action presence in his technical area – used a 4-4-2 formation, with Sigurdsson and Leroy Fer as the starting strikers, but his team were undermined by defensive errors. Jordi Amat took a heavy touch following Héctor Bellerín’s headed cross and he was then levered off the subsequent chase for the ball by Walcott. Lukasz Fabianski was not convincing when he left his line and Walcott squeezed home.\n\nArsenal’s second came when Jack Cork stooped to head Santi Cazorla’s corner clear only for the ball to ricochet back to Walcott, who had the time to take a touch, spin and beat Fabianski. Shkodran Mustafi had earlier hit the top of the crossbar with a header while Alexis Sánchez and Bellerín had gone close.\n\nArsenal looked comfortable but Swansea refused to accept defeat. Sigurdsson’s finish was of the highest order – a curling left-footer into the far corner – and Amat spurned a decent headed opportunity to equalise in first-half stoppage time from Sigurdsson’s free-kick.\n\nJunior Stanislas runs riot in Bournemouth’s joy of six against Hull Read more\n\nWalcott fluffed a volley for his hat-trick before Özil decided to show him how it was done, from a much more difficult chance. Sánchez’s cross was looped high to the back post and Özil cut across the ball beautifully with his left foot to send it screaming into the roof of the net.\n\nBack came Swansea. Barrow laid on Bastón’s goal, after skinning Nacho Monreal, and Fer blasted high after Bellerín’s weak clearance. Swansea pushed after the red card but Barrow’s free header lacked power, Sigurdsson lifted over from Barrow’s cutback and Fer, twice, could not convert with headers.\n\nOn the counterattack, Walcott hit the post and, at the very end, the crossbar. Wenger would criticise his players for their lack of focus at 2-0 and 3-1 but they squeaked home.\n\nIt was a sixth straight victory in the league and Arsenal now sit joint-top of the table. “It was a comfortable afternoon that finished very uncomfortably,” Wenger said."}, {"date": "15/10/2016", "arena": "Vitality Stadium", "attendance": 11029, "home_team": {"name": "Bournemouth", "lineup":

leading his side’s recovery after his mistake had gifted Hull their goal. Cook gifted Hull possession then diverted Ryan Mason’s speculative drive past the wrong-footed Artur Boruc to let the visitors level at 1-1.\n\nCook headed home Junior Stanislas’s cross seven minutes later to cap a hectic 200th appearance for Bournemouth.\n\n“I always say when we make mistakes we make them together,” Howe said. “And when we make mistakes playing out from the back or building from deep positions I take responsibility because that’s how I ask them to play. So I never look to crucify an individual for making a mistake trying to do the right thing.\n\n“Steve’s been excellent for us this season, he’s really grown in his maturity and the consistency of his performances. And that was another sign of his maturity, the fact that he responded to the mistake by doing something positive and not letting it affect him.\n\n“The way we hit back after conceding that goal was the most pleasing thing. Of course we scored a number of goals and played very well, but the ability to bounce back from that setback was crucial. We had dominated the game and to find ourselves at 1-1 was very, very cruel. But the players didn’t let that disappointment linger and went and scored two more goals before half-time.\n\n“That two-goal cushion was very important. And the next one was key, either to bring them back into the game or end it, and thankfully we got it.”\n\nStanislas scored two with Charlie Daniels, Callum Wilson and Dan Gosling adding to Cook’s header as Bournemouth ran riot on the south coast. Stanislas stepped up to bury a penalty at the end of the first half and earn a 3-1 lead at the break, but Howe revealed he was not the designated spot-kick taker.\n\n“We always like the players to take responsibility; we had a designated penalty taker,” said Howe. “For whatever reason he didn’t want to take it, so that’s something we’ll look at.\n\n“I’m very pleased with the fact we were clinical in front of goal. We’ve won three in a row at home and that’s really pleasing because last season we struggled to win here. If you don’t win at home it means you put pressure on yourselves when you go away, and thankfully our away form last year was really strong.\n\n“Our goal at the moment is to improve on last season. We don’t want to get carried away. We’re enjoying the form we’re in, but we don’t want to get ahead of ourselves. So an improvement on last year will do us.”\n\nMike Phelan admitted the hefty defeat was a wake-up call that his side must heed or face the consequences of a relegation dogfight. Phelan challenged Hull to handle the hammering as a reality check after a start to the season that earned him the manager-of-the-month award for August and the full-time manager’s job on Thursday.\n\n“We’ve taken the plaudits of seven points from seven games,” he said. “Now we realise what it needs and the momentous hard work we have to do to stay at this level. We have to react to it. It’s something that we’re all responsible for. A reaction is exactly what you want.\n\n“The players and staff are hugely disappointed, because we weren’t the team that I thought we were.

They should have won this match, and would have done but for an outstanding performance from the Everton goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg, who saved two penalties and kept out two more goal-bound efforts from Sergio Agüero and Kevin De Bruyne. Apart from a third successive game without a win, Pep Guardiola will be concerned about his side’s penalty wastage rate – of eight spot-kicks awarded this season, they have converted only four – but mostly he will be worried that City are dominating games without making their superiority count. It is far too early in the season to suggest the former Barcelona manager is becoming desperate, but when, almost laughably, he sent on Vincent Kompany as a striker for the last few minutes it could only be interpreted as a sign of frustration.\n\nRonald Koeman delighted with Everton’s defence in Manchester City draw Read more\n\nGuardiola introduced a new formation for this game, three at the back and four across midfield, and when Leroy Sané marked his first league start by whisking past Bryan Oviedo in the opening minutes as if the defender was not there it looked as though City might be about to give Everton a football lesson.\n\nIt did not quite work out that way. When Stekelenburg dived to his left to keep out De Bruyne’s penalty a couple of minutes before the interval, it was just about the first save the goalkeeper had to make. There had been a routine stop from Raheem Sterling earlier in the game but that was typical of the home side’s first-half efforts.\n\nCity had virtually unlimited possession and moved the ball around swiftly and intelligently in attempting to swarm all over their opponents, only for a combination of tame finishing and dogged defending to allow Everton to reach the interval unscathed. Phil Jagielka and Ashley Williams deserve credit for a series of blocks on the six-yard line as the hosts kept trying to pass the ball into the net, but ultimately City had to reflect on a long period of dominance that brought no reward. With Agüero left on the bench following international duty Kelechi Iheanacho did not quite provide the cutting edge up front City were seeking and, though Everton could not complain about the penalty awarded when Jagielka left out a leg to trip David Silva, the manner in which De Bruyne placed his attempt at an easy height for the goalkeeper to reach seemed to sum up his side’s indecisiveness in front of goal.\n\nLeicester’s woes continue as Hazard, Costa and Moses fire Chelsea to victory Read more\n\nEverton could only have been pleased to turn round on level terms after spending almost all the first half on the ropes. With two tricky wingers in the side in Yannick Bolasie and Gerard Deulofeu they might have been expected to at least try to exploit the space behind City’s extremely notional wing-backs, though in fact they barely crossed the halfway line and never managed to send players forward in the sort of numbers to cause their opponents problems.\n\nThat seemed to change at the start of the second half, as if Ronald Koeman had asked his players to impose themselves more during the interval. Bolasie linked with Deulofeu for the latter to force Claudio Bravo’s first save of the afternoon, before a flick from Iheanacho brought a reaction stop from Stekelenburg at the other end. The Nigerian made way for Agüero shortly after that, and when Koeman sent on James McCarthy for Deulofeu at the same time it looked as though Everton were stiffening their midfield to hang on for a point. Nothing of the sort, as it turned out.\n\nA determined touch by Bolasie on halfway simultaneously took out a defender and turned a hopeful ball forward into an opportunity for Romelu Lukaku to run at an exposed Gaël Clichy. To say the striker accepted it gratefully would be an understatement. Lukaku devoured the opportunity, and Clichy with it, losing the defender and finding Bravo’s bottom corner with an alacrity that put the home side’s finishing to shame.\n\nLionel Messi scores on return in easy Barcelona win over Deportivo La Coruña Read more\n\nThings did not get any better for City when yet another penalty was squandered, this time by Agüero. Jagielka was again the culprit, and it appeared Everton’s lead might last a mere five minutes until Stekelenburg pulled off another impressive stop, proving equal to Agüero’s shot despite the striker’s effort to put him off with a stuttering run-up.\n\nWhen Stekelenburg followed that with a fine save from Agüero from open play he put himself in the running for man of the match and kept Everton on course for an unlikely victory, though of course it could not last. Guardiola’s response to the second penalty miss had been to replace a fading Sané with a fresh Nolito, and within two minutes the substitute put City level, heading home from the six-yard line from Silva’s clever cross.\n\nThere was still time for Stekelenburg to rescue Everton again by getting fingertips to a tremendous shot from De Bruyne, though even with Kompany sent into the mixer the visiting defence clung on for a deserved point."}, {"date": "15/10/2016", "arena": "Bet365 Stadium", "attendance": 27701, "home_team": {"name": "Stoke City", "lineup": [{"name": "Lee Grant",

where the ball is going to land was evident for everyone to see. In midfield or out wide or wherever the ball was dropping, he anticipates really well. So if you can get him anticipating things in the box he’s going to get on the end of things and that’s what’s happening at the moment.\n\n“We’re delighted with what he’s producing.

something from what looked like being a damaging afternoon for Mauricio Pochettino and his players, yet the point that Dele Alli rescued in the 89th minute came at a cost. Toby Alderweireld, who has been so outstanding for Spurs since joining last year, was taken off on a stretcher early in the second half in considerable pain and with a potentially serious injury.\n\nMesut Özil scores winner as 10-man Arsenal go second with Swansea win Read more\n\nThe day then went from bad to worse for Spurs when Nacer Chadli scored against his former club in the 82nd minute, firing into the roof of the net from six yards. While Chadli’s celebration was restrained to say the least, it was tempting to wonder what was going through Pochettino’s mind as the Belgian was mobbed by his West Brom team-mates. It was Chadli’s fourth Premier League goal in five matches since swapping Spurs for Albion in August.\n\nTottenham, however, were not finished and their unbeaten Premier League record remains intact courtesy of Alli’s predatory goal. It was a rather different blow to the one the England international landed against Albion in April, when he punched Claudio Yacob in the stomach and was given a retrospective three-match suspension.\n\nAs much as Alli’s equaliser provided Spurs with some late encouragement, there was no escaping the concern about Alderweireld’s injury. He was in agony as he called for treatment and Pochettino was unable to shed much light on what happened, other than to say that the central defender remained in a lot of discomfort.\n\nPochettino confirmed Alderweireld has no chance of featuring against Bayer Leverkusen on Tuesday in the Champions League – Eric Dier came off the bench and took over at centre-back here and may well continue in that role.\n\n“We need to wait a little bit, 24-48 hours,” Pochettino said. “He got a heavy knock on his leg and we will see what happens. Now it is very painful and we don’t know what the problem is. We need to assess it tomorrow, scan it if that is what the doctor wants to do, to be clear what happened.\n\n“I asked Toby how he was, he said he was in a lot of pain. It’s a big area – the knee, the leg, all of it.”\n\nWith Alli’s goal arriving in the closing stages, it was hard to decide whether this was a point gained or two dropped for Spurs. Their travelling supporters will probably argue the latter, given the way Spurs dominated the first half, when only the combination of an outstanding display by Ben Foster and some profligate finishing kept the game goalless. The keeper made at least four decent saves in that period, including denying Alli in a one-on-one and thwarting Christian Eriksen with a superb one-handed stop.\n\nAlbion had 22% possession during that period and effectively put 10 men behind the ball, leaving Salomón Rondón to forage alone up front while the rest of the team sat deep and tried to frustrate a Spurs side that were set up in the same 4-1-4-1 formation that they used against Manchester City.\n\nTony Pulis acknowledged that his side were heavily indebted to Foster for the point. “If you look at the whole game we have Ben to thank,” the West Brom manager said. “We looked as if half a dozen were still away on international duty.\n\n“Spurs changed and played in a different way and stretched us. We managed to work it out in the second half and gave them a better game.”\n\nSpurs certainly lost their way a little after the break, with Albion more prepared to commit players forward. Even so, it was a surprise when Albion scored. Chris Brunt, who was making his first appearance since February, delivered a corner that ran through to James McClean. With the help of the post, Hugo Lloris managed to keep out the Irishman’s shot, but Chadli lifted home the loose ball.\n\nTottenham were suddenly staring at a defeat, but just before the end of normal time Eriksen’s shot was blocked and Alli was perfectly placed to slot past Foster, atoning for his earlier miss. “It’s true that we can talk about the need to be more clinical but the team played very well in the first half,” Pochettino said. “I was disappointed with the way we conceded the goal, but we showed character in the end.”"}, {"date": "15/10/2016", "arena": "Selhurst Park", "attendance":

been so conspicuous by its absence until now. For Slaven Bilic, who has been under such intense scrutiny in recent weeks, this was the sweetest of victories. West Ham’s manager took delight in his side’s slick football in the first half, the result of his carefully-plotted tactical plan, and later in the way they withstood a late storm of pressure from Crystal Palace, who rued Christian Benteke’s comical missed penalty.\n\nAll the ingredients were there for a late collapse: horrible conditions, a hotly contested red card, the challenge of holding their nerve in an increasingly hostile atmosphere. Yet Manuel Lanzini provided the spark for West Ham’s first league victory since 21 August, lifting them out of the bottom three, after a desperate two months and ending Palace’s five-match unbeaten run in the process. The visitors answered some questions about their character by surviving Martin Atkinson’s highly questionable decision to dismiss Aaron Cresswell for two yellow cards, their togetherness during that frenzied backs-to-the-wall effort in the dying stages an indication these players are still behind Bilic.\n\nCrystal Palace v West Ham United: Premier League – live! Read more\n\nWest Ham will certainly miss Cresswell against Sunderland on Saturday. Making his first appearance of the season after recovering from a serious knee injury, he was superb until Atkinson’s late intervention and made Lanzini’s goal. The left-back’s return allowed Bilic to use the 3-4-2-1 formation which laid the foundations for the 1-0 victory over Tottenham Hotspur in March, with Cresswell and Michail Antonio lining up as wing-backs and Cheikhou Kouyaté dropping into the back three alongside Angelo Ogbonna and Winston Reid.\n\nAlthough the rejig had the potential to play into Palace’s hands, given the threat posed by Pardew’s side on the flanks, it was certainly worth a try. West Ham had failed to pick up a point from their first three away matches of the season but with Dimitri Payet and Lanzini elusive in free roles, that enabled them to focus on creating rather than defending, there was an early glimpse of the benefits of West Ham’s altered shape when Cresswell fired just wide.\n\nOther than an early effort from Wilfried Zaha, the conclusion at the end of the first half was that Bilic had outwitted Pardew and the first disgruntled sounds could be heard in the home end in the moments before the goal. Confused by West Ham’s shape and unsure of who they were supposed to pick up, Palace stood off Payet on the left. He found Cresswell and Lanzini guided his fizzed low cross into the far corner, having gained a yard on James McArthur.\n\nPalace were making it awkward for themselves, misplacing passes and reacting slowly to loose balls. “I expect a little bit more aggression on the pitch,” Pardew said. “That was a crucial period, that first 20 minutes. We gave them a little gee-up.”\n\nPalace’s insipid start was one part of the story. West Ham’s work rate restricted Zaha and Andros Townsend from causing problems in the wide areas, with the energetic Kouyaté supporting Antonio on the right, Pedro Obiang outstanding in his screening role and Simone Zaza tireless up front. “It’s always the players, who tonight showed everything,” Bilic said. “Cresswell’s return gave us the opportunity to change the system. But it is about how we were running from the first whistle, how we were focused until the end.”\n\nMesut Özil scores clincher as 10-man Arsenal go second with Swansea win Read more\n\nPalace’s difficulties were encapsulated by Benteke’s woeful penalty on the stroke of half-time. Tripped by Ogbonna – replays suggested that the foul occurred outside the area – Benteke spooned his effort high and wide despite sending Adrián the wrong way. A Benteke header grazed the right post moments later but Pardew was not fooled by that brief resurgence, bringing on Zeki Fryers and Yohan Cabaye for Martin Kelly and Joe Ledley at half-time. Connor Wickham would soon join Benteke in attack.\n\nPayet had a chance to double the lead, only to shoot too near Steve Mandanda, but the mood changed after Cresswell’s early exit. Booked for diving when Cabaye appeared to catch him in the area, he received a second yellow card after a tangle with Zaha, who went down too easily. Pardew called the decision harsh. “It’s simply not a yellow card,” Bilic said.\n\nDespite incessant pressure from Palace, however, West Ham’s makeshift defence held firm. Adrián’s stunning late save from Wickham’s header summed up their defiance."}, {"date": "02/10/2016", "arena": "Old Trafford", "attendance": 75251, "home_team": {"name": "Manchester United", "lineup":

Frenchman appeared to have secured an invaluable win after a double José Mourinho substitution that led directly to his opener.\n\nSixty-seven minutes had gone when Juan Mata and Jesse Lingard came off for Wayne Rooney and Martial. Two more were played before the No11 gave United the lead and this initiated a flurry of opportunities. But they failed to score and up popped Joe Allen for the equaliser which came after David de Gea fluffed Glen Johnson’s shot. Jonathan Walters turned the ball on to the bar and the Welshman made no mistake.\n\nMourinho acted instantly, throwing on Memphis Depay for Ander Herrera and United went close in a frantic finish that had Pogba thumping the bar with an effort that came off his shoulder but Stoke clung on.\n\nMourinho claimed that Mark Hughes’s team should have suffered a hiding. “We should be not just with the three points but a fat result. It should have been 3-0 or 4-0 at half-time, six or seven at the end. But the result is 1-1. Very undeserved but a much better performance than against Leicester,” he said of the 4-1 win last week.\n\nAsked about the profligacy, the Portuguese said: “I never criticise my players for missing chances. The goalkeeper is the man of the match and deservedly. We had some open chances where we could [do] better but I am never critical of my players. I can be critical of the no quality of the performance, the naive mistakes sometimes but not in front of the goal.”\n\nHe would admit vexation at the result. “When the result should be 5-0 or 6-0 and it is 1-0 then happiness disappears and the frustration with the result comes. I think this was our best performance in the football we played – the creation, chances, the consistency because we did that for 90 minutes. We start in the first minute with a big chance and we finish in the last minute with another one and in between we had four, five, six, seven.\n\n“We had complete control of the game, a great attitude after the 1-0. We kept creating chances and then by magic they crossed the midfield line and scored a goal which is very unfair for us.”\n\nWithin seconds of kick-off Zlatan Ibrahimovic was the first to spurn a simple chance. Pogba dribbled, put the Swede through, Lee Grant’s goal gaped and all the No9 required was the kind of finish that has built his reputation. Instead he allowed the save and from the corner Stoke cleared.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Joe Allen pokes the ball past Antonio Valencia for Stoke’s equaliser. Photograph: Carl Recine/Reuters\n\nLater, a slick Potters sequence splayed United but Geoff Cameron was unable to score. Xherdan Shaqiri’s back-heel released Allen who pinged the ball towards Wilfried Bony. It came to Cameron but the shot was regulation for De Gea.\n\nNow United did better via a four-man play. Antonio Valencia passed to Mata who recycled to Ibrahimovic and his flick found Lingard. The winger delivered to Pogba but he missed the target.\n\nMata was again playing at No10 in place of Rooney and showing why. From what seemed a blind alley the Spaniard created an opening and came close to chipping Grant. The keeper tipped the ball over and when Daley Blind’s subsequent corner dropped on Pogba’s head, he should have scored.\n\nIt was the contest in microcosm for United. They dominated, they created, they could not capitalise. Two further examples involved Ibrahimovic and Lingard. Chance A came from a run and cross from the Swede from which Lingard forced a Grant save. Chance B was a reversal in which Lingard ran along the right and put the ball in for Ibrahimovic, but he could not score.\n\nMore of the same followed in the second half. Ibrahimovic cut through the middle but the move broke down. Lingard skated along his flank and crossed and Pogba’s effort went for a corner.\n\nManchester United 1-1 Stoke City: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nThe endeavour had Mourinho clapping but he now saw his side slashed open by Stoke. The ball went Shaqiri-Marko Arnautovic-Allen in a triangle that left the Welshman behind United’s lines with only De Gea to beat. The shot was yet another simple one to collect.\n\nHerrera was fortunate to be only booked for a studs-high tackle above Allen’s knee. The Stoke player said: “Sometimes they get sent, off sometimes they don’t.”\n\nAfter a stodgy phase of play Mourinho made his move and on came Rooney and Martial. It worked instantly. Martial zipped along his corridor and turned the ball into Rooney. He dawdled and while this allowed Cameron to dispossess him the ball was stabbed back to Martial who banged his shot past Grant for the opener, which was also his first goal of the season.\n\nThis prompted United’s late onslaught as Rooney just missed a cross, Blind had an attempt blocked and Ibrahimovic a shot saved. Now, though, came a Stoke fightback that left Hughes contented.\n\n“We showed we are a good side at this level,” he said, though they are still one off the bottom."}, {"date": "02/10/2016", "arena":

at home in the league for more than a year but Claudio Ranieri admitted Southampton should have ended that record here. The visitors forged several opportunities to take maximum points from the King Power Stadium but had to settle for only one because of their slovenly finishing and good saves by Kasper Schmeichel.\n\n“I’m very happy because I recognise Southampton played better than us and they deserved to win,” Ranieri said. “We created some good chances but they created more than us. Schmeichel made some two or three great saves, they hit the post. They made mistakes, fortunately. But for us it’s OK: one point and clean sheet.”\n\nLeicester did not play with the solidity of champions. They were uncertain and vulnerable. They may also have been jaded as this was their seventh match in 23 days and all but one of their starting lineup had begun the Champions League victory against Porto on Tuesday. Ranieri suggested he should have tinkered more and may do so as the season progresses, European competition being a beautiful chore that his team did not have to do last season.\n\nSouthampton, who made seven changes to the side who drew in Israel in the Europa League on Thursday, displayed more fluency and quality than their hosts, except when it came to finishing.\n\nAhmed Musa: I want to give something to people back home in Nigeria Read more\n\nCharlie Austin, hoping to impress the watching Gareth Southgate before he unveils his first England squad, had an early chance to claim his sixth goal in five matches but headed straight at Schmeichel. Three minutes later the striker nodded wide from a cross by Dusan Tadic. Austin went much closer in the 15th minute, running on to a delightful chip by Steven Davis before firing a shot past Schmeichel from an acute angle. To the striker’s despair the ball bounced out off the far post.\n\nLeicester, outnumbered and outmuscled in central midfield, were reliant on Riyad Mahrez for creativity but despite a couple of teasing runs,the Algerian was unable to help make a breakthrough. Instead Virgil van Dijk became an unwitting assistant, the normally infallible Dutchman teeing up Jamie Vardy by leaving a back pass short in the 29th minute. Oriol Romeu rescued the visitors by making a remarkable triple block, first foiling Vardy after Fraser Forster forced the striker wide, then stopping Islam Slimani’s follow-up shot before getting in the way of a second attempt by Vardy.\n\nRomeu, with Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, was running midfield in a way that may have had the home fans reminiscing about N’Golo Kanté but he almost sullied his brilliance by playing a slack pass to Slimani. This time José Fonte came to the rescue.\n\nSouthampton remained the more inventive in the second half. Davis had a shot from 18 yards deflected over by Daniel Amartey on the hour. Two minutes later the Northern Irishman slipped a ball through to Nathan Redmond, who confirmed that finishing is an art that he has yet to master by shooting weakly at Schmeichel.\n\nAustin, by contrast, is normally an expert finisher but here he erred. Davis made a chance for him to open the scoring in the 66th minute but, after shrugging off Christian Fuchs, Austin did not get the right weight on an attempted lob, which Schmeichel saved well after dashing off the line.\n\nIt was not one-way traffic, even though Southampton were making most of the chances. Danny Drinkwater gave a reminder the home side were still well in the game by stinging Forster’s hands with a drive from 25 yards.\n\nRanieri replaced his front players towards the end. Shinji Okazaki, introduced instead of Vardy, made his presence felt immediately, heading just wide.\n\nSouthampton’s substitutes should have made an even bigger impact. Two of them, Shane Long and James Ward-Prowse, undid the home defence in the 83rd minute, only for Ward-Prowse to waft a shot over from 14 yards."}, {"date": "02/10/2016", "arena": "White Hart Lane", "attendance": 31793, "home_team": {"name": "Tottenham Hotspur", "lineup": [{"name": "Hugo Lloris", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Walker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Toby Alderweireld", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jan Vertonghen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Rose", "yellows": [42], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Wanyama", "yellows": [30], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Moussa Sissoko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [72]}, {"name": "Christian Eriksen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dele Alli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [37], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [86]}, {"name": "Erik Lamela", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [65], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Heung-Min Son", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}], "subs": [{"name": "Vincent Janssen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michel Vorm", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Georges-Kevin N'Koudou", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [86], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eric Dier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [72], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kieran Trippier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Winks", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Davies", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Manchester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Claudio Bravo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pablo Zabaleta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nicolás Otamendi", "yellows": [20], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Stones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aleksandar Kolarov", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [9], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fernando", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [53]}, {"name": "Fernandinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jesus Navas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [65]}, {"name": "David Silva", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Raheem Sterling", "yellows": [56], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [87]}, {"name": "Sergio Agüero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Bacary Sagna", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "IIkay Gündogan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [53], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willy Caballero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leroy Sané", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [87], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gael Clichy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kelechi Iheanacho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [65], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aleix García Serrano", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "It was a performance of furious intensity and one that served to make the most eloquent of statements. Tottenham Hotspur mean business and, after their near miss last season, they are once again shaping up as serious contenders for the Premier League title.\n\nManchester City had arrived in north London with the perfect domestic record. They departed having been well beaten, knocked from their cultured rhythms by the blood-and-thunder basics that Mauricio Pochettino demands.\n\nLaurent Koscielny’s debatable Arsenal winner breaks Burnley at the last Read more\n\nTottenham brought the class, too. The most eye-catching players wore white and Dele Alli, Son Heung-min and Victor Wanyama vied for the man-of-the-match award. Alli scored Tottenham’s second goal and he dazzled with his quicksilver incisions while Son was a persistent threat in the No9 role. Wanyama offered the platform upon which Tottenham played.\n\nThe home team could even afford to miss a second-half penalty through Erik Lamela and, by the end, the White Hart Lane crowd was serenading Pochettino about him being magic. It was Pochettino’s triumph, as much as anybody else’s and, although he would not say so, it was surely made all the sweeter by it coming against Pep Guardiola – his rival from the days when they were in opposition as players, then managers, at Espanyol and Barcelona, respectively.\n\nPochettino’s first game as a manager had been against Guardiola’s great Barcelona team in 2009 and he had told the story on Friday about how he had instructed his players to press high and hard – and be fearless. Espanyol would draw 0-0.\n\nThis was another classic Pochettino performance and City had no answers. At times, as Tottenham’s players swarmed into their faces, the visitors looked extremely uncomfortable. Time on the ball was at a premium. City struggled to break Tottenham’s high press, although when they did they had their moments – mainly through Sergio Agüero. But it was an afternoon when, try as he might, he could not find a way past Hugo Lloris.\n\nSouthampton rue missed chances in stalemate at Leicester Read more\n\nPochettino’s team took the lead early on, and what a horror story it was for Aleksandar Kolarov. Danny Rose’s cross from the left was flighted into the danger area but there were no Tottenham players close to it and Kolarov ought to have known that there was nobody coming in behind him, either. He did not, and his decision to attempt a volleyed clearance resulted in an ugly slice, which sent the ball spinning into his own net, off the underside of the crossbar.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Aleksandar Kolarov reacts after his own goal gave Tottenham an early lead. Photograph: Martin Dalton/REX/Shutterstock\n\nCity might have led at the outset when Jesús Navas crossed from the right and David Silva could not apply the decisive touch. But Tottenham looked hungrier and, with Wanyama setting the tone, they won the battle for midfield control. It was easy to marvel at their aggression and physicality, and Guardiola was left to lament how City could not build up the play or win the second balls. “Tottenham were the better team,” Guardiola said. “We can just say congratulations to them.”\n\nSon started up front, Pochettino preferring his mobility to the more traditional virtues of Vincent Janssen, and the South Korean unnerved City with his direct running. He laid on Alli’s goal, after an initial Tottenham break had run into Pablo Zabaleta. The weight of Son’s pass was perfect and Alli rammed a low shot past Claudio Bravo. It was remarkable to think that Son had not played at centre-forward since his days at Hamburg. His hold-up work was also first-class.\n\nSon had worked Bravo at his near post in the 11th minute while Christian Eriksen thumped inches wide with a free-kick after Nicolás Otamendi had been booked for a foul on Alli. Otamendi skated on thin ice. He had earlier escaped censure for a deliberate handball and Pochettino argued with the fourth official that he should have been given a second yellow card for another foul on Alli in the 35th minute.\n\nBravo looked anything but secure, particularly with the ball at his feet, and the home crowd jeered him whenever he went near to it. Guardiola wants the goalkeeper to be an additional outfield player – the first passer from the back – but some of his decision-making was risky and it invited Tottenham pressure.\n\nAgüero was City’s most obvious threat, as he so often is against Tottenham, and he extended Lloris with a free-kick midway through the first half. Shortly after the interval, from Fernandinho’s pass, the striker saw a shot diverted by Lloris on to the near post and away.\n\nGuardiola had sent his players out for the second half well before those of Spurs, which seemed to speak volumes and he made tweaks to his team, including sending on the striker, Kelechi Iheanacho, in the 65th minute and switching to a 4-4-2 diamond formation. But Tottenham were comfortable and, after Son and Wanyama had gone close, they ought to have added to their lead.\n\nAlli picked his way into the City area again and, when he was clipped by Fernandinho, the referee, Andre Marriner, was compelled to point to the penalty spot. Lamela grabbed the ball and he resisted Son’s attempts to snatch it from him. In those circumstances, the player has to score but Lamela’s kick was too close to Bravo, who beat it away.\n\nCity sought the goal that might have levered them back into the contest but Iheanacho had a shot saved by Lloris and Agüero watched a late effort deflect and fly towards the roof of the net.

Read more\n\nIt was the third minute of stoppage time, and the cruellest of circumstances for this tough, obdurate Burnley side, when Arsenal’s possession finally paid off and the seemingly endless 20th-anniversary commemorations for Arsène Wenger were given a shot of euphoria that had not seemed like coming. The game’s late, decisive moment was contentious, to say the least, and once again English football was given a reminder that perhaps it is time for the introduction of video technology, a debate that seems to have been going on for every bit as long as Wenger has been at Arsenal.\n\nNaturally, Wenger did not see it, to add to the already bulging file of other controversies he has missed over the past two decades. He did, however, accept that Arsenal’s fifth successive Premier League win might have been accompanied by a hefty amount of good fortune. For starters, the electronic board had signalled two minutes of stoppage time but the real issue came from the fact the ball ricocheted in off Laurent Koscielny’s arm. Koscielny had actually kicked it against himself but his close-range shot was going wide until it diverted off the scorer’s elbow.\n\nThe only possible mitigation for the referee, Craig Pawson, was that everything happened so quickly and that, to give him the benefit of the doubt, perhaps he did not have an entirely clear view in a congested penalty area. All the same the Burnley manager, Sean Dyche, was being careful with his words when he said the official might have a “tough night” reflecting on his part in the late drama.\n\n“It’s hard not to be frustrated when something is taken away from you that is in the hands of the referee,” Dyche said. “Our analyst tells me it was six or seven seconds over [the allotted time] when it went in. That doesn’t sound a lot, but it is in this case. And it’s a handball goal. You’re frustrated when you lose any goal but particularly one like that.”\n\nWenger was still probably entitled to think his team had enough of the ball to warrant the victory. Equally, the Arsenal manager accepted it was a laboured performance riddled with “technical mistakes”. Arsenal did at least conform to the adage that all teams with realistic title ambitions need to know how to win when playing badly. But it was not easy to watch this performance and find a plausible argument that Arsenal have fixed the flaws that have left them short since their last championship 12 years ago.\n\n“It was the kind of game we could have won 1-0 or lost 1-0,” Wenger said. “Burnley make everyone suffer here.”\n\nThis was certainly several notches down from the performance with which Wenger’s team won 3-0 against Chelsea the previous weekend. Arsenal might have been the more cultured side but they looked surprisingly devoid of wit or imagination on the ball and, for all their possession, it was strange to see an attacking quartet featuring Alexis Sánchez, Mesut Özil, Theo Walcott and Alex Iwobi create so little. Burnley, playing with great resilience and togetherness, demonstrated why they had conceded only five goals in their previous 17 league games at Turf Moor and Michael Keane was outstanding in the heart of their defence.\n\nWenger was clearly frustrated by the manner in which Walcott, Iwobi and, most surprisingly, Özil did not show a great deal of poise when Arsenal were in encouraging positions. Iwobi, patrolling the space on the left-wing where Sánchez would usually be found, had a particularly difficult afternoon, encapsulated by his attempt to pick out the top corner of Tom Heaton’s net early in the second half. His shot sliced all the way across the pitch and went out for a throw-in close to the corner flag. Sánchez was playing through the middle and did at least threaten with a couple of second-half efforts, one saved by Tom Heaton and the other going narrowly wide. He is not, however, an orthodox centre-forward and Arsenal missed Olivier Giroud’s ability to hold up the ball and play in team-mates.\n\nBurnley’s frustrations were exacerbated by the fact, as Wenger later put it, the home side “looked like they could score from every corner”. Keane turned one against the crossbar and Burnley will also reflect on another headed opportunity, this time for Johann Berg Gudmundsson, earlier in the second half.\n\nFor the most part, however, the home side were unashamed about their ploys of conservatism. “Burnley made life very difficult for us,” Wenger said. “They were organised in a very intelligent way.” Until, that is, the 93rd minute when Özil played a short corner to Sánchez. Walcott applied the first header before Koscielny and the substitute Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain went for the follow-up.\n\n“I was fuming because we took a short corner,” Wenger said. “We were at the end of the two minutes [stoppage time] so why not just play the corner over? I didn’t see the ball go in but I’ve been told we were fortunate.”"}, {"date": "01/10/2016", "arena": "The Liberty Stadium", "attendance": 20862, "home_team": {"name": "Swansea City", "lineup":

Liverpool manager made no attempt to sugarcoat a first-half performance that prompted the temperature to rise in the visitors’ dressing room at the interval.\n\nWhatever Klopp said at half-time – the German admitted he was “very angry” – it did the trick as Liverpool, who were unrecognisable from the team that toiled in the opening 45 minutes, turned this game on its head to condemn Swansea to a defeat that leaves Francesco Guidolin clinging to his job.\n\nJames Milner delivered the crucial blow six minutes from time with his fourth penalty of the season, after Roberto Firmino had equalised early in the second half, and from that point on it was tempting to wonder what was going through the minds of Steve Kaplan and Jason Levien, Swansea’s American owners, as well as Guidolin’s.\n\nKaplan and Levien had flown in to watch this match in a visit that had been planned for a while but which took on far greater significance amid the speculation about Guidolin’s future. Ryan Giggs and Bob Bradley are both on a shortlist as part of a managerial search that has not always been conducted behind closed doors.\n\nIn fairness to Guidolin, Swansea were excellent in the opening 45 minutes and the Italian, judging from the number of times that his name was chanted, still has the support of a sizeable number of the club’s supporters. Yet the harsh reality is that this was a fifth defeat in seven league games, with Swansea collecting only one point from a possible 18 since winning at Burnley on the opening day. Those are the sort of statistics to worry any Premier League owner, irrespective of the fact that Swansea have played extremely well in patches in their last two fixtures, against Manchester City and now Liverpool.\n\nWhile the visitors were much the better team after the interval, Swansea should have had more to show for their first-half efforts than Leroy Fer’s fourth goal of the season. Borja, the club’s £15.5m record signing, squandered two excellent chances, the second of which came after Fer had put Swansea ahead. Mike van der Hoorn could still have salvaged a point in injury-time but the central defender – the wrong man in the right place – sliced wide with the goal at his mercy.\n\nIt was some turnaround from Liverpool in the second half and strange to reconcile the team that dominated that period with the one that looked so out of sorts early on. Liverpool were so pedestrian in their build-up in the first 45 minutes and seemed to be taken by surprise when Swansea played them at their own game by pressing aggressively all over the pitch.\n\nTo compound things for Liverpool they lost Adam Lallana to a groin injury early on and Daniel Sturridge was booked for diving. Klopp talked afterwards about how he sensed that his players had lost their discipline and composure, right down to “moaning about decisions that were absolutely right”.\n\nBorja could, and should, have put Swansea ahead after five minutes but the Spaniard, who was totally unmarked as he got in between Joël Matip and Nathaniel Clyne, inexplicably headed over the bar from the edge of the six-yard box. It was a poor miss and there was another to come from the same player in the 26th minute, when he nodded Gylfi Sigurdsson’s free-kick wide of the post.\n\nBy that stage Swansea were ahead after Fer exposed a familiar weakness in Liverpool under Klopp. Sigurdsson’s deep corner kick was headed back across goal by Borja and Fer, via a slight touch from Van der Hoorn, stabbed over the line. It was the 16th set-piece goal Liverpool have conceded since Klopp took over as manager last October – only Swansea have shipped more in that period.\n\nThe second-half, however, was a different story. Liverpool took control of the game and it was no surprise when Firmino levelled. Jordan Henderson lofted the ball back into the area after Philippe Coutinho’s free-kick came back of the wall and Firmino, with the freedom of the penalty area as the Swansea defence pushed out, guided his header into the corner.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Roberto Firmino celebrates scoring the equaliser. Photograph: Julian Finney/Getty Images\n\nIt was now one-way traffic, with Swansea pinned back. Coutinho stroked a lovely effort from the edge of the area inches wide and Sadio Mané saw his shot deflected over the bar by Kyle Naughton’s superb challenge as Liverpool continued to press. Swansea looked like they might cling on but with the clock ticking down Àngel Rangel clumsily bundled into Firmino and Milner made no mistake from the spot. Then came Van der Hoorn’s awful late miss.\n\nWith that the game was up for Swansea and it remains to be seen if the same is true for Guidolin.\n\nSwansea City 1-2 Liverpool: Premier League – as it happened Read more"}, {"date": "01/10/2016", "arena": "KCOM Stadium", "attendance": 21257, "home_team": {"name": "Hull City", "lineup": [{"name": "David Marshall", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Meyler", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jake Livermore", "yellows": [42], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Curtis Davies", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andrew Robertson", "yellows": [79], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robert Snodgrass", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Markus Henriksen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [72]}, {"name": "Samuel Clucas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [81]}, {"name": "Ryan Mason", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adama Diomande", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [63]}, {"name": "Dieumerci Mbokani", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Harry Maguire", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Huddlestone", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [81], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Abel Hernandez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [72], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shaun Maloney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [63], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eldin Jakupovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Weir", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Will Keane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Chelsea", "lineup": [{"name": "Thibaut Courtois", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "César Azpilicueta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Luiz", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gary Cahill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Moses", "yellows": [35], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [85]}, {"name": "Nemanja Matic", "yellows": [41], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "N'Golo Kanté", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marcos Alonso", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willian", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [61], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [89]}, {"name": "Diego Costa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [67], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eden Hazard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [81]}], "subs": [{"name": "Asmir Begovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Branislav Ivanovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cesc Fàbregas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Oscar", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [81], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pedro", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [85], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michy Batshuayi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathaniel Chalobah", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [89], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "A first league win since August and finally some satisfaction for Antonio Conte. The Chelsea manager tinkered with his team and, although the performance was not a vintage one, his side eased to a comfortable victory here after goals from Willian and Diego Costa.\n\nConte was visited by Roman Abramovich three times in the week leading up to this match, when they discussed how to revive a flagging team, and although this result may not indicate a complete turnaround, at least it was a start.\n\nConte dropped Branislav Ivanovic and played with a three-man defence that started shakily, but grew into the game. Hull, however, faded badly and Costa capitalised. Both his and Willian’s goals were fine strikes into the top corner in the second half, to ensure Chelsea eased to a much-needed win after recent defeats by Arsenal and Liverpool.\n\n“We played with the right intensity and pressure,” said Conte. “For me, we played a good game and also kept the clean sheet for the second time.\n\n“After two defeats, it’s never easy. You need to work very hard, but I am happy with the commitment of the players.\n\n“It [a three-man defence] can be a big change on the tactical aspect, but I think more than the system it’s the principles that are important. This week we worked on it a lot. We must find the right solution to be more compact. We were able to defend very high and this is very important.”\n\nIn the end, Chelsea cantered home, but they were evidently learning the nuances of their new formation on the job. David Luiz was flanked by Gary Cahill and César Azpilicueta at the back, and it was Thibaut Courtois who was forced into the two significant saves of the opening half.\n\nThe first came in the third minute, when he acrobatically tipped over a Robert Snodgrass free-kick that deflected off the wall, David Luiz having pulled down Dieumerci Mbokani on the edge of the penalty area.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Thibaut Courtois saves Robert Snodgrass’ free kick in the first half. Photograph: Greig Cowie/BPI/REX/Shutterstock\n\nEden Hazard and Willian played just off Costa, but while there were a few scuffed efforts here and there, fluidity was limited early on.\n\nHazard appeared the greatest threat and, in the 40th minute, Curtis Davies had to be alert to produce a precise sliding tackle to deny the Belgian a shot at the goalkeeper David Marshall inside the area.\n\nChelsea restarted with renewed impetus and Hazard, in particular, lifted his game. Marshall was forced into a fine stop after the Blues player turned brilliantly in midfield before jinking past his marker and curling a powerful shot towards the top corner of the goal.\n\nSunderland’s Patrick van Aanholt grabs late equaliser to deny West Brom win Read more\n\nIt was the spark that Chelsea needed to begin a concerted period of pressure. Hull’s only creative outlet was Snodgrass and passes soon began to go awry for Mike Phelan’s side. Indeed, it was one such miscue that almost gave Chelsea the lead.\n\nDavies played the ball straight to N’Golo Kanté and the former Leicester City midfielder slipped in Costa, who rounded the onrushing Marshall and shot on to the post, with Jake Livermore getting the faintest of touches as he desperately slid in front of his own goal. Kanté then had a glorious opportunity to score from the rebound, but he fired over.\n\nIn the 61st minute, however, Chelsea did have their lead. Hull again gave away possession in midfield and the blue shirts swarmed forward, Costa feeding Willian out left and the Brazilian cutting into the penalty area to curl the ball exquisitely into the top corner.\n\nCue more pressure, as Hull’s confidence crumbled. Soon afterwards it was 2-0, as Costa added his sixth goal of the season after Matic, driving forward, had a shot blocked that fell to the striker, who finished coolly.\n\nPhelan, the Hull caretaker manager, said: “I was encouraged after the first half; I thought we took Chelsea to certain limits and created a few chances. But, at this level, you need to take them to be in the game.\n\n“We did not treat the ball with the care and attention it deserved, and when you do that you get punished.\n\n“I’m looking forward to a break. My future will take care of itself. I’m not in a position of panic. I’m not shying away from the challenge; it’s hard this division and we’re a newly promoted team.”"}, {"date": "01/10/2016", "arena": "Stadium of Light", "attendance": 40043, "home_team": {"name": "Sunderland", "lineup": [{"name": "Jordan Pickford", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Javi Manquillo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lamine Koné", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John O'Shea", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jason Denayer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jan Kirchhoff", "yellows": [36], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [56]}, {"name": "Duncan Watmore", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Didier Ndong", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paddy McNair", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [72]}, {"name": "Wahbi Khazri", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Jermain Defoe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Patrick van Aanholt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [83], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [56], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Papy Djilobodji", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Rodwell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [72], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Mika", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Donald Love", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "George Honeyman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lynden Gooch", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "West Bromwich Albion", "lineup": [{"name": "Ben Foster", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Craig Dawson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gareth McAuley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonny Evans", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Allan Nyom", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matt Phillips", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Darren Fletcher", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Claudio Yacob", "yellows": [27], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James McClean", "yellows": [69], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [73]}, {"name": "Nacer Chadli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [35], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Salomón Rondón", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}], "subs": [{"name": "Jonas Olsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Hal Robson-Kanu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Morrison", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Craig Gardner", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [73], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Boaz Myhill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Saido Berahino", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonathan Leko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Sunderland fans joke about Patrick van Aanholt being “dangerous at both ends” but, for once, he left David Moyes smiling. A most attacking left-back, the Dutchman has been culpable for the concession of quite a few goals during his distinctly chequered time on Wearside but, equally, scores his fair share.\n\nDropped to the bench by Moyes – (still fuming about Van Aanholt’s summertime smoking of shisha pipes) – he enjoyed one of his better afternoons after replacing the injured Jan Kirchhoff and, capitalising on a piece of wonderful skill from Duncan Watmore, scored the equaliser. The resultant draw dictates that Sunderland’s wait for a first Premier League win of the season continues but, although still bottom, they have at least doubled their points tally to two.\n\nFor long stretches of an afternoon on which Tony Pulis’s side missed several extremely presentable chances following Nacer Chadli’s assured opener, the injury hit Wearsiders looked doomed to yet another defeat but, creditably, they never folded.\n\n“West Brom are the masters of not conceding goals but we kept going,” said an unusually upbeat Moyes. “It’s a disappointment because we need wins but we’ll take something from this. I’m glad we were able to give the supporters something.”\n\nHis side very nearly enjoyed the best of beginnings. An unusually fluent home passing move concluded with Watmore’s ball finding Jermain Defoe. Having cleverly sprung the visiting offside trap, and with only Ben Foster to beat, the former England striker took a steadying touch before, uncharacteristically, dragging his shot wide from about 12 yards out.\n\nFortified by John O’Shea’s reassuring recall to central defence, Sunderland enjoyed plenty of possession, something partly facilitated by Didier Ndong’s high-energy midfield enterprise. Yet ever the realist, Moyes will doubtless have noted that this apparent dominance rarely resulted in Ben Foster being tested while West Brom menaced sporadically on the counterattack and at set pieces.\n\nWhen, at the end of one break, O’Shea and company were confounded by Matt Phillips’s pull back to Chadli, they had Jordan Pickford to thank for bailing them out, the England Under-21s goalkeeper doing well to repel the former Tottenham Hotspur player’s shot.\n\nUnfortunately for the locals Chadli was enjoying himself in the weak October sunshine and soon defied Pickford. His goal began with Kirchhoff conceding possession to Claudio Jacob and moving the ball on to Phillips. After a brief advance, his well-weighted pass fell perfectly for the scorer, whose first touch took him away from Lamine Koné. All that remained was for an attacking midfielder whose polish, pace and physical presence were already enhancing the afternoon to slide a classy, acutely angled left foot shot into the far corner. It was his third goal in four Premier League games. “Chadli,” said Pulis. “Has been fantastic for us.”\n\nChelsea get back on track as Willian and Diego Costa seal routine win at Hull Read more\n\nIf Moyes must have been disappointed with Koné, he can only have been relieved to see James McClean – heavily booed by his less-than-adoring former public – miscue a cross that had promised to offer the unmarked Salomón Rondón a simple tap-in on the verge of half-time.\n\nEarly in the new half Kirchhoff suffered the latest in a long line of injuries when he collapsed while jumping for a high ball and had to be carried off. Seeking to exacerbate Wearside misery, Darren Fletcher chested a ball down adroitly before unleashing a fine volley, ably diverted by Pickford. Home hearts were in mouths when Chadli pounced on the rebound but this time he shot wide.\n\nAt the other end, Pulis’s players generally defended admirably in the face of mounting pressure. Such sheer bloody-minded resolve was epitomised by the moment Jonny Evans brilliantly blocked Defoe’s goal-bound shot after Van Aanholt, on for Kirchhoff, and Wahbi Khazri bisected the visiting rearguard.\n\nFortunately for Moyes, Watmore possessed sufficient drive to unhinge that backline courtesy of a startling change of pace and deftly dinked ball which prefaced Van Aanholt sending a half-volley looping into the net. It was his second goal this season.\n\n“We’re really disappointed; we had 21 crosses and 18 shots, we just needed a bit more quality in the final third,” said Pulis. “But the great thing for Sunderland was that the crowd stuck with them; they kept them going.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Nacer Chadli opens the scoring with a tidy finish into the far corner.

The Hornets twice came from behind at Vicarage Road and the England hopeful Jack Wilshere spurned a glorious opportunity to win it for Bournemouth.\n\nHowe played down suggestions he would be Sam Allardyce’s successor as England manager on Thursday and repeated his focus was on Bournemouth after the Premier League clash.\n\n“It’s been the easiest thing in the world for me,” Howe said. “Football and the day-to-day workings of the job are what I love to do. So, no disrespect, I don’t take a blind bit of notice of anything that is written or said because I have to focus on the football and the players I have here.”\n\nWilshere missed out on Allardyce’s one and only England squad and did little to enhance his prospects of a return for the World Cup qualifiers with Malta and Slovakia.\n\nThe on-loan Arsenal midfielder twice hit the outside of the post, the second from six yards out with the goal gaping after Adam Smith’s cross from the right. Moments later he was substituted. Wilshere has not completed 90 minutes in a Premier League game for 20 games and more than two years. But Howe preferred to accentuate the positives as Wilshere’s hunt for a first Premier League goal since May 2015 continued.\n\n“The pleasing thing for us is that Jack’s getting in goal-scoring positions,” Howe added. “With his class and his quality there’s no doubt he’ll be scoring goals for this team in the future. The last two games he’s improved as the game has gone on. He’s grown into the game. I felt that was the same today. His influence grew. And I think he’s going to be a massive player for us.”\n\nCallum Wilson’s first-half header from Junior Stanislas’s cross was cancelled out by Troy Deeney.

It was not one of Howe’s team’s better performances.\n\nThe Bournemouth manager believes Wilson was close to an England call-up at the start of last season before a serious knee injury. Asked whether Wilson should be in Gareth Southgate’s squad, which is named on Sunday evening, Howe said: “I think he has the ability to get there.\n\n“From my perspective at the moment it’s still making sure he’s OK fitness-wise and injury-wise and continues his good form, because he’s building some momentum now.”\n\nThe Watford head coach, Walter Mazzarri, was pleased with the character shown by his side on his 55th birthday, particularly in the second half.\n\nHe said: “I was happy with my team. They had the character of never giving up and this for me is important. [At half-time] I told them that we played very well in the first half, but they have to avoid doing silly mistakes we sometimes do, giving the ball very easily to our rivals.\n\n“I also told them that given the opposition we have to press higher.

Dimitri Payet picked up the ball wide on the left and began to sashay round opponent after opponent. It was mesmerising. He took out more than half of Middlebrough’s team, gliding past five outfield players before sliding the ball past Víctor Valdés. It was a virtuoso goal, notes from a Stradivarius when everyone else seemed to be stuck in an oompah band. For all those who have found this new stadium experience hard, it was a moment to lose themselves in, to forget their travails.\n\nIt might not have been enough to inspire that craved-for victory but it was a heck of a way to stop the rot. Slaven Bilic felt compelled to compare it to the best around. “It reminded me of Messi’s goals,” he said. “I didn’t see many players scoring these kinds of goals. You get crackers, free-kicks, volleys, scissor kicks, 30-yard screamers. This was a brilliant moment of magic. That gave us a point, brought us back into the situation where we could win the game with half an hour to go.”\n\nThat they did not left Bilic with mixed emotions. “In terms of character and work rate I couldn’t ask for more. On the other hand it wasn’t the result we were looking for. With greatest respect to Middlesbrough we wanted to beat them.”\n\nBilic was left mulling over his bittersweet afternoon in the context of the bigger picture. Could Payet’s goal be the kind that proves a game changer – for the club, for the season, for the stadium, and, arguably, for his own sake? “It can,” he said. “But we can’t rely on doing that every time. We have to add quality in the front line which is the most difficult to do.\n\n“I know my situation. I know how it works. I am not thinking about my future, I am thinking about my job and I don’t like where we are in the table. I really don’t like it. I am putting myself under pressure.”\n\nWest Ham are still chasing their first Premier League win since 21 August. Bilic picked an experimental lineup in an attempt to shake things up. It might have seemed counterintuitive when you are desperate for a win to start without a recognisable striker, but Bilic chose to push Michail Antonio to a centre-forward post. Cutting edge was hard to find.\n\nComplications never feel too far away at the moment and Bilic was disappointed to see Sam Byram injure his hamstring early in the game.\n\nThe match took a while to warm up, with Mark Noble’s sweet strike against the underside of the bar the best of a humdrum first half.\n\nIn a half-time rejig, Simone Zaza replaced the ineffectual Göhkan Töre in an attempt to give West Ham more of an attacking focus. But it was a hoiked ball up the other end to Jordan Rhodes that brought the first decisive moment. Adrián raced out to meet him and saved well. From the resulting corner Cristhian Stuani met Viktor Fischer’s delivery with a thumping header. Noble was positioned on the line but cleared from just behind it. The goal was given.\n\nPayet’s response was heaven sent. There are questions about the quality of Boro’s bewildered defending, but Aitor Karanka accepted it as a stroke of pure talent. “He had an amazing Euros, so it’s nothing new,” he said. “We showed the players a lot of videos and reports. Sometimes you don’t know – is it better to be closer to him or give him one or two metres?” In this case, nothing worked.\n\nAs an atmosphere changer for West Ham it certainly did the trick. Try as they might, a winner would not follow, however. Payet was at it again before Zaza and Antonio slashed at a couple of other presentable chances.\n\nKaranka was pleased with the point for Middlesbrough, which he felt indicated an improving sense of handling the demands of the Premier League. “I am happy because the performance was good. We knew West Ham wasn’t in their best moment but when you have players like Payet who can turn a game we knew we could have problems.\n\n“We are in the position I expected at the beginning. Fighting a lot, knowing that every single point will be really, really tough. The main thing was to recover confidence and I could feel the changing room after the game, it was completely different to after Tottenham or Everton.”\n\nAll in all, for both teams, an important corner half turned.\n\nWatford rescue point against Bournemouth thanks to Isaac Success Read more\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Cristhian Stuani opens the scoring for Middlesbrough.

They avoided a third consecutive defeat here, but were only able to score through a set piece and Crystal Palace will be bitterly disappointed at seeing a perfectly valid potential winner wrongly chalked off in the second half.\n\nThe visitors were worth at least a point, playing a neat counterattacking game and coming back strongly after Everton had taken a first-half lead. Ronald Koeman said Everton would have to show more aggression and intensity if they were to return to second place in the table, and if that was the aim his players failed to produce.\n\nRomelu Lukaku was too isolated to be effective after his goal direct from a free-kick, Yannick Bolasie did not stand out against his former club and Ross Barkley had another of his wayward days, being withdrawn before the end as Koeman looked for more penetration.\n\n“When you are one nil up at home you expect to win but Palace are tough, difficult opponents,” Koeman said. “It was a fair result. I was happy with the team performance, we just couldn’t find a final pass of sufficient quality.”\n\nEverton were slightly fortunate to go ahead just past the half hour. There was nothing wrong with Lukaku’s left-foot curler from a free-kick on the edge of the area that left Steve Mandanda barely bothering to move, just a question of whether it should have been an Everton free-kick. Damien Delaney was a little harshly penalised for foot up on Phil Jagielka when the ball was just about at kickable height and he could not have been expecting his opponent to try to claim it with his head. While it was typically brave by the Everton captain, it appeared Jagielka had also handled the ball in the act of protecting his face.\n\n“I’m not sure it should have been a direct free-kick, and I don’t know what Damien could have done because the Everton player ducked his head at the last moment,” Alan Pardew said. “We normally stand tall in the wall when the free-kick is so close in, because teams will try to drill it underneath. I don’t think we were sure whether this one was far enough out for the wall to jump, but when we got in at half-time the goalkeeper was furious. He said we should definitely have jumped.”\n\nThe goal brought some life to what was becoming a scrappy contest. When the stadium announcer introduced the highlights of the first half on the Goodison big screen during the interval, the footage comprised Lukaku’s goal and nothing else. Harsh but fair. Little else in the first 45 minutes stood out in the memory.\n\nThat situation changed five minutes after the break when Christian Benteke brought Palace back level with a superb headed goal. Joel Ward did well to pick him out at the far post with a diagonal cross, but there was not much pace on the ball and Benteke was a fair way from goal with a lot of work to do.\n\nHe managed to make it look easy, first getting ahead of Seamus Coleman and timing his leap to perfection, then placing a header perfectly across Maarten Stekelenburg and into the goalkeeper’s bottom corner. Even Koeman was impressed. “It was a great goal, the best part of football is that you can’t stop everything,” the Everton manager said. Pardew is just happy to have a striker of such quality after making him the No1 transfer target in summer. “We are really pleased with Christian,” he said. “I think he was a bit unlucky not to get a run of games at Liverpool, because that’s what he needs.” Everton attempted to hit back through a Bolasie break, but though he squared the ball unselfishly across the area Idrissa Gueye’s shot was blocked by Martin Kelly.\n\nThen Palace and their captain were unlucky for the second time in the evening when Delaney rose to head another excellent Ward cross into the net, only to be wrongly ajudged offside.\n\nReplays showed James Tomkins in an offside position at the back of a pack of Palace players, but he was not interfering and Delaney himself was onside all the time. “It was a tough one, but I can accept mistakes can be made,” Pardew said.\n\nFinally there was noise and fervour in the stadium, with the game finely poised. Jason Puncheon had to clear off his own line when Gareth Barry got the faintest touch to a corner at one end, Stekelenburg had to punch clear under pressure from Joe Ledley following a free-kick at the other, but neither side was able to claim a decider.\n\n“Both sides got what they deserved,” Koeman said. “We have to be realistic. We need to be better in certain areas, but I still think we can be pleased with a positive start.”"}, {"date": "26/09/2016", "arena": "Turf Moor", "attendance": 18519, "home_team": {"name": "Burnley",

club-record £7.5m paid to Anderlecht for a player once coveted by European heavyweights, has paid early dividends. Defour, desire and determination shaped Burnley’s second Premier League win of the season. Watford were second rate in every respect.\n\nThe Belgium international still has the letter he received from Sir Alex Ferguson shortly after injury ruined his hopes of Champions League football with Standard Liège and, as it later transpired, a move to Manchester United. Now 28, he still possesses the ability and energy to punish teams as weak as Watford – unrecognisable from the side that triumphed over United last time out – and a quality Burnley lacked on their last appearance in the Premier League. The midfielder’s assists for Jeff Hendrick and Michael Keane brought Dyche’s team deserved victory and means he has been involved in four of his new club’s five goals this term.\n\n“He is still learning and adapting to the Premier League but he is definitely a good player otherwise we wouldn’t have brought him here,” the Burnley and former Watford manager said. “He, Jeff and Johann [Berg Gudmundsson] have all been brought in for a reason. We haven’t got the budget to bring in players, move them on and have a squad of 30. Every player we have brought in is important. Steven has that extra belief from playing for Belgium and in big games. He has a strength of character and that rubs off on others.”\n\nBurnley were again solid defensively at Turf Moor, where they have conceded five goals in 17 home matches and became the first team this season to shut out Walter Mazzarri’s side. They were also confident and strong in midfield – “They bullied us,” Troy Deeney admitted – and just needed an attacking threat to complement a dominant first-half performance. Hendrick’s headed breakthrough was just reward for their efforts and patience.\n\nDyche’s side have struggled in front of goal on their return to the top flight and their attacking options were reduced by the absence of Andre Gray, starting a four-match ban for making homophobic comments on Twitter four years ago. “We know the tweet was unacceptable,” the Burnley manager said. “But we are very disappointed with the four-game ban. Andre was the first one to come straight out and apologise. He misses 12% of our games now. It is a hard one to take, simple as that.”\n\nWatford were overrun in midfield and had problems from the outset with the quality of Defour’s set pieces, his vision and the power of Gudmundsson on the right. Their strangely subdued response was a poor return for the 1,415 in the away section for a Monday-night fixture and Mazzarri vowed to hold talks with his players in training on Tuesday.\n\nGeorge Boyd had almost opened the scoring from a Defour corner, Heurelho Gomes producing a fine save, when more weak defending enabled Burnley to profit from the same source shortly before the interval. Watford were incensed at the referee Mike Jones’ decision to award the corner, arguing for an offside in the build-up and that the ball was out of play when Dean Marney crossed from the right. José Holebas picked up a booking for dissent but the officials appeared to call both correctly. It was Holebas’s job to mark Hendrick when Defour’s corner sailed into his penalty area but he allowed the Republic of Ireland midfielder a free header which he sent into the far corner. The Republic assistant manager Roy Keane’s decision to attend the game was vindicated.\n\nMazzarri introduced Camilo Zúñiga for Craig Cathcart at the interval but the visitors’ defence continued to afford Defour too much space and struggled against his precise crosses. Deeney hinted at an overdue show of urgency from Watford when he broke into the Burnley box and forced a decent save from Tom Heaton, but the recovery did not materialise.\n\nBurnley responded immediately to Deeney’s show of intent and forced a corner on the left. Watford dealt with the initial cross from Defour but were found badly wanting when he gathered the loose ball, looked up and swept a perfect delivery towards Keane. The former Manchester United graduate, a member of their FA Youth Cup-winning team in 2011 alongside Paul Pogba and Jesse Lingard, simply wanted it more than any player in white and Mazzarri looked aghast as Keane headed beyond Gomes in the absence of one meaningful challenge.\n\n“This was a game that had to prove we could do better than we played against Manchester United,” the Watford coach said. “We wanted continuity and we didn’t get it so I will speak with my players.”"}, {"date": "25/09/2016", "arena": "London Stadium", "attendance": 56864, "home_team": {"name": "West Ham United",

decided to leave Upton Park. The burst of optimism that greeted their move to the London Stadium has given way to an unmistakable sense of drift, on and off the pitch, and Slaven Bilic could only watch helplessly as Claude Puel’s sleek Southampton inflicted a third defeat on his ragged team in their new home.\n\nWest Ham United v Southampton: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nAt this point, however, it would be a flimsy excuse for West Ham to argue that anyone would experience these teething problems after moving grounds. Their flaws run deeper than that. They have conceded two or more goals in 15 of their past 23 matches, did not force Fraser Forster to make a single save in the Southampton goal and played with the louche air of a team who are yet to accept the severity of the situation.\n\nWhile West Ham find themselves stuck in the bottom three and look like a team without any discernible plan after losing five of their opening six league matches, Southampton shot up to ninth place, thanks to a performance that showcased the craft and intelligence that persuaded them to appoint Puel after Ronald Koeman’s summer departure to Everton.\n\nIt was a stroll for the visitors after Charlie Austin’s composed finish shattered West Ham’s fragile confidence long before James Ward-Prowse added a third goal in stoppage time and there was a pleasing verve to their play, their zest encapsulated by the way Dusan Tadic left Adrián on the floor before making it 2-0 shortly after the hour.\n\nAfter a slightly unconvincing start to life under Puel this was their fourth successive victory in all competitions. “In the second half we could see a team with a good technical level,” the Frenchman said.\n\nWest Ham were fortunate not to be beaten out of sight and as a mood of uncertainty spread around this curious ground before kick-off, it felt like a sign of the times that, to borrow the terminology favoured by the stadium operators, customers were advised that persistent standing would result in offenders being ejected. Those kind of messages explain why it is difficult not to suspect that the club left an indelible part of its identity back at Upton Park and it was not long before stewards were trying to persuade the boisterous little pocket of home fans near the away end to sit down.\n\nWest Ham restore order off the field, but are in disarray on it Read more\n\nArguments in the stands were not Bilic’s main concern. He needed a response after the defensive capitulations against Watford and West Bromwich Albion but West Ham were ponderous on the ball, predictable in attack and vulnerable whenever Southampton broke forward.\n\nMark Noble and Cheikhou Kouyaté were passengers in midfield unable to cope with Southampton’s diamond as the game wore on, while Dimitri Payet was subdued. Simone Zaza has not hit the ground running after joining on loan from Juventus and there was none of Michail Antonio’s usual brio.\n\nIndividual errors, tactical indiscipline and the failure to defend as a collective unit have all contributed to West Ham’s decline and it was no help that knee injuries to Arthur Masuaku and Aaron Cresswell deprived Bilic of both of his left-backs.\n\nÁlvaro Arbeloa, who did not possess the pace to support West Ham’s attack, filled in after moving across from the right while Havard Nordtveit was a fish out of water at right-back.\n\nComfortable in defence, measured in midfield and lively up front, Southampton sought to capitalise on that weakness and the origins of Austin’s opener were not a surprise, given that Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg had already fired an early warning shot. Nordtveit, who was signed to play in midfield, failed to read the danger when Tadic slipped a pass behind the Norwegian and Ryan Bertrand’s cutback found Austin, who took advantage of slack marking from Angelo Ogbonna by sweeping a low finish beyond Adrián.\n\nSoon Cédric Soares was almost doubling Southampton’s lead after peeling behind Arbeloa and Bilic had seen enough, replacing the ineffectual Manuel Lanzini with Sofiane Feghouli at half-time. That change allowed Payet to slot into the No10 role but Zaza remained forlorn and isolated.\n\nWest Ham’s defending ‘laughable’, says Mark Noble after Southampton shocker Read more\n\nWest Ham fought back from a goal down to win this fixture last season. But they are a pale imitation of their former selves, mustering little beyond a couple of half-hearted penalty appeals, and Southampton would not let them off the hook this time.\n\nAlthough Tadic’s goal was a wonderful piece of skill, it was also a damning indictment of West Ham’s lax attitude. Winston Reid and Kouyaté took it in turns to bungle with the ball just outside their own area and Nathan Redmond combined with Austin, who released Tadic. Faced by Adrián again, the Serb duped the goalkeeper with a dreamy body swerve before rolling the ball into the unguarded net.\n\nThat masterclass in efficiency and imagination from Tadic encapsulated the difference between the two teams and the only surprise was that Southampton had to wait until the dying moments before Ward-Prowse scored a simple third."}, {"date": "24/09/2016", "arena": "Old

fact José Mourinho had decided to remove Wayne Rooney from his starting lineup. If this was the old Manchester United at work, it also looked suspiciously like the old Leicester. Put the two together and it was not just Rooney’s absence that contributed to the reigning champions of England taking such a walloping against a team that would desperately love to go by that title again.\n\nAll the same, Mourinho’s team selection was fully justified given the margin of victory and that 20-minute blitz in the first half when his side scored all their goals and looked equipped to add even more. It was an exhilarating burst of attacking football and in those moments it was tempting to wonder what must have been going through Rooney’s mind in the dugout. Sir Alex Ferguson has dropped him in the past. Louis van Gaal did the same at Stoke on Boxing Day but never has there been such a sense that United genuinely look better off without the man who has led their attack for the past 12 years.\n\nJosé Mourinho insists there is no problem with Wayne Rooney Read more\n\nHis absence coincided with United’s most satisfying result to date in the Mourinho era and it must have pained a player with Rooney’s competitive instincts to be restricted to the role of an 83rd-minute substitute, brought on only because Marcus Rashford had taken a bang. Mourinho preferred Juan Mata in his starting lineup and the Spaniard, operating in the No10 role, scored United’s best goal as well as being instrumental in the part of the match when Leicester were overwhelmed. Paul Pogba put in his best performance since joining the club, including scoring his first United goal, and Rashford continued his fine scoring form. The system did not change but the personnel did and United did not look back after Chris Smalling’s header instigated the kind of Leicester collapse that would have been unimaginable for most of last season.\n\nLeicester did save some face with their second-half performance, featuring a splendid goal from the substitute Demarai Gray, but they barely looked recognisable from the side that were taking on all-comers not so long ago and it was a jarring reflection of their deterioration that Jamie Vardy and Riyad Mahrez, the two players who shared last season’s individual awards, were substituted at half-time.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Paul Pogba peels away to celebrate after scoring Manchester United’s fourth goal of the game and his first for the club. Photograph: Carl Recine/Reuters\n\nRanieri talked afterwards of his players losing “our confidence, our strength, our attention, our concentration” and his team have now lost as many league games as they did all last season. This was their second successive away defeat of this score, having gone a year without a comparable loss, and he must be alarmed, to say the least, by their sudden disorganisation. A side that built its success on teamwork, structure and a rare spirit of togetherness might have to reinvent themselves unless their title defence is to descend into a long old slog.\n\nIt was certainly unusual, to say the least, to see any side at this level concede three goals from corners. Daley Blind, deputising for the injured Luke Shaw at left-back, took all of them in Rooney’s absence and the tone was set, midway through the first half, when Robert Huth, normally such an imposing presence in his own penalty area, lost the first one in mid-air and Smalling powered a downward header into the net.\n\nPogba’s goal was another unchallenged header from the same route and, by half-time, Leicester’s defenders looked in need of smelling salts. Kasper Schmeichel was badly missed but his deputy, Ron-Robert Zieler, could not be held accountable for the kind of generous defending that left the team so vulnerable.\n\nUnited’s third goal was a case in point. This time, Blind decided against putting in a cross. Instead, he picked out the quick-thinking Mata with a low pass towards the near post. Mata whipped the ball across the six-yard area and Rashford, showing his own speed of thought, dived in to apply the finishing touch without a single Leicester player reacting.\n\nThe paradox is that it had actually been a plodding start from the home side, looking decidedly uneasy after the two previous league defeats that had led to prolonged criticism of the side and provoked a cranky performance from Mourinho in his post-match interviews. Smalling’s goal had therapeutic qualities and even before Mata made it 2-0 there were other moments to lift a hitherto quiet crowd. First Zlatan Ibrahimovic sent Rashford clear, only for the teenager to slash at his shot. Soon afterwards, Ibrahimovic cushioned Pogba’s flick on his chest, spun and volleyed over. Pogba then had a go from 30 yards and Zieler scrambled the ball around for a corner.\n\nMata certainly justified his place and his goal originated from the game’s outstanding move. Pogba was involved again and it was a lovely touch from Jesse Lingard to create the shooting opportunity. The most impressive part, however, was that Mata had started the exchange, playing the ball into Pogba and darting into the penalty area. Two passes later, the ball was back at his feet and he aimed his left-foot shot inside Zieler’s right-hand post.\n\nPerhaps it was just inevitable United would lower their effort after the break, whereas Gray seemed determined to inspire an improved second-half performance from the visitors. His goal was a beauty, coming in from the left before aiming a diagonal, long-range shot high into David de Gea’s net. There was never any realistic chance, however, of a comeback in the remaining half an hour and, for Rooney, there is the lingering thought that he might have to grow accustomed to his new role."},

his team did little to suggest otherwise on the south coast, where they fell to their first Premier League defeat of the season. For Eddie Howe, this was a true Bournemouth performance, full of intensity and vigour, as his side recorded back-to-back home wins in the league for the first time since March. Howe apologised to supporters for his team’s dismal performance in the EFL Cup defeat by Preston on Tuesday but was never in danger of having to do so here.\n\nBournemouth set the tone from the off, Callum Wilson glancing a header narrowly wide after 61 seconds.

Harry Arter picked out Junior Stanislas, one of 11 changes from the defeat in midweek. The winger, who scored Bournemouth’s 98th-minute equaliser in this fixture last November, was celebrating again here on 23 minutes, dispatching his shot beyond Stekelenburg after finding himself in space on the edge of the area.\n\nThe bite of the Bournemouth midfield was too much for Everton, who were overawed by the magnificent Arter, undoubtedly the man of the match, Andrew Surman and Jack Wilshere, who was substituted late on to a standing ovation.\n\n“I thought we were absolutely brilliant today, as good as we were bad on Tuesday,” said Howe. “And that’s the biggest compliment I can give everyone in the squad about the response. I thought it was an outstanding performance, and the most pleasing thing is that we performed that way against a very good team.\n\n“I’m loth to pick out individuals but Harry covered every blade of grass and technically he had a very good game as well. The midfield looked exciting for the future. We had a very nice dynamic in there.”\n\nEverton failed to ask questions of a Bournemouth defence that had kept just one clean sheet in their previous 14 matches and Romelu Lukaku, the Belgium striker who returned to the lineup after a toe injury, was comfortably shackled. Koeman cut an animated figure on the touchline, as his team struggled to test the Bournemouth goalkeeper Artur Boruc. Lukaku’s first-half header from Ross Barkley’s free-kick, when Boruc saved well, was the only time the goalkeeper was troubled.\n\n“Maybe, yes,” said Koeman, asked if this defeat had brought Everton down to earth. “We were not good enough and in the first half Bournemouth was the better team, with more aggression, winning second balls, and it was difficult to find our play.”\n\nGerard Deulofeu was introduced 10 minutes into the second half, and the Spanish winger at least gave Charlie Daniels something to think about in the Bournemouth defence.\n\nKoeman later introduced Enner Valencia, the on-loan West Ham forward, as one of four strikers in search of a goal but Bournemouth did not give Everton an inch. When they did, Valencia’s effort from Yannick Bolasie’s deep cross catapulted off the forward’s knee, as Bournemouth held on to record their first ever victory over Everton, whose unbeaten run in the

I’m not going to pick holes in the team or the players. You don’t want to find yourself down to 10 men against any opposition, never mind Arsenal and now Liverpool. There are harsh lessons in football and we have learned some over the last week.”\n\nTwo James Milner penalties and goals from the impressive Adam Lallana, Sadio Mané and Philippe Coutinho took Liverpool’s tally to 24 in eight games. At the corresponding stage of last season, under Brendan Rodgers, they had scored six. Klopp had called for anger from his players and patience from the crowd but there was no examination of the latter as Liverpool took control immediately and a comfortable early lead.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Adam Lallana celebrates scoring Liverpool’s first goal against Hull in the Premier League match at Anfield. Photograph: Eddie Keogh/Reuters\n\nHull set up to stifle Liverpool’s runs from midfield plus the varying threats of Coutinho and Mané either side of Roberto Firmino. They were powerless on all counts, even with 11 men. Joel Matip and Coutinho had both missed clear chances before the hosts swept in front with another demonstration of how their understanding in the final third and Lallana’s influence have grown this season.\n\nCoutinho was the creator, exchanging passes with Milner on the left and ghosting away from Ryan Mason before feeding Lallana’s run. The England international had work to do but, before Andrew Robertson could intervene, he guided the ball behind the defender and inside David Marshall’s left post.\n\nAnother flowing, enterprising move ensured there was no way back for Hull with a third of the game gone. Firmino released Mané into space and when Coutinho met the Senegal striker’s pass with a powerful drive beyond Marshall, Elmohamady stuck out his right arm to deny a certain goal. The referee, Andre Marriner, had no hesitation in pointing to the spot and showing a straight red card. The Egyptian was heading down the tunnel when Milner tucked his penalty beyond Marshall’s dive to his left. “It is a sending-off and a penalty,” Phelan accepted. “Probably now there is a mentality that is better to let the ball go in and stay on the field.”\n\nHull were in damage-limitation mode and Liverpool were showcasing long before the interval. Georginio Wijnaldum even had time to nutmeg the referee. Mané got the goal his efforts deserved following more good work by Lallana. Spinning away from Mason on the corner of the Hull area, the midfielder picked out Mané and he provided a fine finish to beat Marshall low to his right.\n\nThe visitors grabbed a consolation when Loris Karius, selected ahead of Simon Mignolet in Liverpool’s goal, stayed on his line when Robertson curled a corner in from the left. Wijnaldum, under pressure from the substitute Harry Maguire at his back, was unable to clear with his header and his fellow substitute David Meyler converted with a close-range volley.\n\nThe comeback always seemed a fanciful prospect and Liverpool restored their three-goal advantage in magnificent style within seconds. Once again Lallana was involved, cutting across the Hull defence and finding Coutinho lurking in the area where he causes most damage. The Brazilian accepted the invitation to beat Marshall with a trademark shot from 25 yards and the home team continued to coast towards a fourth consecutive victory.\n\nLallana received a standing ovation when replaced by Daniel Sturridge and the substitute was quickly involved in the procession, going over Robertson’s trailing leg inside the area and earning Liverpool a second spot-kick. The result was the same as the first, Milner firing low to Marshall’s left, and, as with the game itself, had never looked in doubt."}, {"date": "24/09/2016", "arena": "Riverside Stadium", "attendance": 32703, "home_team": {"name": "Middlesbrough", "lineup": [{"name": "Victor Valdes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Antonio Barragan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Calum Chambers", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Gibson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [65], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "George Friend", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marten de Roon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Clayton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [82]}, {"name": "Christian Stuani", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gaston Ramirez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [59]}, {"name": "Stewart Downing", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Álvaro Negredo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [59]}], "subs": [{"name": "Daniel Ayala", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordan Rhodes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [59], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Viktor Fischer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Brad Guzan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Emilio Nsue", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Forshaw", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [82], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adama Traore", "yellows": [87], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [59], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Tottenham Hotspur", "lineup": [{"name": "Hugo Lloris", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Walker", "yellows": [63], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Toby Alderweireld", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jan Vertonghen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Davies", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Eriksen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Victor Wanyama", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dele Alli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Moussa Sissoko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [70]}, {"name": "Vincent Janssen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [86]}, {"name": "Heung-Min Son", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [7, 23], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Erik Lamela", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [70], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michel Vorm", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Georges-Kevin N'Koudou", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kieran Trippier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin Wimmer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Winks", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [86], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cameron Carter-Vickers", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Tottenham have begun this season as they played much of the last. All talk of a potential hangover from the latter days of the previous campaign can surely be eviscerated after a fourth Premier League win, and another stellar display from Son Heung-min, maintained their unbeaten start.\n\nMauricio Pochettino’s side outclassed Middlesbrough before a significant week that includes a trip to CSKA Moscow and home game against Manchester City. They have conceded three times in the league and with Son in a patch of deep purple concerns about the length of Harry Kane’s potential absence are perhaps not so pressing.\n\nJunior Stanislas earns Bournemouth deserved home victory over Everton Read more\n\nKane injured an ankle against Sunderland and was not in the squad here, missing his fourth league game since the start of the 2014-15 season, but Spurs were as potent in attack as ever.\n\nSon’s two goals were brilliantly taken – even if Boro’s defending was tame – and although the introduction of Adama Traoré improved things for Aitor Karanka’s side, they were comprehensively outplayed.\n\nFor Son, a player who came close to leaving in the summer, it is quite a turnaround. Pochettino said: “It’s fantastic for him. He’s a player that works hard and is a nice guy. In football, if you work hard you get the payback.\n\n“For all players who come from outside England it’s difficult – the Premier League is one of the toughest in the world. To settle here is a very difficult thing. After one year and the summer, today it’s a different situation for him. He’s more mature and is settled fantastically now.”\n\nThe first half was one of the worst played by Middlesbrough here for some time. Karanka sat in his seat, hand planted on face, while his team struggled to string a pass together and looked vulnerable every time Spurs attacked.\n\nGranted, Tottenham were impressively slick, but their progress was made simpler by Boro’s ragtag defending which, at one stage, prompted the goalkeeper Victor Valdés to exchange heated words with his team-mate Adam Clayton.\n\nIt was Son’s half. The South Korean now has four Premier League goals this season after two at Stoke – as many as in the entire 2015-16 campaign – and was equally dangerous as a provider and a finisher.\n\nBoth goals, however, emerged following weak defending. In the seventh minute Christian Eriksen played the ball into Vincent Janssen’s feet and, with his back to goal, the striker laid it off to Son. There was still work to be done, but he skipped inside two limp challenges before finishing low with his left foot.\n\nKaranka said: “It’s frustrating for me to be working seven days to try to show them how Tottenham play, how good they are. After seven days working with the video, you go to the pitch and seven minutes later you are losing 1-0.\n\n“The worst thing, and most frustrating thing for me, is the attitude, especially in the first half because in the second half we were completely different. The first half was awful.”\n\nSoon, it was two. On this occasion, the defending was even worse – Antonio Barragán and Cristhian Stuani got in an almighty muddle inside the penalty area near the byline, but Son still had work to do. The 24-year-old muscled back on the ball and curled a delightful shot past Valdés and into the goalkeeper’s top-left corner.\n\nKaranka had to do something about his team’s malaise and duly replaced Álvaro Negredo with Jordan Rhodes – a decision greeted with loud applause – and the ineffective Gastón Ramírez with Traoré in the 58th minute.\n\nIt was the impetus that the home team required and, out of nothing, they pulled one back, Ben Gibson outjumping Victor Wanyama to head in Stewart Downing’s free-kick from the left.\n\nThe Riverside was rocking momentarily, but it proved irrelevant. Spurs remained calm as tempers rose to secure another victory and consolidate their position at the top end of the Premier League."}, {"date": "24/09/2016", "arena": "Bet365 Stadium", "attendance": 27645, "home_team": {"name": "Stoke City", "lineup": [{"name": "Lee Grant", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Glen Johnson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Shawcross", "yellows": [26], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bruno Martins Indi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Erik Pieters", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Geoff Cameron", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Glenn Whelan", "yellows": [16], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Allen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [73], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [86]}, {"name": "Xherdan Shaqiri", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [88]}, {"name": "Wilfried Bony", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [61]}, {"name": "Marko Arnautovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Phil Bardsley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charlie Adam", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [86], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mame Biram Diouf", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [88], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gianelli Imbula", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shay Given", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Peter Crouch", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [61], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bojan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "West Bromwich Albion", "lineup": [{"name": "Ben Foster", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Craig Dawson", "yellows": [60], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gareth McAuley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonny Evans", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Allan Nyom", "yellows": [70], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Claudio Yacob", "yellows": [54], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [78]}, {"name": "Matt Phillips", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [88]}, {"name": "Darren Fletcher", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nacer Chadli", "yellows": [37], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James McClean", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [77]}, {"name": "Salomón Rondón", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [90], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Jonas Olsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Morrison", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [78], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Craig Gardner", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Boaz Myhill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Hal Robson-Kanu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [77], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonathan Leko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [88], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sam Field", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "A first league victory of the season for Stoke was the only milestone that mattered to Mark Hughes on a day when Tony Pulis took charge of a team for the 1,000th time. Stoke looked on course for just that after Joe Allen scored in the 73rd minute.\n\nBut they did not make it over the line, as Salomón Rondón headed into their net from a corner in stoppage time.

That reflected defiance in the face of Stoke’s poor start to the season and was combined with loud encouragement for the home team.\n\nStoke’s players were similarly upbeat, betraying no sign of disenchantment, just a hunger to quash Albion.\n\nIt made for a rousing first period in which clear chances were scarce but the threat of a breakthrough was always present.\n\nAlbion were no bystanders, indeed they fired the first shot. But Rondón’s curler in the sixth minute whizzed wide, meaning that Lee Grant did not have to make his first Premier League save since joining Stoke on loan from Derby County in the summer.\n\nThe 33-year-old was picked instead of Shay Given as part of Hughes’s plan to solidify a leaky defence.\n\nTony Pulis: ‘You get pigeonholed.

Their midfield, with Allen thriving in an advanced role, pestered the visitors relentlessly and, when they won the ball, attacked immediately.\n\nIn the 25th minute Glenn Whelan pinged a cross to Wilfried Bony, who headed the ball across the six-yard box. Glen Johnson lifted it over the advancing Ben Foster, only for Craig Dawson to head off the line.\n\nTwice Eric Pieters fell under untidy tackles by Matt Phillips but no penalties were given. Hughes ran through the full Basil Fawlty routine – in his technical area so as not to incur another fine – but conceded after seeing replays that “both were close calls, in fairness”.\n\nEarly in the second half Allen nearly gave Stoke the goal they craved but Dawson denied them again, deflecting the midfielder’s header over.\n\nBony was the only home player to disappoint, strong in possession but lacking the mobility to be in regular synch with his team-mates. He was replaced on the hour by Peter Crouch.\n\nStoke claimed the reward for their persistence in the 73rd minute when Xherdan Shaqiri crossed from the left and Jonny Evans failed to make a clean clearance owing to a challenge by Marko Arnautovic. Allen shot into the net from eight yards. He was a fitting scorer.\n\n“[Allen’s] got good anticipation of things dropping around the box and that showed for the goal,” said Hughes. “That’s why he left Liverpool, because he wanted to play week in, week out and we’ve given him the run of games. He’s been a shining light for us, he’s been the one hitting the levels we expect.”\n\nGrant preserved the lead with a fine save from a header by James McClean but he could not keep out Rondón’s header at the death.\n\nSo it was yet another happy day at Stoke for Pulis. “The place is wonderful and the crowd were fantastic to me when I was here,” said the Albion manager. “It’s been stitched into my body this football club.

Then, suddenly, and completely against the run of play, Jermain Defoe very nearly scored.\n\nDefensively suspect but much more impressive going forward, Patrick van Aanholt sheared his way down Palace’s right and his low cross was met by Defoe, whose adroit flick looked destined for the bottom corner before being deflected inches wide.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest James McArthur, left, celebrates his goal with his Crystal Palace team-mates at Sunderland.

Under pressure from Adnan Januzaj, Joe Ledley attempted to pick out Damien Delaney with a back pass but miscued horribly, leaving it to fall virtually at Defoe’s feet. Having already outmanoeuvred James Tomkins, Moyes’s prize asset shot low beyond Steve Mandanda’s reach, leaving Ledley staring at the floor.\n\nAcross in the technical area, Moyes’s expression offered a definition of relief, albeit a tentative and slightly disbelieving one. For once, he had enjoyed a little luck but Pardew’s players might have equalised almost immediately. When Benteke connected with a corner, his ensuing headed flick prefaced Delaney volleying fractionally wide.\n\nAfter being virtually in complete control, Palace were now required to take risks as they chased an equaliser, offering Sunderland counterattacking opportunities along the way.\n\nFootball clockwatch: Swansea v Man City, Middlesbrough v Spurs – as they happened Read more\n\nFrom one such break Defoe – without whom Sunderland really would be sunk – briefly appeared to have shredded Pardew’s gameplan. No sooner had Mandanda performed wonders to repel one of his shots than Duncan Watmore’s slide-rule pass cued him up once more. This time, Palace’s goalkeeper had no answer to Defoe’s low, 12 yard, finish.\n\nPardew seemed momentarily crestfallen but Wearsiders will not have been entirely surprised to see Palace reduce the deficit within seconds. Endeavouring to block Ledley’s speculative shot, Van Aanholt merely succeeded in deflecting the ball beyond Pickford.\n\nWith hope rekindled, the visiting manager made an inspired substitution. Zeki Fryers had barely replaced Martin Kelly than his exquisite left-wing cross was met by James McArthur, who headed powerfully past Pickford. Moyes will not have been impressed to note that Van Aanholt was dodged all too easily by the scorer, while Fryers had earlier delighted in side-stepping Javier Manquillo.\n\nPalace were not quite done. If Moyes felt reprieved when Andros Townsend cut inside and curled a late shot wide, his afternoon was ruined when Paddy McNair needlessly conceded a free-kick, taken near the corner flag by Lee Chung-yong and, deep into stoppage time, an unmarked Benteke rose imperiously to clinch it.\n\n“I was really scratching my head as to how we could get back into it,” Pardew said. “But our quick response to Jermain’s second goal affected Sunderland’s mentality and it’s become a great day for us.”"}, {"date": "24/09/2016", "arena": "The Liberty Stadium", "attendance": 20786, "home_team":

of successive victories into double figures, with Sergio Agüero carrying on where he left off prior to his suspension. But Pep Guardiola’s side never had everything their own way with Swansea giving as good as they got for an hour.\n\nLiverpool’s Adam Lallana inspires emphatic win over 10-man Hull Read more\n\nThe turning point was the penalty kick that Neil Swarbrick awarded in the second half, when the referee penalised Mike van der Hoorn for an elbow on Kevin De Bruyne. Van der Hoorn and his Swansea team-mates were bitterly upset with that decision, but television replays suggested Swarbrick made the right call and once Agüero dispatched his penalty for his second goal of the match and his 11th of the season City tightened their grip on a terrific game.\n\nSwansea, who produced their best performance of the season at a time when their manager, Francesco Guidolin, needed it most, had equalised earlier on through an exquisite goal from Fernando Llorente, but it was hard to see the home team responding for a second time.\n\nCity, instead, added a third, when the rejuvenated Raheem Sterling ran half the length of the pitch before registering his fourth goal of the season.\n\nThis victory means Guardiola has become the second manager to win his first six Premier League matches, following in the footsteps of Carlo Ancelotti, who did the same thing with Chelsea in 2009, and it promises to be some game at White Hart Lane next Sunday when City take on Tottenham Hotspur in a top-of-the-table match.\n\nSome of City’s numbers are extraordinary. They have scored 30 goals this season and Agüero now has 28 in his past 27 Premier League matches.\n\nThere was an air of nonchalance about the way the Argentinian chipped his penalty kick down the middle and it was a sublime first touch that created the space to drill home his first.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Raheem Sterling scores Manchester City’s third goal to round off another victory. Photograph: Michael Steele/Getty Images\n\nGuardiola, however, is far from satisfied with the striker. “Congratulations for his first goal and for the personality for the penalty, he’s scored a lot of goals in the games, so I am so happy for him,” City’s manager said. “But he knows that I want more. He can play better. He can do other things that is going to help us. I will try to help him to develop his abilities. I want him to be involved in our game, in our process, and keep the ball.\n\n“In the box I cannot help him – he’s going to help us a lot in the box, he’s magnificent. His first control for the opening goal was outstanding, but I want to help him to be a better player.”\n\nThe only bad news for City was the sight of De Bruyne pulling up with what looked like a hamstring problem nine minutes from time. By that point the game was over, Swansea’s brave resistance broken by the breakaway goal Sterling scored when he skipped past Kyle Naughton with a lovely stepover before coolly beating the goalkeeper, Lukasz Fabianski.\n\nIt was a fourth defeat in six league games for Swansea and Guidolin may well struggle to hold on to his job beyond next Saturday’s match against Liverpool, although in fairness to the Italian this was a much-improved display. Playing with the belief that has been so lacking of late, Swansea were excellent for two-thirds of the match as they produced some lovely passages of football and worked tirelessly to win the ball back.\n\nLlorente led the line superbly and scored a wonderful goal, his left-foot half-volley arrowing past Claudio Bravo and into the top corner following Gylfi Sigurdsson’s clever pass.\n\nFootball clockwatch: Swansea v Man City, Middlesbrough v Spurs – as they happened Read more\n\nAgüero had opened the scoring four minutes earlier, expertly controlling Bacary Sagna’s pass and turning Jordi Amat in one motion before drilling home.\n\nChances came and went at both ends and Guidolin was right to point out that Swansea had a couple of opportunities to take the lead in the second half, but City were a constant threat going forward with their slick movement and one-touch passing. In the end, though, it was Van der Hoorn’s challenge on De Bruyne that opened the door for Guardiola’s side to restore their lead, with Sterling’s goal ending any hopes Guidolin had of salvaging a point.\n\nThe Swansea manager described his team’s performance as perfect and insisted he was not concerned about his job. “I do not feel under pressure,” he said. “I do not need to speak to the chairman.

Arsenal, rampant and irrepressible, have become the latest contenders to expose just how far Chelsea have slipped in the period since they claimed the Premier League. On this evidence, it is barely conceivable that those in blue had hoisted the trophy only 16 months ago. Their current, dishevelled selection surrendered meekly here, just as they had to Liverpool the previous week, from the moment they were breached. It ended up as a brutal humiliation to endure.\n\nArsène Wenger will hardly care, with this an exorcism of sorts of the “inconvenient facts” thrown up by his side’s recent record against these opponents. Even in his wildest dreams, the Frenchman could never have contemplated celebrating two decades in charge in such a wildly authoritative manner. Retreat to 2003 and Chelsea, with their Russian oligarch owner recently in situ, were arguably the club who most undermined Wenger’s original project by shifting the landscape just as the Invincibles were threatening a period of dominance. In that context, the Arsenal manager took particular pleasure in seeing his side inflict this drubbing in such scintillating fashion.\n\nNot since Robin van Persie had run riot at Stamford Bridge in the distant days of André Villas-Boas’s dysfunctional tenure across the capital had Arsenal achieved such a satisfying return from this fixture. They had not even managed a goal in the teams’ previous six meetings. This was the home side making up for lost time, tearing into vulnerable rivals and ruthlessly cutting them to shreds. “We did it with style and steel,” offered Wenger. “You always want the perfect game but you never get it. But we got almost the perfect first half here, and that is not bad.” That smacked of understatement.\n\nJordan Henderson’s sumptuous strike helps Liverpool to win at Chelsea Read more\n\nIt was the pace and invention of their attacking approach that rendered Chelsea so helpless though, in truth, they were only emulating what Liverpool had inflicted upon these ramshackle opponents eight days previously. Jürgen Klopp’s side had bypassed this same rearguard with their own blend of pace of pass and speed of thought. Everyone knows that Arsenal, on their day, can match that upbeat rhythm. What is becoming increasingly clear, with each passing week and stuttering defensive display, is that Antonio Conte cannot perform miracles with this Chelsea team to repel it. Their rearguard looks broken.\n\nThe manager actually questioned his players’ attitude, reminding them publicly and repeatedly that, at present, “we are a great team only on paper, and not on the pitch”. Even that theory might be flawed if it was the mid-table slump of 2016, rather than the title of 2015, which better reflects this team’s abilities. Conte, his hackles raised, urged his players to prove their quality through his post-match monotone, but his patience is clearly running thin. This team’s creaking defence, a backline too fragile to provide any kind of platform for a title challenge, is a constant concern. Without John Terry’s organisational skills they looked utterly rudderless, but to be reliant upon a 35-year-old who has been surviving on one-year contract extensions for three seasons seems vaguely ludicrous.\n\nThe ease with which Arsenal waltzed through the visitors’ ranks, whether the attacks were led by a revived Theo Walcott and Mesut Özil, or Alex Iwobi and Alexis Sánchez, was inexcusable. Özil was showboating on the touchline before the interval in the afterglow of his goal, volleyed down and into the turf to loop over Thibaut Courtois and dribble in off the far post. That chance had stemmed from the German’s sprint from deep, away from N’Golo Kanté, and then an exchange with Sánchez which rendered David Luiz and Gary Cahill dazed and confused. At times this felt cruel. It was certainly all too easily inflicted.\n\nArsenal 3-0 Chelsea: Premier League - as it happened Read more\n\nChelsea’s backline were strangers groping in the dark. They had shipped twice within 141 seconds early on and, while Arsenal’s second was a thing of beauty, the first had shattered any conviction that lingered in the visitors’ ranks. Branislav Ivanovic’s back pass was unhelpful at best, awkward at worst, but Cahill should still have dealt with it. Instead, he dawdled on the ball, perhaps contemplating a lay-off to Courtois, and was duly dispossessed by the galloping Sánchez. The Chilean advanced and calmly clipped his finish over the advancing goalkeeper. At Swansea, Cahill had been fouled by the eventual scorer, Leroy Fer, in a similar scenario. Here he was culpable.\n\nThereafter Arsenal dazzled. The slick delivery and clever movement that dragged Chelsea horribly out of position moments later took the breath away, Özil twice zipping passes to the excellent Iwobi before the youngster slipped Héctor Bellerín free beyond a dizzied Eden Hazard. All resistance melted away. Bellerín slid his centre across for Walcott to score first time and, over on the touchline, Conte spun on his heels, hand clamped to his chin and disgust etched across his brow.\n\nSo limp have his side’s first-half showings been over the last month that he must have his half-time admonishments preprepared and polished by now. At Leicester in the League Cup in midweek they had sparked a revival but there was to be no riposte here.

In the space of eight days, Manchester United have suffered three successive defeats that have provided an unwelcome reality check at a time when their rivals across the city are blazing a trail at the top of the Premier League.\n\nJosé Mourinho: some Manchester United players not coping with pressure Read more\n\nMaybe breaking the transfer record, signing Zlatan Ibrahimovic and appointing José Mourinho will not suddenly put everything right at United.\n\nMourinho claimed that he never got carried away in the first place, yet deep down the United manager must be alarmed to see how things have unravelled.\n\nHe pointed the finger at the officials after this chastening defeat at Watford and claimed that United had been on the wrong end of poor decisions against Manchester City and Feyenoord, too. However, there was also an acknowledgement that improvement has to come from within. Mourinho talked about how “some individuals probably feel too much pressure” and also highlighted the defensive vulnerability that an impressive Watford side brutally exposed.\n\nLuke Shaw’s part in Watford’s second goal was singled out, with the United manager frustrated that the left-back had sat back rather than pressed more aggressively prior to Juan Camilo Zúñiga restoring the home team’s lead, yet there were plenty of other issues to address on an afternoon when Mourinho’s side finished the game looking ragged and disjointed.\n\nWayne Rooney, who was a picture of frustration throughout, finally took things too far in injury time and was booked for dissent by the referee, Michael Oliver. More misery was to follow for United a couple of minutes later when Marouane Fellaini tripped Zúñiga, giving Troy Deeney the chance to convert from the spot. His penalty was emphatic and sealed Watford’s first victory over United since September 1986.\n\nWhile Mourinho was entitled to claim United looked the more likely team to win once Marcus Rashford had equalised, this was a far from convincing performance and too many players were on the periphery of the game. Paul Pogba hit the crossbar with a dipping shot in the first half but never did enough to impose himself and, rightly or wrongly, it is hard not to look at the Frenchman and expect so much more from the world’s most expensive footballer.\n\nIbrahimovic only came alive in the second half, when he had a hand in Rashford’s goal and also drew a superb save from Heurelho Gomes with a far-post header. Before that the Swede looked flat, much like the rest of a team who were fortunate not to concede long before Capoue’s opener.\n\nWatford caught them cold and started superbly. The unmarked Sebastian Prödl headed narrowly wide just before Odion Ighalo filed an early contender for miss of the season. It was a chance that came about following a breakdown in communication between David de Gea and Chris Smalling. Both players challenged for the same high ball, De Gea was unable to gather cleanly and Ighalo inexplicably sliced wide with the goal yawning invitingly in front of him.\n\nThe home team carved open a third chance when Daryl Janmaat swung in a cross that Deeney, towering above Antonio Valencia, met with a powerful header that De Gea clawed away one-handed. There were only 17 minutes gone and it was tempting to wonder when United would grab hold of the game. They improved in that brief period when Pogba hit the woodwork but Watford continued to look dangerous and it was no surprise when Capoue scored.\n\nWhether the goal should have been allowed to stand is a different matter.\n\nMiguel Britos dispossessed Anthony Martial deep on the United left but seemed to foul the Frenchman before getting to the ball. Oliver, however, waved play on and with United exposed on their left flank, Janmaat escaped and produced the perfect cut-back for Capoue, who dispatched a low shot past De Gea to register his fourth goal in five league games.\n\nMartial remained on the ground and was clearly in some distress following an incident that happened seven minutes earlier when he clashed heads with Janmaat. The United forward was unable to continue and questions will be asked as to whether he should have come back on to the pitch in the first place.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Étienne Capoue opens the scoring for Watford. Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Reuters\n\nMourinho sought to change things by replacing Valencia with Juan Mata and two minutes later United were level. Ibrahimovic exchanged passes with Rashford and sent a cross that dropped at the England international’s feet after bouncing off Valon Behrami. Swinging his left boot at the ball, Rashford made no mistake.\n\nAndros Townsend shines as Crystal Palace overrun demoralised Stoke Read more\n\nAlthough United were now on top and could have grabbed a winner but for Gomes’s save from Ibrahimovic, Watford deserve credit for refusing to settle for a point. Whatever Mourinho’s misgivings about Shaw’s defending, it was a lovely move down the Watford right involving Nordin Amrabat and Roberto Pereyra that created the chance for Zúñiga to beat De Gea only 53 seconds after coming off the bench.\n\nFellaini’s foul on the same player enabled Deeney to add a third Watford goal and follow up the win at West Ham United with an even more eye-catching result. “I’m happy for the fans,” Watford’s manager, Walter Mazzarri, said. “They told me it was 30 years since Watford have beaten Manchester United, so this win gives us a lot of satisfaction.”"}, {"date":

at the foot of the table for long but, with each thrashing they endure, the creeping sense of crisis grips tighter. This was a second successive drubbing to the tune of four goals conceded, a rout inflicted by a Crystal Palace team who have been accused so often of being obliging hosts. But, whereas they have now forced their way into the top half Stoke shudder under the weight of the division.\n\nThis was grim viewing for Mark Hughes and worse for the visiting fans left disgusted in the Arthur Wait stand. A team who have been rightly praised for transforming their attacking style, learning to flourish in possession, appear to have forgotten the basics in defensive organisation. Where once they were strong, aggressive and thoroughly drilled, now their back line was ramshackle and confidence brittle throughout. By the end it was shattered.\n\nThey shipped three goals from set-pieces here, probably should have conceded more with a soft underbelly exposed and were tormented from flank to centre by the energy of Palace’s front five. Andros Townsend ran amok, eventually enjoying personal reward by curling in a sumptuous first goal for the club, and the home side’s fourth of the afternoon, from distance as all semblance of resistance evaporated. “We knew if we started fast, got in behind them and got crosses in, we’d be a threat,” said Townsend. That seemed basic, but it worked. Stoke never coped with his trickery or that of Wilfried Zaha on the opposite flank.\n\nChristian Benteke may not have scored himself but his mere presence unnerved Stoke at set pieces, permitting both centre-halves to register goals in the first quarter-hour. Throw in Jason Puncheon’s wicked delivery, whether from dead-ball situations or open play, and the industry of the outstanding James McArthur and Palace were irrepressible. “We lost [Yannick ] Bolasie and James at around the same stage last season, both big blows and, to be honest, I don’t know which one was the bigger loss,” said Alan Pardew. “James gives an energy and assurance that we miss when he’s not there. He was excellent.”\n\nThe same glowing tributes could be paid to players up and down his selection, and almost none of those in Stoke colours. This was a wretched display, typified by a troubling blend of carelessness and panic at the back. They were breached twice within 134 seconds early on, concessions which set the tone, with both utterly avoidable. James Tomkins should surely have been better tracked at Townsend’s early free-kick, looped beyond Shay Given to the far post, but Jonathan Walters could only end up prodding goalwards from point-blank range in his desperation to intercept. Tomkins celebrated the gift with a touch.\n\nJust as inexcusable was the free run permitted Scott Dann moments later, the defender thumping his header down and through a Stoke player on the line. It would take Bojan’s nod from the line to deny Dann a second after the interval with the visitors’ dopiness still evident. If they had hoped to mount a recovery, then a failure to clear Puncheon’s free-kick – another conceded needlessly by Marko Arnautovic – 19 minutes from time scuppered their aspirations. McArthur was permitted to collect, cut inside and curl a shot that deflected in off Geoff Cameron. In truth, it was only Given’s smart save from Zaha’s backheel and a series of lunged blocks from a rearguard permanently at breaking point that prevented the home side running up a cricket score.\n\nIn that context it was hard to pluck positives from the wreckage. Hughes could point to Arnautovic’s emphatic finish beyond Steve Mandanda in stoppage time, providing only his team’s third league goal of season, but the sloppiness had been as much in evidence among his forward thinkers. Bojan, still striving for full fitness, was peripheral. Wilfried Bony is a player still adjusting to new surroundings, with plenty of his shooting wildly inaccurate for all that it took a smart tackle from Damien Delaney to deny him a second-half tap in. Walters, too, missed a presentable opportunity after the contest had been surrendered.\n\nNone of that amounted to grounds for much optimism. Instead Hughes was left drawing some kind of hope from his team’s recovery from last year’s disappointing opening, when they had accrued three points from six Premier League games. Their run of games ahead does, indeed, look encouraging but this is a team who have just subsided at Selhurst Park. They are not building from any proper platform, other than the memory of how well they have done in the last three seasons.\n\n“Clearly we didn’t have a strong start last year too and turned it round,” said Hughes. “We have to be more solid and resolute but we’ve got a decent dressing room and experienced players who know how to win Premier League games. At some point that will come to the fore.”\n\nPardew had attempted to dissuade the home support from taunting his opposite number with their chorus of “You’re getting sacked in the morning” before the end. It has not quite come to that yet but Hughes will be the first to recognise that much of this was unacceptable.\n\nCrystal Palace 4-1 Stoke City: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest James Tomkins celebrates scoring his side’s first goal on his full Premier League debut for Crystal Palace.

Charlie Austin’s second league goal for the club was enough to condemn Swansea City to defeat and shake off any unwelcome records, namely the thought of the Frenchman failing to win any of his opening five league matches. Saints ditched another unwanted statistic too, securing their first clean sheet in 17 top-flight matches, largely thanks to Fraser Forster’s giant right hand denying Gylfi Sigurdsson a late equaliser.\n\nPuel, who replaced Ronald Koeman in the summer, may just have learned his lesson. His Southampton side were supposed to be invigorated by their Europa League win over Sparta Prague – their first of the season – in midweek but they took an age to get out of first gear here.

Strikers can score at the beginning but also later in the game. I think it was a good decision.”\n\nSouthampton started slowly, as the Swansea winger Mo Barrow began to stretch his legs, drawing fouls from Davis and Shane Long. But slowly Saints awoke, eventually gaining control of a drab affair, Van Dijk forcing a smart save from Lukasz Fabianski, after his header from Davis’s corner, while Long’s frustrations were compounded when he was booked for diving by Mike Jones, after fishing for a foul from Federico Fernández inside the box.\n\nNathan Redmond, compared to Thierry Henry by Puel on the eve of the season, spurned Southampton’s best chances as Austin, who scored twice against Sparta, looked on from the sidelines. Given another audition to impress as a false nine, the winger-cum-striker Redmond fluffed his lines. Dusan Tadic – again one of Saints’ better performers – knocked the ball past the left-back Stephen Kingsley, before sliding the ball across to Redmond, who checked inside before driving his effort high over the bar. It was not exactly Row Z but frustrated home supporters began to sing the name of Austin.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Nathan Redmond fires over during a disappointing display.

He’s a very good player with many possibilities, now it’s just a question of time and experience. It’s not a problem, it’s important he stays with a good attitude.”\n\nKingsley was replaced by Angel Rangel at half-time with Kyle Naughton switching flanks, something of a testament to Tadic’s display. It was Naughton’s interception that proved vital three minutes into the second half, when the defender cleared Long’s effort off the line. The striker was out of luck again less than 60 seconds later, tapping home from close range after the offside flag was raised.\n\nAustin was then called upon – replacing Long – and the script was already written. Jordi Amat, the Swansea defender, failed to properly deal with Tadic’s cross, slicing the ball into the path of Austin, who ensured the net rippled emphatically. Francesco Guidolin introduced Swansea’s £15.5m record signing, Borja Bastón, and Sigurdsson’s low shot tested Forster late on but the visitors still lacked a cutting edge.\n\nFor Swansea, the task does not get any easier, with two matches against a seemingly untouchable Manchester City on the horizon. “I am worried because if we play in this way in the Premier League, it’s difficult to win any game,” said Guidolin. “I am thinking to change something. We have to think game-by-game but we have to improve. The opponents are important but our attitude has to change.”\n\nKi Sung-yueng shrugged his shoulders and walked past his Italian manager after being substituted, a week after Neil Taylor, left out of Swansea’s 18-man squad at St Mary’s, showed his frustration at being taken off during the first half against Chelsea. “It’s not a good attitude. I have to speak with him because I respect all people, all of my players because the relationship is important,” said Guidolin of Ki’s actions. Taylor, meanwhile, is expected to feature in the EFL Cup on Wednesday. “I have found good, good guys in this squad. My relationship with the players is no problem.” Regardless of Guidolin’s words, it does not look too promising for Swansea."}, {"date": "18/09/2016", "arena": "White Hart Lane", "attendance": 31251, "home_team": {"name": "Tottenham Hotspur", "lineup": [{"name": "Hugo Lloris", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Walker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eric Dier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [77]}, {"name": "Toby Alderweireld", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jan Vertonghen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Wanyama", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mousa Dembélé", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [74]}, {"name": "Moussa Sissoko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dele Alli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Heung-Min Son", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Kane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [59], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [87]}], "subs": [{"name": "Vincent Janssen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [87], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Erik Lamela", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [74], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michel Vorm", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kieran Trippier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Eriksen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Winks", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Davies", "yellows": [84], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [77], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Sunderland", "lineup": [{"name": "Jordan Pickford", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jason Denayer", "yellows": [57], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Lamine Koné", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Papy Djilobodji", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Javi Manquillo", "yellows": [44], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Didier Ndong", "yellows": [65], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jan Kirchhoff", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [79]}, {"name": "Lee Cattermole", "yellows": [62], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adnan Januzaj", "yellows": [81], "reds": [90], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jermain Defoe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Pienaar", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [63]}], "subs": [{"name": "Wahbi Khazri", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [79], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Mika", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Duncan Watmore", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [63], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John O'Shea", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paddy McNair", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Donald Love", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lynden Gooch", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Tottenham Hotspur nudged up to third in the Premier League with a tight, hard-fought, somehow oddly inevitable 1-0 defeat of Sunderland. Harry Kane scored the only goal but was taken off on a stretcher just before the end with a nasty twist of the ankle, a moment that may prove more significant than three points gathered against muscular but cautious opponents who had only two shots on target all game.\n\nDavid Moyes’s team came to White Hart Lane to defend and did so well enough for 58 minutes until a slip from Papy Djilobodji gave the ball to Kane in front of goal. He had time to take a touch and side-foot into the corner to break a White Hart Lane goal-blank stretching back to March.\n\nMauricio Pochettino was happy with the win after a gruelling week, less so with the injury to a player who is so vital to the rhythms of his team. “It’s for this that we signed Vincent [Janssen] who has been doing very well. He’s a striker who can give us other options,” Pochettino said. But the fact is Spurs have been slightly winging it when it comes to backup for their main man. Currently no other senior striker at the club has actually scored for the first team. Eric Dier and Mousa Dembélé also picked up slight knocks but both should be fit for the trip to Middlesbrough on Saturday.\n\nFor Sunderland this was a fourth defeat in five that leaves them listing along joint‑bottom of the table and Moyes still looking – although not, on this evidence, with that much urgency – for his first victory. Moyes had suggested that there might be some intangible mental weakness behind his team’s poor start, even an indefinable “something” that goes beyond rational explanation: a bad vibe, a hex, a shadow.\n\nManchester United stunned as Watford are spot-on with late show Read more\n\nDefending properly, as Sunderland did here for the opening 45 minutes, might be one way of shifting that mysterious cloud. Offering a little more adventure might be another. Not least against opponents who did seem vulnerable when Sunderland committed Adnan Januzaj and Steven Pienaar forward in support of the rather lonesome Jermain Defoe, who had a total of 13 touches all game. Sunderland might have even gone to half-time 1-0 up had Pienaar been able to beat Kyle Walker on the line – as he really should – after good work from Januzaj on the break.\n\nIt was a rare attack from the blancmange-coloured shirts on a grey north London afternoon, with the piles of displaced earth and the huge steel armature of the new stadium now rising above the open corner at one end. Spurs were dominant from the start, pressing down the flanks but finding no way past the athletic and assertive Jordan Pickford.\n\nPochettino has spoken of the need to find other gears, other ways of playing and here he changed the texture of his midfield, bringing in Dembélé, Moussa Sissoko and Victor Wanyama, with Dier dropping into the back four and Jan Vertonghen shifting to left-back. Dembélé in particular has been missed during his ban; a midfielder with muscle as well as craft, able to pass, dribble and keep the ball.\n\nSpurs started with purpose, Son Heung-min – who played well throughout – flashing the ball across the face of goal after a driving run. Jason Denayer was a late inclusion in Sunderand’s XI after Patrick van Aanholt withdrew for unspecified reasons. Understandably, he struggled for a while against Son on his Premier League debut. Kane drew a smart near-post block from Pickford after Son’s low cross. Later Son cut inside and spanked a shot on to the foot of the post.\n\nSunderland rarely pushed across halfway but they began to offer a little space after half-time as Dele Alli moved nicely across the front line. It was Alli’s skip across the box that made space for Dembélé to play a lovely little pass to Son, whose shot billowed the side netting. And moments later Sunderland finally blinked. Walker swung a high cross in from the right, Alli nodded down and Djilobodji made a horrible attempt to control on his chest, deflecting the ball to Kane.\n\nWith the game drifting away Moyes abandoned the deep-lying trench defence, with Duncan Watmore providing some gambolling menace down the right. Januzaj was sent off for a second yellow in the 89th minute. Spurs might have scored again, but could not find the final pass. Janssen’s wild blast over the bar in stoppage time was fitting end to a slightly fretful match."}, {"date": "17/09/2016", "arena": "KCOM Stadium", "attendance": 22536, "home_team": {"name": "Hull City", "lineup": [{"name": "Eldin Jakupovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ahmed Elmohamady", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jake Livermore", "yellows": [], "reds": [40], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Curtis Davies", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andrew Robertson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Huddlestone", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [58]}, {"name": "Samuel Clucas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Meyler", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robert Snodgrass", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [79], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Abel Hernandez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [77]}, {"name": "Adama Diomande", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [42]}], "subs": [{"name": "Harry Maguire", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [42], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shaun Maloney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dieumerci Mbokani", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [77], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Will Keane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Markus Henriksen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Marshall", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Mason", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [58], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Arsenal", "lineup": [{"name": "Petr Cech", "yellows": [78], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Hector Bellerin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shkodran Mustafi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Laurent Koscielny", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nacho Monreal", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Francis Coquelin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Santi Cazorla", "yellows": [34], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [67]}, {"name": "Theo Walcott", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [55], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [88]}, {"name": "Mesut Özil", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex Iwobi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [77]}, {"name": "Alexis Sánchez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [17, 83], "missed_pens": [41], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Kieran Gibbs", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lucas Pérez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [88], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Ospina", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rob Holding", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Granit Xhaka", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [90], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [67], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mohamed Elneny", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [77], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Alexis Sánchez scored twice but Theo Walcott and Alex Iwobi were the real masterminds behind this deconstruction of Hull City. Heavily involved in Arsenal’s first three goals – and scoring the second himself – Walcott looked very much a winger in form on an afternoon when, despite Sam Clucas’s impressive efforts in Mike Phelan’s midfield, home hopes were wrecked by Jake Livermore’s 40th-minute dismissal.\n\nNacer Chadli’s double helps West Brom romp to 4-2 win over West Ham Read more\n\n“A convincing performance,” said a beaming Arsène Wenger, celebrating a third straight Premier League win. “At the start of the season we weren’t physically ready, we are now.”\n\nAfter Wenger had rightly lauded Iwobi’s “exceptional quality” and Walcott’s “efficiency,” a sunny Phelan revealed some good news of his own. “My future’s quite bright, I think,” said Hull’s interim manager, explaining that he has been offered a new contract that would remove the interim aspect of that job title. “I’ll discuss it further on Monday,” he said. “Once we’ve sorted out the details I’ll make a decision but I’m getting an opportunity to be the manager.”\n\nStarting deceptively slowly, Wenger’s side barely had a chance before Sánchez gave them a 17th-minute lead when Eldin Jakupovic’s weak parry of Walcott’s cross fell conveniently to Iwobi, whose shot took a hefty deflection off Sánchez’s heel.\n\nUntil then it had been very much the Curtis Davies show, with Phelan’s centre-half looking England class as he ran through an impressive repertoire of blocks and interceptions.\n\nEncouragingly for Phelan, Hull at times manoeuvred the ball every bit as adroitly as Arsenal, with Clucas, not so long ago a lower division journeyman, appearing anything but out of place.\n\nWhen Arsenal endeavoured to up the tempo, Tom Huddlestone proved extremely adept at slowing it right back down and, up until the goal, Jakupovic rarely found himself under threat.\n\nInevitably, the balance of power shifted following Sánchez’s opener and it would have tilted even further against Hull had Mesut Özil not squandered an excellent chance to make it two in the wake of Jakupovic performing wonders to repel Iwobi’s shot.\n\nFor all the home side’s pleasing passing they rarely succeeded in getting behind Wenger’s defence. It did not help that Robert Snodgrass, so often their inspiration in recent weeks, seemed in danger of suffocation, so tightly was he being marked by Nacho Monreal. When the winger did finally escape Monreal’s clutches he shot straight at an otherwise under-employed Petr Cech.\n\nIn contrast, Jakupovic was increasingly busy, showing his calibre by saving a Sánchez penalty shortly before half-time. Awarded after Livermore was shown a red card for handling Francis Coquelin’s goalbound shot –created by yet another Walcott cross – it was far from a copybook 12-yard kick but Jakupovic still reacted superbly.\n\n“I don’t think it was a deliberate handball,” said Phelan as Arsenal fans wondered why Santi Cazorla, Wenger’s first-choice penalty taker, had not stepped forward. “I think it was ball to hand.”\n\nArsenal initially made heavy weather of capitalising on the numerical advantage but, emphasising that this was very much his afternoon, Walcott eventually ensured Wenger could relax a little.\n\nConnecting with Iwobi’s fabulous backheel flick the winger unleashed a clipped, rising, angled, shot that was helped on its journey by Harry Maguire’s head. Attempting a last-ditch clearance, the substitute ended up in despairing mode but, even without his intervention, it would surely have gone in and was claimed by Walcott.\n\nManchester City and Kevin De Bruyne roll on with Bournemouth thumping Read more\n\nCreditably, Hull refused to fold and Snodgrass reduced the deficit courtesy of an assuredly struck left-footed penalty given following Cech’s felling of Dieumerci Mbokani after his connection with his fellow substitute Ryan Mason’s fine through pass. Phelan felt a little hard done by to see Cech merely booked but accepted the referee was conforming to the latest laws.\n\nHull briefly looked capable of snatching a point only for Walcott – who else? – to shatter such illusions as Jakupovic could merely push his shot in the direction of the hovering Sánchez, who responded by lashing the ball high into the net. It was the Chilean’s sixth goal in five games against Hull.\n\nLast but not least, Granit Xhaka sent a 90th-minute, 30-yard, left-foot shot dipping and swerving viciously into the top corner.

It also gives them some confidence after the first four league games of the season had produced four points.\n\nClaudio Ranieri, whose saying “Dilly ding, dilly dong” has now been turned into a song to the tune of Yellow Submarine by Leicester fans, said he was very pleased with the result, and the decisive manner in which it was achieved. “It was important to win again after the Champions League victory and against a good team, a very well organised team,”he said. “To score at the end of the first and beginning of second half made it much better for us and after that we controlled the game. It was a good performance for Slimani, but good for everybody.”\n\nThe club’s record signing, for £29m from Sporting Lisbon, Slimani received the loudest cheer from a raucous crowd when the teams were read out. The Algerian, tall, rangy and powerful, took their cue and looked to get off on the front foot, creating the first chance of the match for Marc Albrighton in the second minute, but the winger’s cutback was blocked.\n\nFor much of the opening stages, however, there was not much between the sides. Leicester were struggling to pull off the quick, direct combinations necessary to break down the well-drilled visitors. The Burnley manager, Sean Dyche, said: “If you were a fan of football you’d have thought ‘There’s not a lot between these teams.’”\n\nThen came the spell either side of half-time that Dyche described as four minutes of madness.\n\nThe game had looked like it might trickle out to half-time only for Albrighton to draw a needless foul from Burnley right-back, Matthew Lowton, in the first minute of added time. Albrighton dummied the free-kick and allowed Christian Fuchs to drive the ball across superbly and find Slimani, who had ghosted beyond his man and headed home from six yards.\n\nAt the restart, the game was still in the balance and Leicester needed more from Slimani, as well as Jamie Vardy and Riyad Mahrez. The talented trio duly obliged within three minutes. Mahrez won possession in the middle of the park and bore down on goal. He found enough room to escape the attentions of Stephen Ward and put in a cross. The ball deflected behind Vardy, but the England striker is never one to decline an invitation to improvise and he flicked the ball beyond him with his heel to the back post where Slimani was waiting once again. He produced a firm header and the lead was doubled.\n\nFrom this point, Leicester were happy to sit back and Dyche tried to shake things up, going 4-4-2 with the addition of Sam Vokes and the Iceland winger Johann Berg Gudmundsson. Sadly for Dyche, his switch did not result in Burnley having any more of the ball. Instead, and without really having to try, Leicester wrapped up the match. Once again Mahrez was up against Ward and able to cut the ball low across the six-yard box, but while no blue shirt was anywhere near making a connection, Mee still felt the need to intercept and turned the ball into his own net in so doing.\n\nDyche was full of praise for Mee and partner in central defence, Michael Keane, determined to keep the confidence of his young English duo up. “He was excellent, really high quality, and Keane dug in alongside him,” he said.\n\n“There’s no particular blame attached to him for that goal, but from a defensive point of view we know you can’t make the errors that we did in this match.\n\n“You get punished for a lot at this level and the hardest challenge for me is to try to win enough games to stay up while also developing the players.\n\n“It’s that assuredness that you need to thrive in the Premier League. It’s not just about tactics and technical ability, it’s about mentality, that belief you can walk in a stadium and play with authority. It’s breaking out into that, an inner belief. It’s not far away, but the margins are tight about how a mentality grows over time.”\n\nRanieri knows all about growing a mentality and he will feel his Foxes are back in the hunt.\n\nAlexis Sánchez

there.\n\nThis was an eighth win from an eighth outing in all competitions, a club-record start to a campaign. The football was sublime and made to look simple and to listen to the weekly exhortations from their perfection-seeking manager there is far more to come.\n\nBy the time Ilkay Gündogan scored to make it 4-0 and goal No25 already this season there were still 24 minutes remaining and if Eddie Howe could have throw in the towel in he may have considered it.\n\nAlexis Sánchez and Theo Walcott ensure Arsenal sink 10-man Hull Read more\n\nThat finish by Gündogan came from the latest assist from the sublime Kevin De Bruyne, who yet again showed what a footballer he is on a day when he opened the scoring and had a hand in the other three goals.\n\nDe Bruyne is one of the more luminescent lights in this sparkling side and of the talents he has managed Guardiola puts the Belgian below only Lionel Messi. “Messi is alone,” the coach said. “On a table beside Kevin can sit. He is a special player. Without ball the first fighter and with it he seems clear. He makes right decisions every single time. We are so lucky that we have Kevin with us. It was a fantastic performance.”\n\nKelechi Iheanacho agreed. “Kevin is a brilliant player,” said the centre-forward. “He is very intelligent. He has good qualities. We are happy to have him in our team.”\n\nHowe was left to reflect on a sobering afternoon. “It was a tough day,” the Bournemouth manager said. “We had some good counterattack opportunities and didn’t make the most of them. There were moments when we did OK, but they weren’t enough. We turned the ball over too much, particularly in the first half.”\n\nAs is becoming the custom under Guardiola, City raced into an early advantage and after 25 minutes they were 2-0 ahead and the contest already appeared over. Last Saturday De Bruyne opened the scoring in the derby win and helped create Iheanacho’s winner. Now came a similar act.\n\nDe Bruyne’s second strike of this nascent season came courtesy of a quicksilver brain. When he stood over a free-kick from around 20 yards out and to the left of Artur Boruc’s goal a regulation shot or cross seemed the options. Instead, the midfielder hit the ball low and with cunning to aim it under the wall with an effort that beat Boruc to his right.\n\nThis made it seven games from eight when City have scored within the opening half-hour and if De Bruyne’s first was refreshing for its left-field quality, their second was equally as enjoyable. This time the Belgian roved forward and fed Raheem Sterling along his right-hand corridor. The England man passed to Iheanacho, who turned in for a second finish in two weekends.\n\nSlimani opens his account with a double as Leicester ease past Burnley Read more\n\nThe slickly oiled machine that is Guardiola’s City now purred along in high gear. As the break neared this time Iheanacho showed the intelligence by laying a chance on for Sterling. The 21-year-old let fly with his left foot and should have scored but Boruc was able to save.\n\nAt the break City were coasting and Guardiola’s message may have been just to keep on keeping on. For this fifth league outing he named Vincent Kompany in the squad for the first time, the captain a substitute along with John Stones, who was replaced in central defence by Aleksandar Kolarov.\n\nWhile the Serb partnered Nicolás Otamendi and Gündogan made a Premier League bow, Jack Wilshere was given a full Bournemouth debut by Howe, the Arsenal loanee playing as the No10.\n\nAs Wilshere observed City’s pinball-wizardry pass him by, did he wonder what-might-have-been regarding the proposed move here? He may have stepped out for the second half determined to wrest the game from City’s grasp but within three minutes it was 3-0 and this threatened to become embarrassing for Wilshere and team‑mates.\n\nDe Bruyne (again), Iheanacho (again) and Sterling (again) were all involved. The Belgian ran toward goal, slid a pass into the Nigerian, and when the ball was rolled towards City’s No7 Sterling made no mistake.\n\nNow came a rousing rendition of Blue Moon, the club anthem, from the deliriously happy supporters. This was followed by loud applause for Gündogan and De Bruyne, when each was later taken off.\n\nAfter Gündogan’s finish the sole sour note for City was Nolito’s red card near the end for aiming (and missing) a butt at Adam Smith. Given how the side are playing, Nolito will fear for his starting berth while suspended for the next three games – the league trips to Swansea City and Tottenham Hotspur, plus Wednesday’s League Cup tie also at Swansea.\n\nGuardiola seemed to reluctantly agree the forward should be sent off. “The referee took a decision and we have to accept that,” he said.\n\nAt the moment City and their fans are living in a Guardiola-wonderland.

At the moment there seems only one answer."}, {"date": "17/09/2016", "arena": "The Hawthorns", "attendance": 22209, "home_team": {"name": "West Bromwich Albion", "lineup": [{"name": "Ben Foster", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Craig Dawson", "yellows": [43], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gareth McAuley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonny Evans", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Brendan Galloway", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [68]}, {"name": "Darren Fletcher", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Claudio Yacob", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matt Phillips", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nacer Chadli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [8, 56], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [75]}, {"name": "James McClean", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [44], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Salomón Rondón", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [37], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [87]}], "subs": [{"name": "Allan Nyom", "yellows": [86], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [68], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonas Olsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Morrison", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [75], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Craig Gardner", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Boaz Myhill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Saido Berahino", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Hal Robson-Kanu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [87], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "West Ham United", "lineup": [{"name": "Adrián", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Håvard Nordtveit", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Collins", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Angelo Ogbonna", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Arthur Masuaku", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [77]}, {"name": "Mark Noble", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Cheikhou Kouyaté", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michail Antonio", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [61], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Manuel Lanzini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [65], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dimitri Payet", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Simone Zaza", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}], "subs": [{"name": "Darren Randolph", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sofiane Feghouli", "yellows": [86], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pedro Obiang", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gökhan Töre", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Fletcher", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [77], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonathan Calleri", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Reece Oxford", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "A new era at West Bromwich Albion began in entertaining style as a 4-2 home win against West Ham helped ease speculation about Tony Pulis’s future. Instead pressure builds on his opposite number, Slaven Bilic, who admitted feeling embarrassed at half-time, and said: “We are weak and we have a problem.”\n\nHull City v Arsenal, Manchester City v Bournemouth and more: football clockwatch – live! Read more\n\nIn the first game since Thursday’s announcement that West Brom’s takeover by Chinese group Yunyi Guokai Sports Development Limited – led by Lai Guochuan – had been completed, defeat might have left Pulis, with speculation surrounding his future before kick-off, on the brink of an exit.\n\nDuring last weekend’s defeat at Bournemouth, Albion fans derided the general quality of Tony Pulis’s football in song, but no such criticism could be levelled on Saturday. It was left to Bilic to lament defensive lapses as West Brom surged into a four-goal lead through a penalty from Nacer Chadli, who was superb on his home debut, Salomón Rondón, James McClean and Chadli once more finding the target.\n\nWest Ham, who have now conceded 11 goals in their last three Premier League matches, replied with Michail Antonio’s header and a Manuel Lanzini penalty but never looked like completing the unlikely comeback.\n\nBilic said: “I don’t like to hide behind mistakes, they happen, and I don’t like to use the same language as I used after the game. But the key word is again – it’s happened again. The defending is not as required in a league like the Premier League. You can’t expect to get anything, make a comeback or anything like that, when you are 3-0 down at half-time – and then 4-0 down. It is a difficult spell and to be honest at half-time I felt embarrassed. At half-time it was a very bad feeling.”\n\nThe Baggies were on the front foot from the first whistle. Within the opening minute Matt Phillips whipped a dangerous cross into the West Ham penalty area, the ball just eluding Rondón before McClean worked Adrián in the away goal with a low shot.\n\nAlexis Sánchez and Theo Walcott ensure Arsenal sink 10-man Hull Read more\n\nThe home side were soon rewarded for their positive start after the ball struck the French defender Arthur Masuaku’s arm following a tackle on Phillips. The award of a free-kick seemed harsh, and the referee’s assistant deemed it accidental, but Mark Clattenburg awarded the foul.\n\nFrom Phillips’s resulting far-post cross, there was little doubt over another handball incident, with Arthur Masuaku clearly at fault. West Brom’s club-record signing Chadli coolly converted the resulting penalty.\n\nThe Hammers enjoyed much of the ball following the goal but never really worried West Brom until Lanzini’s shot from the right-hand side of the penalty area narrowly flew past the far post in the 34th minute.\n\nImmediately afterwards, Dimitri Payet picked out Antonio with a lovely clipped pass but Ben Foster raced out to block his shot at point-blank range.\n\nSlimani opens his account with a double as Leicester ease past Burnley Read more\n\nThat was as good as it got for West Ham during the first half and West Brom extended their lead after 37 minutes when Chadli teed up Rondón and his shot through James Collins’s legs flew into the bottom corner of the net.\n\nA third goal came before half-time and Chadli was involved again as his shot was turned in by the alert McClean from six yards out. Bilic responded with two changes at the break, bringing on Sofiane Feghouli and Jonathan Calleri with the captain Mark Noble and Simone Zaza, largely anonymous in the first half, making way. But it got worse for the Hammers, with the home side going further in front after 56 minutes.\n\nMasuaku was at fault once more as his low cross was cut out by Darren Fletcher who set Rondón, at this point midway inside his own half, clean through on goal. Chadli made a fine run to support the Venezuelan, who unselfishly set him up for a tap-in inside the penalty area.\n\nAt 4-0 down it looked like game over but West Ham responded with two goals in four minutes – “We’re not used to being 4-0 up,” said Pulis’s deputy, Dave Kemp. First Antonio headed home a cross from Payet and then, in the 65th minute, Payet was brought down by Brendan Galloway and Clattenburg pointed to the penalty spot. Ben Foster dived the right way but Lanzini’s spot-kick was well-placed in the bottom corner.\n\nPulis, speaking to West Brom’s website, said: “If you lose games it gives a bad taste to the supporters. The supporters have a right to express their opinions.\n\n“It’s come together today but it’s only five games and the important thing is that we take the good out of today and take it on to Stoke next week.”"}, {"date": "17/09/2016", "arena": "Goodison Park", "attendance": 39074, "home_team": {"name": "Everton", "lineup": [{"name": "Maarten Stekelenburg", "yellows": [22], "reds": [], "own_goals":

to adversity in the past but there is steel running through the side under Ronald Koeman. They went behind to the most dubious of away goals midway through the first half but simply brushed the injustice aside, recovered within minutes and went on to claim a handsome victory. Everton now sit second in the table and have scored six goals in their last two games, though it must be said Middlesbrough, like Sunderland earlier in the week, do not possess the most resolute of defences.\n\n“Our start was not good,” Koeman said. “We needed to be more aggressive with the pressing but we got there in the end and played some great football. We have improved a lot physically and we have brought in players with a lot of energy.”\n\nGareth Barry enjoyed an eventful evening as he made his 600th Premier League appearance, only the third player to record such a milestone after Ryan Giggs and Frank Lampard. The Everton vice-captain could have gifted Middlesbrough an opening goal when he lost the ball in front of his own penalty area, and was relieved when Gastón Ramírez proved to be less sharp at shooting than dispossessing opponents.\n\nManchester City and Kevin De Bruyne roll on with Bournemouth thumping Read more\n\nSix minutes later the visitors did take an unexpected lead, and Barry led the posse of Everton players moaning about it. In fairness he probably had a point, Álvaro Negredo’s goal should not have stood. Replays showed the Boro striker headed Maarten Stekelenburg’s arm rather than the ball as the pair tried to claim George Friend’s cross from the left touchline, thus preventing the goalkeeper making a clean catch. Lee Mason did not have the benefit of replays, however, and awarded the goal, presumably on the grounds that Negredo only attacked the ball and did not appear to have committed any obvious foul.\n\nOne imagines Barry was making the point a little too forcibly that in such situations goalkeepers are normally given the benefit of the doubt. In a way it was refreshing to find a referee unwilling to treat goalkeepers as a protected species, and possibly true that Negredo also deserved the benefit of the doubt, though had the referee had the opportunity to watch a replay he would have been forced to change his mind.\n\nIf the occasion was turning a little sour Barry lost no time in making amends. A mere three minutes after going behind Everton were level, and it was Barry at the far post who provided the equaliser. Víctor Valdés punched ineffectively at a Kevin Mirallas corner, succeeding only in pushing the ball against Negredo, from whom it fell to Barry to tuck away with a neat finish, though once again there was an element of controversy. Valdés might have dealt with the cross better had not Ashley Williams impeded the goalkeeper by going for the ball with a raised boot.\n\nRoss Barkley and Yannick Bolasie both went close for the home side once the scores were level before Everton hit two goals in quick succession to turn round 3-1 in front, a half-time scoreline that little in the previous 45 minutes had suggested. Séamus Coleman scored the first, accepting a short pass from Romelu Lukaku and coolly rounding Daniel Ayala in the Boro area to make his shooting angle easier, then in the final second of added time Lukaku himself added another. At least the striker claimed the goal, in reality it appeared he had merely stretched out a leg to Bolasie’s cross and made negligible contact. Bolasie had just as strong a claim to the goal, though Lukaku could claim with some justification that it was his action that had diverted the attention of the goalkeeper. Barry’s day become even more eventful with a booking at the end of the first half, after an altercation with Ramírez.\n\nBoro became the second north-east team in a week to be floored by Everton’s ability to score bursts of goals, and the second half was basically a story of a team full of confidence passing the ball at will around a defence more interested in damage limitation. Barkley was conspicuous in most home attacks after his dressing down at Sunderland, clearly focused on correcting the impression that he gives the ball away too cheaply.\n\nThere were occasions, in fact, when Barkley might have done better to release the ball a little earlier, though one determined run into the box after an hour brought a good save from Valdés at the foot of his left hand post.\n\n“Today was the Ross Barkley we like to see,” Koeman said. “He’s not a young player any more, he needs to take responsibility. I was honest in what I said about him, but players are not stupid, they know when they have not played well.”\n\nBarkley would have liked a goal to mark his rehabilitation, yet though always in control, Everton seemed to lose their attacking focus once Lukaku was withdrawn. Enner Valencia made his debut, without managing to decorate it with any contribution of note.\n\n“We lost our concentration at the end of the first half but apart from that Everton had to play well to beat us,” Aitor Karanka said. “They are a good side, better than us. I think many teams night have lost that game by five or six goals to one.”"}, {"date": "16/09/2016", "arena": "Stamford Bridge", "attendance": 41514, "home_team": {"name": "Chelsea", "lineup": [{"name": "Thibaut Courtois", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Branislav Ivanovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gary Cahill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Luiz", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "César Azpilicueta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "N'Golo Kanté", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nemanja Matic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [84]}, {"name": "Willian", "yellows": [45], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [84]}, {"name": "Oscar", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [84]}, {"name": "Eden Hazard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Diego Costa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [61], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Asmir Begovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marcos Alonso", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cesc Fàbregas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [84], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pedro", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [84], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Moses", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [84], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michy Batshuayi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Temitayo Olufisayo Olaoluwa Aina", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Liverpool", "lineup": [{"name": "Simon Mignolet", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathaniel Clyne", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joel Matip", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dejan Lovren", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [17], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Milner", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Lallana", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordan Henderson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [36], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Georginio Wijnaldum", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Sadio Mané", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daniel Sturridge", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [57]}, {"name": "Philippe Coutinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [82]}], "subs": [{"name": "Loris Karius", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marko Grujic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alberto Moreno", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lucas Leiva", "yellows": [88], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [82], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Divock Origi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [57], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin Stewart", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Oviemuno Ejaria", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "A statement of intent was delivered here, but it was not offered up by Chelsea. Liverpool, for the second season in succession, have prevailed in this corner of south-west London to cast the locals into grisly retrospection and condemn the new regime to their first defeat. Jürgen Klopp’s wild celebrations on the final whistle reflected the psychological significance of this win. These teams are now level on points below Manchester City but, on this evidence, it is the side from Merseyside who have the more realistic aspirations to contend for the title.\n\nUnder-fire Jordan Henderson finds perfect timing with wonder goal Read more\n\nFor all that Diego Costa offered the hosts hope of recovery, Klopp’s charges were always the slicker, more coherent team. Their wave of first-half attacks had left Chelsea, a side braced for the onslaught, wounded and wheezing.\n\nThere was resilience when required late on to choke any hope of a proper comeback, efforts epitomised by James Milner’s gargantuan display from left-back, even if the management still seemed jittery in the technical area. Liverpool have now claimed seven points from trips to Arsenal, Tottenham Hotspur and Chelsea this season and thumped four past the champions, Leicester City. That renders the defeat at Burnley all the more perplexing but this is clearly a team on the rise.\n\nIt is their bite which all-comers will start to fear. Even without Roberto Firmino, who was resting a slight groin complaint, they were irrepressible for long periods up to the break and menacing on the counter-attack once Chelsea had over committed themselves in desperate pursuit of an equaliser. Klopp’s players have already developed that instinctive awareness of each other’s intentions in possession, team-mates darting into space on the gallop to be found with incisive passes. Opponents are beaten as much by speed of thought, though the accuracy and pace of the passing still takes the breath away. “We played football like hell,” said Klopp. Chelsea were simply scorched.\n\nPhilippe Coutinho, reintegrated here, is such a pinpoint provider, and Sadio Mané’s aggression and sheer speed across the turf leaves opponents diminished.\n\nChelsea, with their own rejigged rearguard incorporating the returning David Luiz for the first time, were left dizzied by the rapidity of the attacks. Even N’Golo Kanté could not cope at times and, given his impact for Leicester and Chelsea over 13 months in England, that says it all. “It’s not about ‘intensity’,” said Klopp. “It’s about finding a solution for the opponent. In the first half we had the ball, so it was about movement, playing simple football. The intensity comes when you make a mistake, as we did for their goal, and have to recover. We have to improve but we don’t run like crazy all the time.”\n\nFrenetic, after all, would have implied imprecision.They prospered while the home side dawdled. The struggling Branislav Ivanovic’s crude, albeit unsanctioned, challenge on Georginio Wijnaldum near the touchline earned a free-kick just after the quarter-hour with Coutinho exchanging passes with Milner. Their interplay seemed innocuous enough but it served to disorient a quartet of Chelsea players in the penalty area.\n\nWhile they ball-watched without an opponent close, only David Luiz and Gary Cahill seemed to sense the danger as three Liverpool players loitered at the far post. Coutinho’s delivery was whipped deliciously over the clutter and, while Daniel Sturridge retreated from an offside position, Dejan Lovren was onside to guide his finish back and across the exposed Thibaut Courtois.\n\nHe would be beaten again before the half was out, a throw-in opening up his defence even if Adam Lallana’s touch presented Cahill with the loose ball. Yet the centre-half scuffed his clearance to Jordan Henderson, 25 yards out, whose first touch was magnificent. His second was better, curling a searing shot which dipped beyond the despairing Courtois. This team have kept one clean sheet here in the Premier League all calendar year. “The goals we concede are strange,” bemoaned Antonio Conte after his first defeat as manager. “We must feel the danger and, today, we didn’t. We have to reflect a lot on this match because it is important to understand the situation if we don’t want to repeat another bad season like last year. We don’t feel the danger. Never.”\n\nThere was more urgency to their approach after the break as they desperately sought to coax Costa into the game.The Spain forward did well to adjust his body shape and poke a riposte through Milner on the goalline from Nemanja Matic’s cut-back after three Liverpool players overcommitted in the buildup but once Simon Mignolet had thwarted Costa again, the pursuit petered out.\n\nDivock Origi came closest to scoring the evening’s fourth, only for Courtois to summon a fine save, but too many Chelsea players lapsed into the bad habits of last season. Maybe John Terry’s organisational skills were missed but, while David Luiz was hardly at fault, too many others are error-prone or anonymous when it really mattered.\n\nWhere Conte had been spared at Watford by his substitutes, the trio of replacements were flung on too late here to make a proper impact with Michy Batshuayi not required at all. The Italian offered his hand to his opposite number at the end but was left waiting forlornly while Klopp celebrated with his players.\n\nChelsea’s unbeaten record has gone, shattered by the first

"Romelu Lukaku reminded everyone that form is temporary but class permanent by demolishing Sunderland’s fast-folding defence courtesy of a second-half hat-trick.\n\nQuite apart from pouring scorn on suggestions about Everton’s centre-forward possibly losing his domestic scoring touch, the excellence of Lukaku, Yannick Bolasie and Gerard Deulofeu left the Wearsiders with a solitary point from David Moyes’ first four games in charge. Their extraordinary collapse as Ronald Koeman’s team rose to third place does not bode well.\n\nThings may have been deceptively even during a sub-standard opening period but Koeman expected much more. “There was a big difference later,” he said. “I was really disappointed with the first half. Our concentration was poor. We lost so many second balls.” And Lukaku? “Romelu hadn’t scored and it was difficult for him. But he’s a fantastic striker, one of the best.”\n\nSunderland 0-3 Everton: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nMoyes punctuated his sentences with one word. “Disappointed, I’m very disappointed with our defending,” he said. “It was concerning. We couldn’t defend crosses. Our back four suddenly capitulated. It’s really annoyed me. Lukaku’s a top striker but we made it too easy for him.”\n\nCan it really be four months since the May evening when Sunderland beat Everton 3-0 here to seal Premier League survival? Who can forget a jubilant Sam Allardyce ‘dad dancing’ across the pitch in a manner that made Strictly’s Ed Balls look a seriously slick mover?\n\nMuch has changed since then. Allardyce and Roberto Martínez, the men in charge that night, have moved on to manage England and Belgium respectively, leaving Moyes and Koeman filling their old seats.\n\nIf it was something of a poignant occasion for Moyes, who spent 11 years managing at Goodison Park, it was also an anxious one as his Sunderland players sought that elusive victory.\n\nMoyes feels his old Everton might have won the League had they possessed a striker of Lukaku’s calibre so it was presumably with some trepidation that Moyes spotted him hovering unmarked as Bolasie crossed intelligently. Lukaku rose to meet that delivery only for Jordan Pickford to palm the ball away for a corner, thereby denying the Belgium striker his first goal of the campaign.\n\nEverton enjoyed the majority of possession but endured an anxious moment when Jermain Defoe stretched to connect with Adnan Januzaj’s deflected shot before firing narrowly over the bar left-footed. Like Lukaku before him he should have scored.\n\nAfter that things became a little scrappily haphazard for a time with Bolasie, ever menacing down the right, appearing a cut above everyone else. Even so, Lynden Gooch, a young Californian, had right-foot, left-wing, cross-shot that almost stole in under the bar before Maarten Stekelenburg somehow diverted the danger.\n\nAt half-time the temperature remained at a balmy 20C. If that was virtually unprecedented for a September Wearside evening, it was no surprise to see Koeman introduce Deulofeu. It proved a game-changing switch, the winger replacing a disappointing Ross Barkley whose imagination and incision looked to have deserted him. “Ross did not show the level I expected,” said Koeman. “I had to do something.”\n\nDeulofeu’s arrival enabled Bolasie to switch to the left and the pair immediately stretched Sunderland with the latter forcing Pickford into a diving save.\n\nLamine Koné – coveted by Koeman, at least before last night – outleapt Phil Jagielka at a corner before testing Stekelenburg’s reflexes but the tide was turning.\n\nThe home substitute Wahbi Khazri soon conceded possession to Deulofeu who initiated a counterattack. It concluded with the impressive Idrissa Gana seizing on a deflected pass and crossing to an un-minded Lukaku. This time he made no mistake, heading emphatically beyond Pickford.\n\nLukaku’s second arrived shortly after he hit the bar with a ferocious shot. No matter. When Bolasie – even better on the left – dodged Javier Manquillo and crossed impressively once more in the direction of the unmarked – yet again – centre-forward, Lukaku punished Pickford with another thumping header.\n\nBy way of variation his third was a wonderfully assured left-foot shot, assisted by some slapdash defending. Noting Papy Djilobodji, perhaps distracted by Deulofeu’s decoy manoeuvre, had gone awol from central defence Lukaku collected Kevin Mirallas’s pass before further destroying Pickford’s night.\n\nHe and Deulofeu could have added to the carnage but Moyes, by now slumped in his seat as Everton fans serenaded him with cheeky choruses of “sacked in the morning”, had surely suffered enough."},

Conte offered his compatriot and opposite number, Francesco Guidolin, a respectful pat on the arm at the final whistle but it was the scowl on the Chelsea manager’s face which betrayed his true feelings. His team have shed the first points of his tenure – wastefully, given their dominance for an hour in south Wales – to let a gap open up to Manchester City at the top. That could widen to a chasm in the months ahead if the worrying blend of profligacy and defensive fragility shown here is maintained.\n\nThis was one of those madcap occasions on which the Premier League so prides itself, a mismatch turned improbable yet ferocious end-to-end frenzy, but it was not a game Conte enjoyed. How could he when his team missed an opportunity to rattle up a cricket score before the break and then, unnerved by the belated injection of pace into Swansea City ranks, panicked to permit the hosts a route back into the match? His captain, John Terry, left the ground on crutches after pulling up in stoppage time with an ankle problem, rendering him a doubt for Friday’s awkward test against Liverpool, while the manager found the focus drawn back to the division’s pantomime villain of the moment, Diego Costa, yet again.\n\nChelsea’s Antonio Conte accuses defenders of targeting Diego Costa Read more\n\nThe Spain international’s goals preserved a point for Chelsea, his second coming courtesy of an overhead kick after Branislav Ivanovic’s attempt had looped up from Jordi Amat’s heel. The effort cannoned in off Federico Fernández to leave the locals spitting that Costa, of all people, should deny them an improbable win. They had railed up to then at his perceived eagerness to crumple dramatically to the turf, for all that Andre Marriner felt compelled to book a trio of home players for fouling the striker from behind.\n\nCosta, defended vehemently by his manager who bemoaned the treatment he was afforded by Amat and Fernández, was cautioned for his own lunge on Leroy Fer and tempted the referee to flash a second yellow after tumbling over Lukasz Fabianski’s challenge. His principal frustration by the end, however, was the memory of a miss from close range just before the interval. Had that been converted, Swansea would surely have struggled to muster any kind of comeback. The Brazil-born striker was caught on camera bellowing in anger while the coaches were exchanging their handshakes.\n\nIn truth it was all a bit too chaotic for either manager to end up feeling entirely at ease. Guidolin claimed his players will approach the week ahead “with enthusiasm and optimism” and insisted they will adapt to the new-fangled formation he had adopted, but the initial selection, devoid of pace and width where Ivanovic has proved so vulnerable against them in the past, felt like a mistake.\n\nThe way Chelsea waltzed through the home side’s awkward collection up to the interval proved as much – as would the apology Guidolin felt compelled to offer Neil Taylor after substituting the infuriated wing-back before the break – even if they capitalised only once on the indecision which had set in.\n\nSwansea’s Leroy Fer: I didn’t want the horse – I lived in an apartment Read more\n\nThat reward was prised relatively early on. Ivanovic’s cross was nodded up rather than out by Fernández. Fabianski might have claimed the looping ball but dithered, forcing the defender into a second uncertain header, before Oscar collected and squared to Costa. The finish was crisply dispatched into the corner of the net from the edge of the box as opposing players froze. It was a dismal concession, and one which should have proved the prelude to a thrashing. But with Costa’s subsequent miss, and Fabianski’s smart blocks from Eden Hazard and Willian, Swansea somehow survived.\n\nThen came the panic which, from nowhere, gripped Chelsea and so alarmed Conte. Modou Barrow’s introduction offered Swansea the pace they had previously lacked and it was his break on to Fer’s pass which cut the visitors open. With defenders attracted to the winger, Gylfi Sigurdsson was allowed to dart away from Terry through the middle screaming for a pass. The centre was actually overhit along the edge of the box but Thibaut Courtois, convinced he could intercept, sprang into a challenge and tripped the Icelander. He might have been relieved not to be dismissed but Sigurdsson thumped in the penalty regardless.\n\nChelsea were flustered, their concentration shattered, and there was a carelessness to Gary Cahill’s dawdle in possession two minutes later after collecting Terry’s pass. The centre-half was still clearly clattered by Fer, charging in from behind and twice making contact with his calves, only for Marriner, mystifyingly, to permit play to continue. The Dutchman squeezed his shot through the onrushing Courtois and his third goal this term dribbled into the net almost apologetically.\n\nSwansea City 2-2 Chelsea: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nEven acknowledging the foul, it was tempting to wonder if David Luiz, a player whose defensive nous is so often questioned and an unused substitute here following his £34m return from Paris Saint-Germain, might improve this team’s backline, a theory that may well be tested on Friday. Thrilling as all this was, Chelsea departed with regrets.

His team had held out and Claudio Bravo, his new goalkeeper, had been spared after a debut that could conceivably have wrecked all their outstanding work elsewhere on the pitch.\n\nBravo will not always be so fortunate if this eccentric performance is an accurate measure of what is to come but, on the balance of play, it was difficult not to feel the more sophisticated team had won. The first olés could be heard after 34 minutes from the corner of Old Trafford that was splashed in blue. A few moments later, Kelechi Iheanacho doubled City’s lead and at that stage it was difficult to remember a more one-sided derby since 2011 when Roberto Mancini’s team scored six here, Mario Balotelli unveiled his “Why Always Me?” T-shirt and Sir Alex Ferguson was driven away in a state of shock.\n\nJosé Mourinho: Claudio Bravo should have seen red for Rooney tackle Read more\n\nUnfortunately for City, it was not too long afterwards that Bravo’s first attempt to catch the ball led to Zlatan Ibrahimovic pulling one back and thereafter the away team’s superiority had to be balanced by the overwhelming suspicion that José Mourinho’s men had sussed out the opposition were relying on an accident-prone goalkeeper.\n\nMourinho was convinced United should have had a penalty in the second half, with Bravo implicated again, and Marcus Rashford’s introduction at half-time immediately provided a more threatening edge. The home side gave everything in the search for an equaliser and it will not soothe their disappointment that they contributed to a thrilling contest.\n\nTheir problem was they came up against a side that moved the ball with a rare combination of speed, fluidity and intelligence. David Silva, such a brilliantly measured footballer, chose a good day to put in one of his more refined performances. Nolito menaced on the left and Kevin De Bruyne, scorer of the first goal, added his own refined touches. If United occasionally looked slow in thought and movement, it was because their opponents passed the ball so stylishly.\n\nSergio Agüero was suspended but, attacking-wise, City were the more creative team and there were plenty of times in the second half when they could have added more goals. Leroy Sané, a substitute, slotted in seamlessly on his debut. De Bruyne struck the post in one breakaway move and Guardiola could also eulogise afterwards about the competitive courage of his team. Aleksandar Kolarov, he reported, finished the match with a front tooth missing. Nicolás Otamendi’s head was bandaged and Guardiola identified the combative Fernando, another substitute, as the outstanding player of the second half.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Pep Guardiola hugs his keeper Claudio Bravo after the final whistle. Photograph: Tom Jenkins for the Guardian\n\nMore than anything though, this was a glimpse into the free-flowing football that Guardiola wants from his teams, the irony being that when the opening goal arrived, after 15 minutes, it had its origins in a good old-fashioned whack upfield. Kolarov cleared the ball 60 yards, Iheanacho applied the flick and De Bruyne expertly did the rest, showing quicker anticipation than Daley Blind, steadying himself and firing a precise shot into the bottom left corner. The long ball, the flick-on and a goal – not exactly classic Guardiola but, for City, a thing of beauty, nonetheless.\n\nBlind had been badly exposed and it was the same player, later in the half, who played Iheanacho onside for the second goal after De Bruyne’s diagonal left-foot shot had come back off the post.\n\nUnfortunately for Bravo, United had reasonable suspicions before the match that he might be susceptible and they were proven correct. This was the keeper’s introduction to English football following his £17m move from Barcelona and perhaps, in hindsight, it was a mistake from Guardiola not to ease him in against West Ham a couple of weeks ago. Yet Guardiola was still entitled to expect his new goalkeeper to catch the free-kick that Wayne Rooney pumped into the penalty area in the 42nd minute.\n\nUntil that point, Bravo had looked assured, often straying 30 yards off his goal-line and confident enough to try a couple of passes that many goalkeepers would consider too risky. Now, however, he had some actual hand-work to do. He collided with John Stones, dropped the ball at Ibrahimovic’s feet and the Swede skimmed his volley inside the near post.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Claudio Bravo spills a simple ball before Zlatan Ibrahimovic lashed home. Photograph: Phil Noble/Reuters\n\nIbrahimovic had another two chances before half-time. The first was a header that went straight at Bravo and on the second occasion he had more time than he realised with the goalkeeper out of position. Bravo looked like a danger to his own team and was fortunate, undoubtedly, that the referee, Mark Clattenburg, decided to be lenient 11 minutes into the second half when the goalkeeper threw himself, studs-up, into a challenge on Rooney. Again, it stemmed from a mistake by the man who had been brought in to take Joe Hart’s place, miscontrolling the ball inside his own penalty area before desperately trying to make amends.\n\nManchester United 1-2 Manchester City: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nMourinho argued his team should have been awarded another penalty, for an alleged handball by Otamendi, but it was the Bravo challenge that irked him the most, believing it should have been a red card, too.\n\nUnited’s struggles in the first half could be summed up by Mourinho taking off Jesse Lingard and Henrikh Mkhitaryan at half-time, though he made it clear they were not the only ones guilty of “really poor individual performances”. Marouane Fellaini was moved further forwards with Rooney shifting to the right and Rashford patrolling the left.\n\nThe home team poured forwards, but they always looked vulnerable at the back and, for a club with United’s ambitions, it was startling to hear Mourinho complain that some of his players could not cope with the derby pressures."}, {"date": "10/09/2016", "arena": "Emirates Stadium",

Premier League. The sands were slipping away at the end of a match of frantic chances, it was heading towards a draw, well into stoppage time, when Southampton’s José Fonte grappled with Olivier Giroud in the penalty area. Frankly, the pair had been at each other ever since the Frenchman had come on to the pitch. Penalty.\n\nIt was obvious what was at stake for Arsenal. As Arsène Wenger admitted: “When you lose your first home game you cannot afford to drop points in the second home game as it creates anxiety. That is not what you want.”\n\nSanti Cazorla took the ball. Just to add to the nerve-shredding pressure of the moment, Laurent Koscielny had taken a kick to the face and required several minutes of treatment. The wait went on. Was there a winner in this game? Could Arsenal ensure they did not start the season by frittering away five points out of a possible six at home? Might Fraser Forster scupper them again?\n\nCazorla had sparkled all game, fighting for the right to dictate the game with imagination. He waited and waited. Then he waited for Forster to start his dive before planting his penalty down the middle for a valuable Arsenal victory.\n\nTottenham steamroller lacklustre Stoke with Son Heung-min double Read more\n\nIt was a tough blow for Southampton to absorb. They lamented the penalty decision, and the fact the referee had not stopped play in the buildup with Koscielny down injured close to the incident. “I’m angry for my players,” said Claude Puel. “I don’t like to speak about decisions but we can see in the first four games three penalties given. It is a big frustration because we played really well.”\n\nIndeed, they might have grabbed more from their efforts. Not only did they look like getting a draw, they squandered moments of their own to win it in the second half. Shane Long fluffed a couple of outstanding chances.\n\nIt was a challenging introduction for Arsenal’s new signings, Lucas Pérez and Shkodran Mustafi, who were thrust straight into the thick of it. There was adventurous football from both teams, but the search for ruthlessness led to a knife-edge atmosphere.\n\nAfter only a handful of training sessions getting to know their new team-mates, and with barely any football under their belts this season (Mustafi had only played one game and Pérez one half in La Liga before joining), both will clearly benefit from some time to adjust.\n\n“Both lack a bit of competition,” said Wenger. “They were a bit surprised by the pace and commitment of the Premier League. They will adapt to that.”\n\nIn the meantime it was up to the experienced men, notably Cazorla and Koscielny, to lead by example. That quality was dearly needed after Southampton opened the scoring in the 18th minute. They began with a scampering energy that unsettled Arsenal and a sharp move was interrupted when Nathan Redmond was clipped by Nacho Monreal.\n\nThe free-kick was positioned centrally in the D, and Dusan Tadic struck with expert dip. Petr Cech finger-tipped the ball on to the crossbar and it bounced down then ricocheted off the goalkeeper’s back and in for a bizarre own goal. Arsenal’s home discomfort hung in the air. Having lost their opening game here in a turbulent 4-3 defeat by Liverpool, there was a keen awareness that it was imperative to step it up in terms of both effort and cohesion. What to do? How about a spectacular bicycle kick from a centre-half?\n\nThat did the trick in style as Cazorla’s corner was bundled on by Francis Coquelin and Pérez, falling for Koscielny to audaciously finish in the manner of the kind of world-class centre-forward Arsenal have supposedly been short of for years. It was a birthday goal to remember for the captain.\n\nManchester City’s derby delight as De Bruyne inspires win over United Read more\n\nPuel introduced Long, who caused nightmares for Arsenal when they played last Christmas, at half-time to try to inject some fresh momentum. He certainly had the chances to do some damage again but his finishing was off-key.\n\nArsenal probed and dominated possession.

Eddie Howe had said so during the week. The home side, previously winless in the Premier League, were desperate for something to get their season up and running.\n\nIt might have come from Jack Wilshere, the high-profile loan signing from Arsenal, only for Howe to keep him largely in cold storage. Wilshere was used as a substitute from the 62nd minute and, apart from one smart flick that created an opportunity for Junior Stanislas, his debut was low-key. He came on in the No10 role, but was switched to right midfield after Howe made his other two changes.\n\nSanti Cazorla injury-time penalty gives Arsenal win against Southampton Read more\n\nCallum Wilson was the Bournemouth hero and what a feeling it was for him when he touched home the winner from Adam Smith’s cross as time ticked down. It was the striker’s first goal since he ruptured knee ligaments last September and Howe was not guilty of hyperbole when he said that it had meant everything to him.\n\n“You could see that in the celebrations,” Howe said. “You almost don’t feel like you are back and fit until you do score. It’s been a long road for Callum, but he’s shown remarkable mental strength. He was at the peak of his career when he suffered the injury.”\n\nFor Tony Pulis and West Bromwich Albion, the frustration lay in their failure to capitalise on the chances they created – Saido Berahino was the biggest culprit – and it was compounded by the away fans’ unflattering comments in stoppage time.\n\nPulis said that the protracted take-over of the club by a Chinese company, fronted by Guochuan Lai, would happen next week, but they have been in limbo and it has been damaging, particularly during the summer transfer window when, to Pulis’s irritation, there was such an underwhelming return.\n\nPulis made the point that his remit during his 19 months in charge had been to keep the club in the Premier League while making a financial profit, which he has done. His team have finished 13th and 14th. But, he wanted to shout, it is difficult to do much more with the constraints that he is under.\n\n“The only way you see yourself going forward is that you need to improve the squad,” he said. “You saw in this game that we needed to bring other players in. We’ve not been able to do that for all sorts of reasons.”\n\nHowe’s decision to start Wilshere on the bench was a major talking point, particularly in light of the fanfare that had accompanied the midfielder’s arrival. But Howe said that caution had to be the watchword given Wilshere’s fitness record and current condition, after playing so little in recent times.\n\n“With the data we have looked at, it was not a difficult decision,” Howe said. “We felt that half an hour was a good call for him. We don’t want to push him too early. The safest and best option was the decision we took.”\n\nWilshere said: “If there is a question mark about me, I know that it’s my fitness so I hope to get as many minutes in, prove everyone wrong and re-kick my career. The manager has a plan for me, so I was happy to be on the bench.”\n\nBournemouth were the better team in the first half as Albion stood off them in overly accommodating fashion, but they created little of clear-cut note, despite Jordon Ibe enjoying some nice moments. Wilson had the best chance after Ben Foster had beaten out Stanislas’s shot, but he could not capitalise after a ricochet.\n\nBerahino blew a clear chance before the interval and he would be denied by Artur Boruc at point-blank range on 53 minutes after the Bournemouth goalkeeper had been worked by Brendan Galloway.\n\nBoruc also saved well from Gareth McAuley and Matt Phillips hit the crossbar with a free-kick from the flank, which he appeared to have intended as a cross.\n\nIbe went close to scoring on 54 minutes and Stanislas was denied by Foster after Wilshere’s touch of quality, but – thanks to Wilson – Bournemouth got the job done.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jack Wilshere after coming off the bench.

does not have to spend another week as Hull’s caretaker manager after his side again showed their fighting spirit to snatch a draw at Burnley.\n\nRobert Snodgrass’s added-time free-kick at Turf Moor brought Hull a seventh point from a possible 12 – the kind of tally many had expected them to have collected by Christmas – after the Belgium international Steven Defour put Burnley ahead with a classy solo effort from 25 yards. The equaliser completed a good week for Snodgrass, after his hat-trick for Scotland against Malta.\n\nPhelan has faced significant adversity since taking over from Steve Bruce in the summer and has been a dignified centrepiece at an otherwise chaotic club, but a permanent contract remains a talking point rather than a done deal.\n\nBuoyed by his first taste of “Fergie time” as a manager – having served on the Manchester United touchline as an assistant to Sir Alex Ferguson when the term was coined – he laid out his mandate to the Hull owners.\n\n“I’ve made it pretty clear I want to be in charge of this group of players. I think the players have made it quite clear too,” Phelan said.\n\n“At one point I thought we were playing really well, we might win the game and then it’s over to negotiations again ... then at 1-0 down you think maybe not, maybe another week.\n\n“But I’m sure things will get resolved. They probably will do, one way or another. We haven’t fallen out or done anything drastic, we’re taking it day by day and hopefully another week doesn’t go by without it being resolved.”\n\nSean Dyche backed his opposite number’s claim after the late blow of Snodgrass’s equaliser denied his team a second Premier League win of the season. The Burnley manager said: “It’s for them to decide but Mike’s a good football man, he’s been around a long time and I’ve got a lot of respect for him.”\n\nDespite that Dyche was keen to suggest that the notion of Hull as a crisis club did not quite reflect the strength of their first XI, which here included nine capped internationals. “Don’t be bluffed by this ‘woe is Hull story’, they have a lot of experienced players and some of those players cost a lot of money,” Dyche claimed.\n\nPhelan gave the final word to Snodgrass, who scored in the opening day victory over Leicester and got a hat-trick for Scotland against Malta last weekend. He missed Hull’s last season in the Premier League with a career-threatening knee injury and is making up for lost time with aplomb.\n\n“He went through a real spell where it was serious ... would he continue in this game?” Phelan said. “He’s worked really hard, now he’s scored a hat-trick for the national team and a perfectly executed free-kick for his club in a week.”\n\nWatford in stunning

retaining Wilfried Zaha. That assessment was fully vindicated as the pair not only scored a goal apiece but, at times, thoroughly unnerved and overpowered Middlesbrough. Their impact left Crystal Palace celebrating a first Premier League win of the season and their much-criticised manager breathing a little easier.\n\nNot that things were entirely straightforward. “It was a strange one,” Pardew said. “We had spells when we were in control, but at the end, we were hanging on against a very competent Boro who showed great maturity and don’t look like a newly-promoted team.\n\n“It was a tough Premier League game and the win was very important for us. In this division, the spotlight comes on you quickly and if you don’t start winning it can affect your confidence.”\n\nNonetheless, Pardew had been sufficiently relaxed to watch the lunchtime Manchester derby in the Riverside’s press room. Having relocated to the technical area, he remained similarly unruffled as Benteke headed Palace in front following Zaha’s angled cross.\n\nThe £27m forward, recently arrived from Liverpool, easily outjumped the normally dominant Dani Ayala to direct a wonderful looping effort beyond Víctor Valdés’s reach. While Pardew restricted his celebrations to jotting some notes on a pad, a young visiting substitute seated behind him offered a study in unrestrained delight.\n\nGrinning from ear to ear, Jonathan Benteke, Christian’s younger brother, and fellow striker, applauded enthusiastically as his sibling not only scored a first goal for the club, but justified Palace’s strategy of playing to their lone forward’s strengths.\n\nZaha’s crossing proved key to this gameplan and when the winger’s pace swept him beyond George Friend another fine centre resulted in Benteke cueing Andros Townsend up for a very presentable shooting chance. This time, though, Valdés was equal to the challenge and saved smartly.\n\nBar an early Álvaro Negredo volley, directed off target following decent work from Stewart Downing and Adam Forshaw – impressing in central midfield after keeping Marten de Roon on the bench – Boro were initially on the back foot. Then, with half-time approaching, they finally rediscovered a measure of the ruthless efficiency that underpinned last season’s promotion campaign. Ayala dodged Damien Delaney before connecting with Downing’s corner and powering a header towards the top corner. Possibly slightly slow to react, Steve Mandanda could only help the ball on its journey.\n\nRelief flooded the Riverside, but it swiftly became qualified as Boro spurned an unexpected second chance. Viktor Fischer generally disappointed, but his superb threaded pass left Negredo clean through only for Mandanda to successfully second guess the striker’s shooting intentions.\n\nReprieved, Palace restored their lead in the 47th minute. Initially, it looked as if James McArthur’s pass would be too short for Zaha, but aided by a horrible mistake from the normally dependable Friend the winger seized possession.\n\nThe left-back must have felt like watching through his fingers as Zaha, who had outmuscled him before hijacking the ball, proceeded to shoot beyond Valdés’s grasp. “It was very important Wilf stayed,’ said Pardew, with real feeling.\n\nBournemouth claim first win of season as Callum Wilson sinks West Brom Read more\n\nOnce again, Boro rallied. Downing zipped a shot marginally wide before Ben Gibson tested Mandanda from distance, the keeper doing well to divert the danger. It was time for Aitor Karanka to introduce Gastón Ramírez and De Roon. The newcomers immediately fazed Palace, with the former especially influential. “Ramírez made a real difference when he came on,” said Pardew. “I was pleased he didn’t start.”\n\nBoro’s first league defeat beckoned, but they were not about to surrender lightly. Accordingly, the closing stages had three home penalty appeals of varying potential legitimacy against Scott Dann (handball), Delaney (handball) and Zaha (felling Friend) dismissed, while Martin Kelly’s last-gasp clearance denied Negredo a close-range equaliser after Mandanda parried Ramírez’s shot.\n\nVictory relieved all sorts of pressure on Pardew – for the moment at least – but left Karanka brutally realistic. “We lost from our mistakes,” he said. “We didn’t play with enough intensity in the first half.

Son Heung-min scored twice before Dele Alli and Harry Kane struck their first goals of the campaign and, in doing so, confirmed that Tottenham are up and running for the new season after playing fitfully in their first three matches.\n\nHughes, meanwhile, may have disciplinary matters to fret about in addition to his team’s botched start to the season after being sent to the stands in the first half. Stoke are bottom of the league with one point from four matches.\n\nTottenham took the lead thanks to their ability to keep calm in the storm caused in part by Stoke’s fury with the referee, Anthony Taylor, and the fourth official, Jon Moss. Taylor, acting on advice from Moss, ordered Hughes to vacate the sideline in the 34th minute after the manager stomped out of his technical area to vent his anger at the booking of Marko Arnautovic for simulation.\n\nHughes felt that Stoke should have been given a free-kick before that for a foul on Jonathan Walters and was doubly aggrieved when Taylor judged Arnautovic’s “evasive action” to be a dive.\n\n“Those were two decisions I felt should have gone our way so I reacted in a forceful manner,” Hughes said. “Sometimes you forget that this year you’re not allowed to come out of your technical area. Mr Moss, bless him, felt that warranted a sending off, which, by the letter of the law, it did, so I have to hold my hands up. But I saw Sky say that maybe I swore, which I didn’t.”\n\nAs he left the pitch Hughes made gestures to rev up the home crowd. Then he tried to send a different message to away supporters. “I was telling them to shut up,” he said. “Sorry if I did that.”\n\nThat hoopla created a sizzling atmosphere in which players needed to stay cool. Spurs did so better and were rewarded by Son’s goal in the 41st minute.\n\nWatford in stunning comeback as they hit four to shock West Ham Read more\n\nJoe Allen might have thwarted it if he had not overcommitted when trying to dispossess Christian Eriksen, allowing the Dane to sidestep him before pulling the ball back from the sideline to Son, who was unmarked 12 yards from goal. The South Korean guided it first time into the net with his left foot. Such composure in the bedlam can only have encouraged Mauricio Pochettino, bearing in mind how his team lost their heads and the league title at Stamford Bridge last season.\n\nEarlier, Spurs had to show resilience to weather a storm of another kind, as Stoke started strongly. Wilfried Bony, making his debut for the hosts after joining on loan from Manchester City, gave the team a much-needed fulcrum up front. The Ivorian threatened as early as the second minute when he exchanged passes with Walters before unleashing a 16-yard shot that was blocked by Jan Vertonghen.\n\nGlenn Whelan and Ryan Shawcross also had efforts foiled by defenders. Tottenham gradually took the upperhand, however, thanks to the crispness and swiftness of their passing. Son served notice of his menace by collecting a crossfield pass from Toby Alderweireld on the half-hour and dashing towards the Stoke area. Arnautovic chased back to disrupt his progress but inadvertently played the ball into the path of Alli. He dragged a shot past the advancing Shay Given but wide of the post. Then, following Hughes’s expulsion, Son shot Spurs in front.\n\nHalf-time brought a chance to regroup and Stoke did hint at a comeback early in the second half. But Son quashed it with a superb strike on the counterattack, collecting another pass from Eriksen at the corner of the area and sweeping a first-time shot in at the far post. Stoke began to unravel. “The second goal deflated us more markedly than it should have,” Hughes said.\n\nSpurs were not minded to show mercy. The visitors inflicted further damage through another rapid counterattack on the hour. Kyle Walker hurtled down the right and picked out Alli, who, like Son for the first goal, had found space in the middle of the area and took full advantage.\n\nWith Victor Wanyama on a yellow card and guilty of a couple of tackles that the home crowd believed should have resulted in a red, Pochettino made a substitution to ensure Tottenham kept 11 players on the pitch, replacing Wanyama with Érik Lamela. “It was better to take the pressure off the referee and Victor,” said Pochettino.\n\nAll that was missing from Spurs’ point of view was a goal for Harry Kane. So Son helped deliver one. He tricked his way down the left before providing a pass that enabled Kane to end the wait for his first goal of the campaign.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mark Hughes reacts angrily after being sent to the stands by Anthony Taylor.

of fighting in the stands of the Olympic Stadium.\n\nWest Ham confirmed that supporters had been ejected from the ground after a dispute broke out not just between rival supporters but groups of home fans, unhappy at the seating arrangements in the club’s new stadium. Many other supporters had left by the final whistle, however, after a capitulation that Slaven Bilic found hard to explain.\n\nTwo headed goals from Michail Antonio in the first half an hour had apparently set West Ham fair for victory, before Odion Ighalo and Troy Deeney levelled before half-time. The Hornets stung the hosts twice more after the break, but Bilic suggested the crucial blow was struck before then. “From my point of view the first goal was way too easy,” the West Ham manager said. “It came from a very predictable attack and we should at least have put them in a situation where they had to do something better to hurt us.\n\n“For the first 40 minutes we controlled the game and if anyone was going to score more it was us. You can’t concede that type of goal then.”\n\nMazzarri concurred that the home side dominated the early stages. “West Ham played very well in the beginning and especially in defence we were very afraid, but even then we had chances to score”, the Italian said.\n\n“We played very well in the second half, as we did against Arsenal, and it was because of us that we won, not a problem with West Ham. If we continue like this, it will be a great season.”\n\nIghalo had already fired a shot just past the post before West Ham opened the scoring in the sixth minute. The debutant striker Simone Zaza forced a corner and the returning West Ham hero Dimitri Payet stepped over to take it.\n\nHis inswinging ball eluded Winston Reid at the front post but found Antonio, whose stooping header came off his marker Deeney and past the bewildered Heurelho Gomes.\n\nSanti Cazorla injury-time penalty gives Arsenal win against Southampton Read more\n\nWatford were all over the place at the back but powerful going forward and Ighalo had two more chances before 15 minutes of the game were up. A quick counterattack in the eighth minute had the nimble Uruguayan Roberto Pereyra bearing down on the West Ham goal. He squared the ball for Ighalo, who took a touch and got a shot off but Arthur Masuaku managed to get a deflection on to the ball. Four minutes later Ighalo was on the spot again to connect with Daryl Janmaat’s cross but Adrián saved the volley with his legs.\n\nThe game was wide open but West Ham looked like they had sealed the result when they doubled their lead just after the half hour. It all came from a moment of joyous skill from the home side’s talisman, Payet. Antonio and Payet had swapped sides, leaving the Frenchman free to torment Miguel Britos. He sent him one way in the box, then cut back on the other, but Payet was not done, opting not to cross with his left foot but instead to execute a rabona with his right. The technique was perfect and Antonio dived in at the far post to connect with a storming header.\n\nA previously quiet stadium erupted and the home side looked like they would cruise into half-time. But then, with 41 minutes on the clock, came the moment that frustrated Bilic. A quick break found the young right-back Sam Byram out of position and Ighalo one on one with James Collins. The Nigerian threw Collins a shoulder and squeezed his shot under Adrián.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Watford’s Odion Ighalo celebrates scoring their first goal. Photograph: Eddie Keogh/Reuters\n\nBy the time the whistle blew for the interval, and to the almost audible surprise of the entire ground, Watford had equalised. After the match Mazzarri called Deeney the embodiment of the mentality he wants to see at the club, but it was a moment of pure quality from the skipper that levelled the match.\n\nOnly seconds before, he had bailed out the left-back José Holebas after another marauding Antonio run. But with fewer than 60 seconds of added time on the clock Deeney chased down a long ball and forced Adrián into punching it out of his area. He then got to the second ball himself and, with the Hammers defence bearing down on him, took one look and chipped the ball over the lot and inside the far stanchion. It was wonderful.\n\nTottenham steamroller lacklustre Stoke with Son Heung-min double Read more\n\nTwo each at half-time and the match was in the balance. But Watford had grown in confidence and came out determined to swing the match their way.\n\nBilic, meanwhile, spoke of “pale faces” in his dressing room. After seven minutes of the restart Watford claimed the lead for the first time when their leading scorer Etienne Capoue volleyed Pereyra’s cross through Adrián.\n\nThe Spaniard’s afternoon got even worse when Holebas won the ball on the edge of the box, got it back from Ighalo and shot low under his body.\n\nThis time, the game was truly over. West Ham were unable to get behind Watford again. The visitors had another goal ruled out for the substitute striker Stefano Okaka who then had to hobble off injured in injury time.

After all the hype surrounding the opening of a £114m stand it fell to Liverpool’s players to demonstrate that they, not concrete, steel or glass, dictate the mood inside an expectant arena. “Fill it with life,” Jürgen Klopp had instructed and his team obliged on cue, filling Anfield with goals, incisiveness and optimism as Leicester City were condemned to a comprehensive pounding.\n\nFor the Premier League champions it is an inauspicious start to their title defence and to a week when they make their debut on the Champions League stage against Club Brugge. Claudio Ranieri’s side lost only three league games last season and have now lost two of the opening quartet. They opened brightly, had their moments, but were made to look pedestrian at times by the quick thinking of Daniel Sturridge, Roberto Firmino and Adam Lallana and the quick feet of Sadio Mané. The quality of Liverpool’s goals – two assured finishes by Firmino, a superb team goal for Mané and an emphatic strike by Lallana – reflected their superiority in the final third over a team they trailed by 21 points last season. There will be no repeat on the evidence of Liverpool’s homecoming.\n\n“What we did today is what I expect from us,” said Klopp. “I am really on the side of the players. They are responsible for our good performances and I am responsible for our bad performances. That is an easy deal. We have to see how often we can show it. This league is so unbelievably strong, so competitive and today we were good. We need to perform and have atmospheres like this not only against the champions or when we score four goals. We have to create our own atmosphere for ourselves and nobody else.”\n\nLiverpool 4-1 Leicester City: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nFirmino delivered the opening ceremony that truly mattered with the first goal at the revamped stadium but the contribution of Sturridge, arguably only starting due to Philippe Coutinho’s international exertions for Brazil, was not lost on Anfield’s largest attendance since 1977. The England international tracked back diligently to halt a Leicester attack and intercepted for Simon Mignolet. Lucas Leiva, deputising for Dejan Lovren, who picked up a monstrous shiner after a clash of heads in training on Friday, found James Milner on the left and that was the signal for Firmino to lose Daniel Amartey with a piercing run. Milner delivered the required pass, the Brazilian cut inside Robert Huth and beat Kasper Schmeichel with an intelligent finish. The mood and flow of the game were transformed. “We started well but after the first goal we lost our counter and they played so, so well,” agreed Ranieri.\n\nMané was a devastating menace throughout and teed up Sturridge for a close-range shot that Schmeichel saved well. The Dane was powerless, however, when Sturridge returned the favour and Mané doubled Liverpool’s lead in thrilling fashion. Lucas, Firmino and Jordan Henderson were all involved as the Liverpool captain sent Sturridge clear with a measured chip over the top. The striker’s control was excellent, his second touch even better as he back-heeled inside for the unmarked Mané to scoop the ball over the Leicester goalkeeper’s despairing grasp and over the line.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sadio Mané lifts the ball over Kasper Schmeichel to put Liverpool 2-0 up. Photograph: Michael Regan/Getty Images\n\nAnfield purred over the comfortable lead but was left aghast by not one but two errors from Lucas. The makeshift centre-half mis-controlled a routine goal-kick from Mignolet and, with Shinji Okazaki closing in, compounded the error by clearing straight to Jamie Vardy. The striker accepted the gift from close range and Leicester almost equalised when Mignolet missed a long throw from Luis Hernández, a replacement for the hamstrung Danny Simpson, and Huth’s looping header landed on the top of the bar.\n\nRanieri tried to sharpen his attack with the introduction of Ahmed Musa, the £17m summer signing from CSKA Moscow, but Liverpool’s tireless and tricky front three monopolised the danger. Lallana, fresh from saving England in Slovakia, drove an unstoppable finish into the top corner following a neat lay-off from the impressive Georginio Wijnaldum. The fourth arrived in the final moments when Henderson, earlier guilty of a glaring miss, released Mané behind a square Leicester defence and a needless rush by Schmeichel. Mané unselfishly squared for Firmino to seal victory with a nonchalant finish.\n\nThere was a bizarre moment at 3-1 when, with the Kop singing his name, Klopp reacted furiously to the tribute and pointed to his watch to say the serenading was premature. His grievance may have been supported by Vardy breaking clear and forcing an important save from Mignolet but the manager’s concern was out of context with Liverpool’s dominance. “Please don’t sing my name before the game is decided,” he requested. “It is nice but not necessary.” It is also hard for supporters to resist with victories like this."}, {"date": "28/08/2016", "arena": "The Hawthorns",

desperate need for new signings at West Bromwich Albion was laid bare. Tony Pulis looked as exasperated as the West Brom supporters, who endured 90 minutes of tedious action in a game where both teams were lucky to get nil.\n\nWest Brom set to sign Nacer Chadli from Tottenham in £13m deal Read more\n\nAlbion, who have completed only one permanent transfer this summer, were woeful as an attacking force. There was no creativity or spark and they looked devoid of ideas as to how to break down Middlesbrough. Saido Berahino started on the bench and the reaction to his introduction in the second half – a chorus of boos – suggested that the home fans would have been happy for him to remain there.\n\nBerahino could not get off the pitch quickly enough at the end and, judging from Pulis’s comments after the match, the striker may well have played his last game for the club. The Albion manager said Berahino’s situation would be a “topic of conversation” over the next 48 hours, with Stoke City understood to be ready to return to the negotiating table to try to agree a £20m deal.\n\nWhether Berahino is still a West Brom player come 11pm on Wednesday is neither here nor there in many respects. The bottom line is that Albion need a number of new faces before the deadline irrespective of Berahino’s future – it is worth noting that the 23-year-old has scored only once in his last 27 Premier League appearances – and it threatens to be a long winter of discontent at The Hawthorns if the board fail to bring in those signings.\n\nThe situation feels critical and has been complicated by the fact that Albion’s hopes of taking Jay Rodriguez on loan have fallen through after he came off the bench to score for Southampton on Saturday. The Tottenham Hotspur winger Nacer Chadli looks set to move for a club record fee, with Pulis still hopeful that as many as five players will join within the next three days.\n\nThe Welshman was asked whether the supporters’ discontent at the final whistle will convince the board to listen and make some progress in the transfer market. “I don’t think there is a problem with the boardroom,” Pulis said. “They don’t need people to boo to know my feelings.\n\n“What we’ve got to do – and we keep saying it – is bring some players in.\n\n“Two years ago when I came into the club, they were struggling at the foot of the table and 14 or 15 of those players are still here. They’ve done fantastic. They’ve kept going and finished 12th [13th] and 14th – but we need new blood now. We need to get some players in and hopefully over the next few days that will happen.\n\n“I think the players, as much as anybody else, need to see a few coming in.\n\n“And not just any players; players with quality. We’re the top team in the West Midlands and that’s what we want to be and stay, and to do that we need to get some players. I think we need it all the way through the pitch.\n\n“The team’s an old team, as I’ve said last year and the year before. We need some legs but we also need quality. I’m not having a go. I think if you spoke to any of the players, they’re all the same – they’re all waiting for people to come in. Hopefully it’s going to be a real busy couple of days.”\n\nWest Brom’s direct route is easily cut off as Tony Pulis struggles for answers Read more\n\nA couple of bright notes for Albion were the performances of the 18-year-old Sam Field, who looked composed in possession on his full Premier League debut and left the field to deserved applause when he was withdrawn in the second half, and Brendan Galloway’s impressive display at left-back.\n\nOtherwise it was a day to forget.\n\nAs for Middlesbrough, this will be viewed as a useful point, although it could have been an even more rewarding afternoon for Aitor Karanka’s side if they had played with a bit more conviction. They had no shortage of possession but the neat passing at the base of their midfield, where Adam Clayton and Adam Forshaw were seeing plenty of the ball, rarely led to anything meaningful. Cristhian Stuani, with the angle against him, shot tamely into the arms of Ben Foster in the 74th minute and that was probably Middlesbrough’s best moment.\n\nNot that Karanka was disappointed. Middlesbrough are unbeaten in their opening three matches on returning to the Premier League and, with five points on the board already, are entitled to be satisfied with the way the season has started. Karanka praised his players for the spirit they showed against West Brom and in particular their response to the opening 15 minutes, when Albion started brightly and James McClean looked lively.\n\nPulis felt that Albion had a reasonable shout for a penalty at the end of the first half, when Ben Gibson clearly tugged at Salomón Rondón’s shirt as the striker tried to get on the end of Galloway’s cross. Yet the referee, Anthony Taylor, was not interested and with that the best chance of a goal being scored disappeared."}, {"date": "28/08/2016", "arena": "Etihad Stadium", "attendance": 54008,

reign, with the players slowly getting used to a new set of ideas, different tactics and a manager who gives the impression he is satisfied only by the highest forms of excellence. Five games, five wins – Guardiola has had an immaculate start, even if the latest is tarnished by the potential loss of Sergio Agüero to suspension.\n\nAgüero will certainly be fortunate, to say the least, if the Football Association’s disciplinary department chooses not to punish the second-half elbow on Winston Reid. A charge of violent conduct is far more likely and that has obvious consequences when City’s first game after the international break is Manchester United at Old Trafford. Agüero, who also stands to miss the home game against Bournemouth the following week and the EFL Cup tie against Swansea City, had not had one of his better games and perhaps there was an element of frustration in the incident that meant a shaken Reid was unable to continue.\n\nPep Guardiola’s tactical nous upstaged by Manchester City’s sheer will to win Read more\n\nOtherwise, it was another satisfying day for City featuring another demonstration of Raheem Sterling’s renascent form since Guardiola’s arrival. Sterling scored twice and the England international looks rejuvenated at a time when it is difficult to think of another club in the Premier League era with a greater choice of creative players.\n\nThis victory concluded with Guardiola declaring Samir Nasri, an unexpected substitute, can stay in Manchester when last week it seemed certain that the Frenchman would leave. When and where he plays would be another matter. Nolito has slotted seamlessly into the left side of attack. David Silva, that gem of a footballer, is playing with distinction while Kevin De Bruyne always offers hope because of his rare ability to put the ball exactly where he wants it, epitomised by the free‑kick for Fernandinho’s goal.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Fernandinho heads home Kevin De Bruyne’s free-kick to make it 2-0 to Manchester City. Photograph: Matthew Ashton/AMA/Getty Images\n\nMore than anything, there is the sense of a team who can still get better and that must be thrilling for City’s supporters when the improvement is already considerable. Leroy Sané, lest it be forgotten, has not had the chance to play a single minute yet. The same applies to Ilkay Gündoğan, Guardiola’s first signing, while Claudio Bravo was in the stands after his £17m move from Barcelona.\n\nGuardiola’s decision not to start his new goalkeeper was a perplexing one – better here, you might imagine, than a debut in the Manchester derby – and threatened to backfire when Willy Caballero came for a cross in the 59th minute, flapped at thin air and Michail Antonio headed in the goal that made it 2-1 and changed the complexion of this match.\n\nThe game had been so one-sided until that point it came as a jolt to discover that City were threatening to waste all their previous good work. They had been exhilarating in the first half but Caballero’s mistake contributed to a jittery half an hour before Sterling soothed the crowd’s nerves with the final goal.\n\nFor West Ham United, still missing the injured Dimitri Payet, there were times in the first half when they were completely outplayed. Guardiola’s players did not just move the ball at uncommon speed, they chased down their opponents with an urgency that was rarely seen under Manuel Pellegrini. If the players lost possession they did everything to get it back as quickly as possible. It is the mentality that helped make Barcelona such a formidable team under Guardiola’s guidance and, if anything, it was a surprise their superiority did not bring them even more goals.\n\nSterling’s first goal came in the seventh minute when Silva moved across the centre of the pitch, from right to left and slid his pass behind the visiting defence for Nolito to reach the byline. Sterling was unmarked in the penalty area and turned Nolito’s cutback beyond Adrián, West Ham’s goalkeeper, with a fine first‑time finish.\n\nManchester City 3-1 West Ham United: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nAfter 18 minutes the victory had started to feel like a foregone conclusion. Fernandinho had headed in De Bruyne’s brilliant delivery and West Ham, with the 20-year-old Ashley Fletcher making his full debut, looked desperately inferior. Yet Antonio has now scored eight headers in the Premier League in the past year, more than any other player, and the latest one gave Slaven Bilic’s team new momentum. City were aggrieved that the cross came from Arthur Masuaku when, already booked, the player had brought down his studs on John Stones’s knee in a first-half challenge that went unpunished.\n\nWest Ham were reinvigorated, with Cheikhou Kouyaté increasingly influential and Guardiola looking agitated on the touchline. Ultimately, though, Bilic’s team could not capitalise on that period when the home side suddenly looked a little unsure of themselves.\n\nThose were the moments that will encourage José Mourinho before the derby but, even then, City’s penetrative qualities threatened more goals. Nasri had a couple of chances to mark his return – the player was no longer overweight, Guardiola reported – with a goal.\n\nWest Ham had to take extra risks in the final exchanges and Silva also hit the post in that period before playing in Sterling to go around Adrián, steady himself and ensure another win by rolling in a carefully placed shot from a difficult angle."}, {"date": "27/08/2016",

back in his chair, threw a glance to the skies, and wore the expression of a man who had just been told the last bus home had been cancelled. “Oh my God,” he said, exhaling deeply. The information he was trying to take in actually concerned one of the decisive moments of Liverpool’s 1-1 draw with Tottenham. It was a moment that might have turned one point into an excellent three.\n\nWith one of their crisp breaks Georginio Wijnaldum slipped the ball to Adam Lallana, who pushed the move onwards and the ball across goal for Sadio Mané to tap in. Up went the official’s flag and the strike was disallowed for a very tight offside. “What can I say?” Klopp said. “It was a wonderful goal, huh? Brilliant play. It happens.”\n\nArsenal’s Mesut Özil and Alexis Sánchez turn on style against Watford Read more\n\nHe sounded phlegmatic but looked slightly crestfallen. Despite the positives he can take from a complicated early season cluster of games all away from home, he made no bones about his disappointment that there were no more points on the board to show for it. “We have not the most easy starting programme. Four points from nine is not what I wanted but it’s OK. That’s our platform.”\n\nTottenham’s platform shows five points from nine but in terms of the team’s energy levels and attacking zest there has to be more to come from Mauricio Pochettino’s team. For much of this tussle they toiled, they endeavoured, but clear chances did not come easily. The attacking prowess of Harry Kane, Dele Alli and the newcomer Vincent Janssen is yet to really catch fire this season. Pochettino didn’t seem to mind too much if it’s been a slow burner up until this point. “Last season Harry scored in game 10 and was top scorer. I would sign up again for that,” he smiled.\n\nLiverpool had more than enough chances to win, quite apart from the mysterious offside call. From the start the thrust of Mané and trickery of Philippe Coutinho tested Tottenham. They set about the challenge here with swift movement and energy.\n\nWith half-time approaching, Liverpool were handed a clear opportunity to turn their attacking promise into something concrete with a penalty. The referee Bobby Madley saw Érik Lamela catch Roberto Firmino at the edge of the box and pointed to the spot. It was down to James Milner, who had been filling in unfussily at left-back, to make the difference. He slammed his shot past Michel Vorm.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest James Milner sends Michel Vorm the wrong way to open the scoring from the penalty spot. Photograph: Dylan Martinez/Reuters\n\nTottenham needed a response, a shot of energy, of inspiration after the break. But it was Liverpool who restarted with more intent: Wijnaldum scooped over; the impressive Joël Matip skimmed a header off the top of the crossbar.\n\nChelsea have menacing look as Victor Moses completes defeat of Burnley Read more\n\nPochettino’s frustration was growing but he later credited his team’s resolve for summoning enough pressure to equalise. Danny Rose escaped the general congestion and was allowed plenty of space to pick his spot when Eric Dier’s cross was knocked towards him. Rose beat Simon Mignolet at the near post, releasing a wave of pent-up Tottenham angst. “ I am very pleased with the reaction, the effort and character we showed because it wasn’t easy,” assessed Pochettino, who had to rebalance his team when Kyle Walker felt sick. Dier switched effortlessly to right-back, and the attack was rearranged.\n\nThey could have even won it with Toby Alderweireld’s powerful header, which inspired the agile, twisting, save of the day from Mignolet.\n\nThe fact it was only one vital stop meant something to Klopp in measuring his team’s progress, as the keeper had been incredibly busy in the same fixture last year. “Simon saved our life last time. Today he had one brilliant save,” Klopp said. Liverpool had late chances to clinch it themselves but it was not to be and the manager preached the possibilities he can see in his team, even if there is more polish to come. “This game showed again what we can do. We were really flexible and offensive and played football, had wonderful moments with passing and direction. I wish we would have won it but we have to accept the point and it’s OK. That’s what we have to show in each game.”\n\nPochettino bade farewell to a large chunk of his players on international duty thankful to have avoided a nasty slip. He feels he is “months” away from having his squad where he wants it to be in order to truly compete. He is not the only manager who has lamented the difficulty in finding a sharp groove after a truncated, post-European Championship pre-season.\n\nTottenham 1-1 Liverpool: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\n“This is not a perfect break,” Pochettino says. “All the players involved [in the Euros] go again to the national team. It is difficult because some players are going, some will play, others no. We need maybe a few months to get all in the same level. It’s crazy.”\n\nNo doubt there is more to come from both Tottenham and Liverpool."}, {"date": "27/08/2016", "arena": "Stamford Bridge", "attendance": 41607, "home_team": {"name": "Chelsea", "lineup": [{"name": "Thibaut Courtois", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Branislav Ivanovic", "yellows": [44], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gary Cahill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Terry", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "César Azpilicueta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "N'Golo Kanté", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willian", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [41], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [77]}, {"name": "Oscar", "yellows": [31], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nemanja Matic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eden Hazard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [9], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [81]}, {"name": "Diego Costa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [80]}], "subs": [{"name": "Asmir Begovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cesc Fàbregas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pedro", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [81], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ruben Loftus-Cheek", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Moses", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [89], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [77], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michy Batshuayi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [80], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Temitayo Olufisayo Olaoluwa Aina", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Burnley", "lineup": [{"name": "Tom Heaton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matthew Lowton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Keane", "yellows": [50], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Mee", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stephen Ward", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "George Boyd", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dean Marney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [72]}, {"name": "Steven Defour", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [57]}, {"name": "Scott Arfield", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [57]}, {"name": "Andre Gray", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sam Vokes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Michael Kightly", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paul Robinson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lukas Jutkiewicz", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Johann Berg Gudmundsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [57], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Tarkowski", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [72], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tendayi Darikwa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aiden O'Neill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [57], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "The fanfare has been reserved up to now for the contenders up in Manchester, the focus fixed rather more on the resumption of a duel between Pep Guardiola and José Mourinho now to be played out over a city divide. Yet, slipping beneath the radar down in the capital, Chelsea are a team revived under Antonio Conte. The threat they pose in the title race this term should not be underestimated.\n\nThis was a third successive league win under the Italian, and the most impressive of the team’s displays under his stewardship to date, with Burnley dismantled from the outset and outclassed throughout.\n\nChelsea were irrepressible, Eden Hazard epitomising it all by tearing at will beyond the unfortunate Matthew Lowton as if last season had just been a bad dream. Willian provided balance by exploiting Stephen Ward on the opposite flank, but there was urgency all over this team. Burnley, far too passive for comfort, never stood a chance.\n\nLeicester survive late scare against Swansea to secure first win of season Read more\n\nConte, wearing a black armband in memory of those who lost their lives in the earthquake which struck central Italy on Wednesday, never stopped bellowing instructions at any point, even when the game was clearly won. He kicked every ball, berated every mistake or pang of sloppiness, and celebrated manically each of his team’s goals as if this was the game upon which the championship hinged. Successful tackles drew a similar response.\n\nIt is easy to see why he is in need of a few days off next week, but he will relax easier knowing his team are retiring into the international break with their pristine record maintained. “It’s actually a pity that there’s now a break because I wanted to continue playing games,” said the Italian. “We played good football with good ball possession, created a lot of chances to score goals. The most important thing was, after 13 games conceding goals at home [stretching back to the visit of Scunthorpe United in mid-January] we didn’t concede.”\n\nThat is a remarkable statistic, but this was less a contest than a rout. Hazard’s opening goal, so slickly taken, was a wrecking ball to the visitors’ gameplan. Where Sean Dyche’s side had sat back and defended so stoutly against Liverpool the previous week, their own lead having been established in the opening exchanges, here Burnley were gasping in arrears from the moment, 10 minutes in, the Belgian collected possession just inside his own half. As he sprinted forward at panicked defenders, Diego Costa and Willian dragged opponents out of position with clever, selfless runs. Ben Mee was too flustered to risk a challenge, with Hazard easily cutting inside and curling a delicious shot into the far corner of Tom Heaton’s net.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Eden Hazard curls in a fantastic opening goal after just 10 minutes. Photograph: Frank Augstein/AP\n\nIt was a goal reminiscent of the forward at his best in the title-winning 2014-15 campaign, reward taken on the gallop with the confidence of a player utterly content with his role in the team. Last season feels like an aberration when he performs with this effervescence, and he clearly benefits from the industry of those around him.\n\nN’Golo Kanté’s busy energy as Chelsea’s new midfield shield has given the creators a platform upon which to perform – the France international has slipped seamlessly into this setup – though Oscar was just as feverish with his tackling further up the pitch. Even Nemanja Matic, a player diminished over the last 18 months, looked more like his old self.\n\nCrystal Palace’s Scott Dann denies Bournemouth in injury time Read more\n\nHeaton alone preserved the visitors’ relative respectability. After Mee scrambled another Hazard shot from the goalline, the goalkeeper saved smartly from John Terry’s header and instinctively from Costa’s rather languid shot, an opportunity that came about thanks to Oscar’s quick feet near the byline which had left Steven Defour grounded and helpless.\n\n“That first-half display was as poor as we’ve been in a year,” said Dyche. “There’s a huge gulf between where we are as a club and where they are, but we didn’t perform well in that period.”\n\nEngland’s third-choice goalkeeper would deny Costa twice more in the second half, Hazard from distance and César Azpilicueta at the death, with Terry also missing a sitter on the stretch, but this was an occasion when profligacy was not to be punished.\n\nChelsea 3-0 Burnley: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nWillian had eventually found his own reward just before the break, teasing space from Ward before spitting a shot through the full-back’s legs, across Heaton and into the net. This team functions better with the Brazilian’s own blend of trickery and industry from the right flank.\n\nVictor Moses eventually gave Willian a breather and duly registered a first league goal for the club since November 2012, thumping in Pedro’s tantalising cross at the far post. It was a goal to add gloss to the occasion. Conte’s side will face greater tests once the campaign resumes but, on this evidence, they will be eager to confront them.

his decision to leave Wilfried Zaha out of Crystal Palace’s starting lineup against Bournemouth was down to a belief the 23-year-old lacked focus.\n\nHe praised the forward, however, for overcoming his desire to leave for Tottenham and inspiring their comeback in the 1-1 draw that earned Palace’s first point of the Premier League season.\n\nOn Thursday Zaha asked Pardew to allow him to join Spurs, resulting in both the manager and chairman Steve Parish insisting they expected him to remain at the club.\n\nJoshua King’s fine 11th-minute finish gave visitors Bournemouth a deserved lead but after a flat first-half performance, Zaha’s 66th-minute introduction inspired both his team and Palace’s supporters, resulting in Scott Dann’s stoppage-time headed goal.\n\n“I made the decision on Friday [to drop Zaha],” said Pardew. “He’s a young lad, he’s been to Man United, he’s come here and done terrifically for us. Brilliant, our player of the year and for me, I would play him every game. Trust me, I didn’t want to leave him out.\n\n“But I had to understand the pressures that were on him as well. He had a very disruptive week and I thought it was only fair to him to see if we could get through the game, perhaps even without him, but we needed him and he was spot on for us.\n\n“He was terrific when he came on and he showed why the chairman made the statement he did [about Zaha staying].”\n\nAsked if he wished he had started the forward, Pardew responded: “I suppose in hindsight, when you’re only drawing at home. I can think of three or four things I would have liked to have done, particularly in the first half.\n\n“But you have to use your experience and he couldn’t have done any more for us in the period he was on the pitch and that’s all I can ask for. He didn’t take being a substitute badly at all. He understood that it was a disruptive week for him.\n\n“It wasn’t a punishment.

I was really pleased with some of our attacking play.\n\n“First half, you saw everything we’re about: the speed of our counterattack, the speed of our passing, we did very well.

As far as the officials are concerned, it demonstrates an inability to learn their lessons. For the second consecutive week, Stoke City were deemed guilty of failing to heed the new directives about grappling in the box. For a second successive Saturday, they conceded a spot kick that helped condemn them to defeat.\n\nHere, Leighton Baines’s penalty went in via a combination of the goalkeeper Shay Given and the post. Last week, Ryan Shawcross was penalised for grabbing Manchester City’s Nicolás Otamendi. When the referee, Michael Oliver, ruled Phil Bardsley shoved Ashley Williams, Stoke’s handiwork meant they slumped to the foot of the embryonic table.\n\nThey are winless and, in their eyes, luckless. “It has happened to me in the past with previous teams. Whenever there is a purge, teams like ourselves seem to get the thin end of the wedge,” lamented their manager, Mark Hughes, betraying the hints of a persecution complex.\n\n“We are being punished. Ashley Williams has gone down, whether he clipped his own heels or he has stepped across Phil Bardsley but there was no pushing and no pulling. Phil is very disappointed. It wasn’t instigated by him. I thought it was very harsh.”\n\nThe sympathetic Everton manager concurred. “I can understand why Mark Hughes is angry,” said Ronald Koeman after recording his first home league win. Both managers highlighted an incident earlier in the day at White Hart Lane, when Tottenham Hotspur’s Jan Vertonghen was only warned for tugging Liverpool’s Joël Matip. “That wasn’t given, maybe because it was two high-profile teams on the television and maybe they don’t get those penalties given against them,” Hughes lamented. A calmer Koeman stated: “That is not consistent.”\n\nTottenham 1-1 Liverpool: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nStoke were left contemplating requesting another meeting with the referees’ general manager, Mike Riley, or switching from man-marking, a staple of Hughes’s management, to zonal marking, or merely hoping referees will be less officious. “Hopefully it will settle down and everyone will revert to a bit of sanity,” Hughes said.\n\nYet he weakened his case to be seen as the voice of reason by claiming little separated the teams. “You look at the productivity with 18 shots and nine on target,” Koeman countered. “They had not one shot on target.”\n\nThat overlooked the moment, seven minutes after Baines’s penalty, when he volleyed the ball off his line after Marko Arnautovic’s effort was deflected on to the bar by Maarten Stekelenburg but it was a sign the Austrian posed the sole threat. Stoke seemed intent on a damage-limitation exercise. Hughes demoted Bojan Krkic to the bench in favour of a more physical attack. Its most conspicuous member was Peter Crouch, selected after an EFL Cup hat-trick at Stevenage but on a 15-month wait for a top-flight strike. Crouch has long demonstrated his agility in penalty boxes. Even at 35, he did so again to execute a spectacular clearance, hooking away Williams’s header and denying the £12m arrival a goal to mark his first league start.\n\nIt was sandwiched by two other goal‑saving interventions, each from Ryan Shawcross to thwart Romelu Lukaku. The Belgian delayed too long before shooting in the first half; in the second, he slipped the ball past the otherwise excellent Given before Shawcross’s rescue act. “Offensively we can do better,” Koeman said.\n\nArsenal’s Mesut Özil and Alexis Sánchez turn on style against Watford Read more\n\nIf Shawcross’s twin exercises in defiance indicated his powers of recovery, they also felt timely as Sam Allardyce watched on while he finalises his first England squad. Yet the Stoke captain’s struggle to contain Lukaku underlined the concern that a defender whose sole taste of international football was notable for Zlatan Ibrahimovic scoring four times can be found wanting against top-class strikers.\n\nHughes feels that the centre‑back’s reputation precedes him in other respects. Media coverage of grappling, he argued, is invariably illustrated by images of Shawcross. “He is not the only one but whenever it gets mentioned there is a picture of Ryan Shawcross,” he argued.\n\nKoeman had a more appealing view as he contemplated a league table that shows Everton third. “Maybe it is good to take a picture of that,” he said with a smile. Progress is being reflected in results. Stekelenburg, one of his signings, is performing so well that he sees little need to borrow Joe Hart. “He is not a third or second[-choice] goalkeeper.” He was defiant, too, in insisting that James McCarthy, who was omitted as Everton wait to discover if he needs groin surgery, is going nowhere. He said: “Players like McCarthy need to stay and we like to keep everybody.”"}, {"date": "27/08/2016", "arena": "The King Power Stadium", "attendance": 31727, "home_team": {"name": "Leicester City",

Premier League champions got their title defence up and running with a victory that was far more convincing than the scoreline suggests. Jamie Vardy registered his first goal of the season and Wes Morgan scored the second against a Swansea side that seemed resigned to defeat until Leroy Fer’s late header gave them a flicker of hope where there should have been none.\n\nLeicester ought to have been out of sight by the time Fer powerfully headed home in the 80th minute after a rare Swansea attack. Riyad Mahrez squandered a chance to put the game to bed shortly before the hour mark, however, with a poor penalty kick that Lukasz Fabianski saved, and it was a moment that Leicester were almost left to regret when Fer’s goal encouraged Swansea to push for an unlikely equaliser.\n\nTottenham and Danny Rose punish wasteful Liverpool to claim draw Read more\n\nIt was a strange ending to a game that finished in farcical conditions, with the incessant rain causing the ball to get stuck in puddles of water on a surface that was close to unplayable come the final five minutes. Yet Leicester weathered the late storm in more ways than one to hold on for Claudio Ranieri’s 100th Premier League win and an important three points before the international break.\n\nAny other outcome would have been an injustice, such was Leicester’s dominance – in particular in the opening 45 minutes. Vardy’s pace troubled Swansea throughout, Danny Drinkwater was excellent in central midfield – those two combined for the opening goal in a rerun of a move seen so many times last season – and Daniel Amartey, who had the monumental task of filling N’Golo Kanté’s boots, was full of energy and used the ball intelligently.\n\nRanieri was pleased to see Vardy on the scoresheet and also encouraged by a performance that was much more like the Leicester of last season. “Of course it’s important for strikers to score because it’s their life,” Leicester’s manager said. “I think the first half was outstanding for us but we have to score one more goal. The second half was also good. But after we missed a penalty maybe the opponent got more confident and we complicated life a little. It was tough. The rain was unbelievable. It was water polo. But three points is good – a first victory. So I am very, very happy.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Danny Drinkwater and Ki Sung-yueng battle for the ball as the rain comes down late in the game. Photograph: Nigel French/PA\n\nFrancesco Guidolin, the Italian in the opposite dugout, had nothing to smile about. Swansea were woeful for much of the match and on another day could have been on the end of a hiding. They looked vulnerable at the back, where Federico Fernández and Jordi Amat were an accident waiting to happen, were overrun in midfield and almost nonexistent as an attacking force until the final 10 minutes. Fernando Llorente looked an isolated and peripheral figure up front.\n\nThe fixture list does not exactly give much cause for optimism going forward. Swansea’s next five matches in the league see them host Chelsea, travel to Southampton, take on Manchester City at home and face Liverpool and Arsenal away. There will need to be a significant improvement to pick up points from that run and Borja Baston, the £15.5m club-record signing, could do with hitting the ground running when he recovers from injury.\n\nArsenal’s Mesut Özil and Alexis Sánchez turn on style against Watford Read more\n\nVardy’s opening goal had been on the cards for some time. The move started with some neat one-touch passing deep inside the Leicester half involving Drinkwater, Amartey and Mahrez. It was Mahrez’s cushioned header that found Drinkwater and there was only one thing in the midfielder’s mind when he looked up and saw the Swansea defence playing a high line. The through ball was executed perfectly, Vardy outpaced Amat and hammered a right-footed shot in off the near upright.\n\nMorgan doubled Leicester’s lead with a goal that was nothing like as refined but just as effective. Marc Albrighton’s corner was never dealt with by Swansea’s defence as Fer and Fernández challenged Robert Huth and Morgan. The ball came off Huth, rolled over Morgan’s shoulder and the Leicester captain thrashed a volley from the edge of the six-yard box past Fabianski.\n\nFootball clockwatch: Leicester 2-1 Swansea, Watford 1-3 Arsenal and more – live! Read more\n\nWith Swansea in disarray, Mahrez should have made it 3-0 four minutes later when Amat brought down Shinji Okazaki in the area, but the Algerian telegraphed his intentions and hit a weak penalty that Fabianski saved low to his right. It was a reprieve for Swansea and one that they took advantage of later in the game when Fer, climbing above Morgan, headed beyond Ron-Robert Zieler, who had replaced Kasper Schmeichel in goal after the Leicester keeper left the field with a hernia problem.\n\nSwansea, however, ultimately got what they deserved. “The result was a fair one, they played better than us,” Guidolin said. “In the first-half they played very, very well, they are strong like last season – good football with intensity. We prepared another kind of game, we didn’t play well.”"}, {"date": "27/08/2016", "arena": " Mary's Stadium", "attendance": 30152, "home_team": {"name": "Southampton", "lineup": [{"name": "Fraser

But Southampton were tamed time and again by the Sunderland back line, completed by Patrick van Aanholt and the debutant Javier Manquillo on the flanks at left and right-back respectively.\n\nSouthampton’s manager, Claude Puel, handed a first start of the season to Austin but he flattered to deceive and, unsurprisingly, appeared short of match fitness. Both Austin and Fonte sent wayward passes out of play to grumbles from a restless home crowd, who had little to cheer about until Rodriguez’s strike. Their first-half frustrations were compounded when Nathan Redmond was awarded a yellow card for dissent by the referee Lee Mason.\n\nAs the hosts huffed and puffed, Sunderland grew into a drab affair, lit up by sparks of clever play from a front three of Defoe, Fabio Borini and Adnan Januzaj. Defoe, though not in his heyday, remains the sharpest tool in the box available to Moyes and the evergreen striker deserved his goal, lashing home from the penalty spot and beyond the Southampton goalkeeper, Fraser Forster. Defoe caused panic in the Southampton defence and his manager, Moyes, believes he can still do so on the international stage. Asked whether Defoe could be included in Sam Allardyce’s England squad, Moyes replied: “I wouldn’t be surprised at all because he’s a goalscorer. Sam knows him better than me but he’s a good pro and he wants to do things right.”\n\nSunderland’s six-year wait for a league win in August goes on but there are plenty of positive signs, namely the young performers Pickford, the 20-year-old Lynden Gooch and the substitute Duncan Watmore. Pickford had twice saved well in the second half from Shane Long and Redmond before eventually coming undone against Rodriguez, who was hauled on by Puel as a last throw of the dice.\n\nA loan move to West Bromwich Albion had been mooted for Rodriguez, who has struggled for regular football since returning from an anterior cruciate ligament injury. Despite his late equaliser, Puel refused to rule out the striker leaving the club before Wednesday’s transfer deadline.\n\n“It’s important to listen and have a good discussion with him for the future,” said Puel. “We will see in the next days. I am happy for Jay to score this afternoon and after his injuries, it was important for him to come back and score.”"}, {"date": "27/08/2016", "arena": "Vicarage Road", "attendance": 20545, "home_team": {"name": "Watford", "lineup": [{"name": "Heurelho Gomes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Younes Kaboul", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sebastian Prödl", "yellows": [17], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Kabasele", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [52]}, {"name": "Nordin Amrabat", "yellows": [77], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [77]}, {"name": "Adlene Guedioura", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Valon Behrami", "yellows": [83], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Etienne Capoue", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "José Holebas", "yellows": [89], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Odion Ighalo", "yellows": [45], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Troy Deeney", "yellows": [60], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Daryl Janmaat", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [52], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Isaac Success", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [77], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Juan Camilo Zuniga", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jerome Sinclair", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Watson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Costel Pantilimon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Roberto Pereyra", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [57], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Arsenal", "lineup": [{"name": "Petr Cech", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Hector Bellerin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rob Holding", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Laurent Koscielny", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nacho Monreal", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [74]}, {"name": "Santi Cazorla", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [9], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Granit Xhaka", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Theo Walcott", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mesut Özil", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [45], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [70]}, {"name": "Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [70]}, {"name": "Alexis Sánchez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [40], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Kieran Gibbs", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [74], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Wilshere", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [70], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Olivier Giroud", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Ospina", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Calum Chambers", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Francis Coquelin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mohamed Elneny", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [70], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Panic over. After a frustrating start to the season Arsenal have finally flourished, outclassing Watford in a first half they illuminated with excellent approach play and clinical finishing. The only significant criticism would be the failure to sustain their superiority for the full 90 minutes, allowing a home side that had been humbled before half-time to find a measure of encouragement in the latter stagesbut though the Hornets wrestled their way back into the contest they never looked likely to avoid losing it.\n\nOn Friday Wenger had been asked whether his recent transfer dealings – for Shkodran Mustafi and Lucas Pérez – were motivated by desperation. “Look at my face,” he responded. “Is this the face of someone who tends to panic?”\n\nArsène Wenger praises returning Mesut Özil in Arsenal victory over Watford Read more\n\nA day later he might have enjoyed the expressions on a few Watford defenders as his side displayed the kind of creativity and ruthlessness that would have even their manager’s harshest critics purring.\n\nMesut Özil, who made his first start of the season, was at the heart of much of their finest football, with Alexis Sánchez also outstanding, winning a penalty, claiming an assist and scoring a goal of his own against an unfamiliar, and unconvincing, Watford back three.\n\nThe patched-up nature of Arsenal’s defence had been a feature of the early season but this time it was their opponents’ rearguard that was significantly weakened. With Craig Cathcart injured and Miguel Britos given leave to attend the birth of his child, there were league debuts for Younès Kaboul and Christian Kabasele, who played either side of the mountainous Austrian Sebastian Prödl. “Today, at the last minute, we lost two starters,” said Walter Mazzarri. “In a squad that is being built and is growing game by game it is difficult to cope, and there were some mistakes.”\n\nChelsea have menacing look as Victor Moses completes defeat of Burnley Read more\n\nArsenal swiftly worked out a way through the restructured backline, with the first hint of the trouble ahead coming in the sixth minute when Sánchez’s chipped pass found Özil bursting into the area but offside. Two minutes later the pair repeated the trick in reverse, Özil this time lofting the ball into the box, but before the Chilean could bring it under control he was caught by Nordin Amrabat’s elbow. Kevin Friend took so long to give the penalty Watford had assumed there would not be one, and on the touchline Mazzarri burst into furious gesticulations when the referee finally pointed to the spot. The Italian refused to directly address the award after the game but spoke about “two episodes that nobody in the stadium really understood”, presumably also referring to the bewildering decision to penalise Amrabat for taking the ball past Laurent Koscielny on the right wing in the 37th minute.\n\nUndeterred, Santi Cazorla stroked his penalty down the middle to kickstart a difficult first half for the home side. However it took another 25 minutes before Özil and Sánchez combined again with any real menace, as a smart one-two on the edge of the penalty area led to a low shot from Sánchez that was saved by Heurelho Gomes.\n\nFootball clockwatch: Leicester 2-1 Swansea, Watford 1-3 Arsenal and more – as it happened Read more\n\nIn the intervening period Watford had occasionally threatened, with Amrabat particularly industrious on the right. It was from one of his crosses that Watford came closest to an equaliser though it was Koscielny who nearly scored it, his miscued clearance forcing Petr Cech into a smart save.\n\nHaving fought their way to an approximation of parity on the run of play, the last five minutes of the first half turned out to be very long ones for Watford. First they were sliced open by an excellent, swift counterattack which ended with Sánchez mis-hitting Theo Walcott’s fine cross goalwards, the ball bouncing just over the line before it was cleared. Then in the final moments of stoppage time Sánchez was given a preposterous amount of time and space on the left wing, and he was the only player on the pitch to spot Özil’s late sprint into the penalty area. His centre was precise, and appropriately despatched.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Alexis Sánchez’s mishit effort squeezes over the line to give Arsenal a two-goal cushion. Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Reuters\n\nMazzarri brought on Roberto Pereyra, the recent arrival from Juventus, at half-time – he said he did this “to try to surprise Arsenal” though having him spend half-time warming up on the pitch rather gave the game away – while Daryl Janmaat and the deposed record signing Isaac Success also made their debuts from the bench. Their arrivals, and a switch to a back four, galvanised the side and they scored when Janmaat’s cross was half-cleared to Étienne Capoue, whose blocked shot fell to Pereyra, who took a touch and found the corner from eight yards.\n\nThereafter Odion Ighalo twice came close to bringing if not panic then at least a flicker of concern to Wenger’s face, but with a lead to protect the Gunners were increasingly content to contain and occasionally break.

Phelan knows all about Manchester United’s knack of scoring last-gasp goals.\n\nHull City’s caretaker manager must have celebrated countless such winners but he could certainly have done without Marcus Rashford’s clincher here. Perhaps determined to make José Mourinho and Sam Allardyce sit up and take notice, the young England striker with an electric change of pace altered the game after stepping off the substitutes’ bench and steering in Wayne Rooney centre from close range.\n\nWith a single, decisive kick, a superbly defiant Hull – for whom Curtis Davies was imperious in central defence – were brought back to earth. Phelan had said expecting his 14 fit senior professionals to defeat United’s £200m worth of talent might be “delusional” but when David Meyler very nearly scored a shock 89th-minute effort of his own Hull almost did precisely that.\n\nHull City v Manchester United: Premier League – live! Read more\n\n“I was expecting a difficult match,” said Mourinho whose side have yet to drop a point. “At half-time I told them we were playing against a very organised Hull with an amazing spirit and our play had to be intense. We needed a bit of luck to score but I think we deserved it completely. And Rashford is very good. He gave us diversity. He’s going to play a lot of matches.”\n\nPhelan was sanguine. “It’s disappointing and I feel for my players but we lost a bit of concentration, maybe it was fatigue,” he said. “We performed magnificently in all departments, we just ran out of steam. We need to add to the squad.”\n\nBut will he be able to when the club are in the process of being taken over by a Chinese consortium with another set of rival bidders hovering in the background? “We’ve got offers in for players,” Phelan said, “but getting them is touch and go.”\n\nThe midfield contest proved similarly, and unexpectedly, tight with Marouane Fellaini and Paul Pogba – collectively 12ft 7in – being frequently second guessed by Hull’s rather more averagely built midfielder Sam Clucas.\n\nAdmittedly there were moments when Clucas – ably supported by Tom Huddlestone and Meyler – was outmuscled by the more athletic Pogba but generally he proved a big reason why United rarely troubled Eldin Jakupovic during the first half. Apart from watching a header from Zlatan Ibrahimovic fly fractionally over his bar following the striker’s connection with Anthony Martial’s cross, the goalkeeper had relatively little to do.\n\nLeicester survive late scare against Swansea to secure first win of season Read more\n\nHeavy rain was testing the waterproof powers of Mourinho’s overcoat when Robert Snodgrass stepped forward to hit a free-kick from almost 30 yards. As it curled in, David de Gea remained motionless and must have been mighty relieved to see it brush the outside of a post.\n\nShortly afterwards, Huddlestone’s wonderful long pass sparked a Hull counterattack that concluded with Andrew Robertson crossing and Luke Shaw intercepting quite brilliantly as Snodgrass prepared to pounce at the far post. Unfortunately the winger, whose presence had restricted Shaw’s ability to start attacks from left-back, ended up colliding with the upright and injuring a calf.\n\nWith Snodgrass suddenly a passenger, United regrouped. When Jakupovic could only parry Juan Mata’s cross, the hitherto anonymous Rooney looked set to score only for Davies to chest the ball off the line.\n\nAlthough United had plenty of possession and Hull’s attacking game could not exactly be described as ambitious, Phelan must have been delighted by the way his team contained their guests with Davies’s minding of Ibrahimovic emblematic of this collective smothering.\n\nWith Snodgrass forced off by that earlier injury minutes into the second half and Fellaini arguably fortunate not to have received a second booking for what looked suspiciously like a clearcut case of dissent, United began to settle.\n\nShay Given’s own goal gives dominant Everton victory over Stoke Read more\n\nRecognising that things were still not quite right, Mourinho replaced Martial with Henrikh Mkhitaryan and the newcomer’s intricate passing immediately helped bring the best out of Ibrahimovic. That said United’s lone striker had already done more than most to raise the tone, one glorious volleyed backheel flick which found Mata offside lingering in the memory.\n\nA goal stubbornly refused to materialise and Rashford replaced Mata, although some United fans may rather have seen Rooney taken off. Shortly afterwards a wonderful save from Jakupovic denied Rashford, whose shot passed through Jake Livemore’s legs.\n\nDespite being forced ever deeper by Rashford’s skill and speed, Hull were still in it. Huddlestone’s shot deflected off Eric Bailly and flew tantalisingly off target with De Gea wrong-footed before Meyler fired narrowly over.\n\nThen, just as dusk closed in on Mourinho’s technical area,

Quite apart from securing Middlesbrough’s first victory since their return to Premier League combat, the ruthless Uruguayan offered Ellis Short, Sunderland’s watching owner, a timely reminder that without substantial investment by the end of the month his club will surely be in acute danger of relegation.\n\nThis was not the home debut David Moyes had hoped for when he succeeded Sam Allardyce last month but Sunderland’s new manager deserves praise for making the best of some extremely threadbare resources.\n\nA chronic lack of significant summer investment had already left them short in every department before Younès Kaboul defected to Watford on Friday and Lamine Koné to all intents went on strike with a mysterious back injury in an attempt to force through a transfer to Everton.\n\nSunderland’s high press leaves shaky defence exposed against Middlesbrough | Michael Cox Read more\n\nMoyes told the Ivory Coast defender to stay away on Sunday but he and Kaboul were much missed. Indeed, when John O’Shea succumbed to a groin injury, Jack Rodwell was forced to deputise at the back. This reshuffle left Moyes without a recognised central midfielder on the pitch for the majority of the team’s second successive defeat.\n\nAsked about a growing consensus that Sunderland will inevitably be involved in yet another relegation fight this season, their brutally realistic, extremely downbeat manager did not disagree. “They’re probably right,” he said. “That’s what they’ve had for the last four years, so why should it change? I don’t think we can hide the facts – yes, that will probably be the case.\n\n“People will be flat because they’re hoping something is going to dramatically change here – but it can’t, can it? Getting the right players at the right price in the transfer market is difficult.”\n\nAitor Karanka cut a contrasting figure. “We have a lot of quality players,” Boro’s manager said. “We’ve shown we’re ready for the Premier League.” Karanka adores rotation and duly refreshed his right flank where Stuani replaced Albert Adomah. It swiftly proved an inspired switch, with the South American giving Boro the lead against the run of play.\n\nThat goal originated with a slapdash concession of possession on the part of Papy Djilobodji. Making his Premier League debut following an £8m switch from Chelsea, the Senegal centre-half subsequently saw Stuani collect Álvaro Negredo’s pass around 25 yards out and advance to the edge of the area before sending an unstoppable right-foot shot swerving beyond Vito Mannone and into the top corner. It was a glorious finish but Djilobodji had neglected to close the attacking midfielder down.\n\nYet if Boro fans were heartened by the knowledge their team has never lost when Stuani has scored, they must have been slightly unnerved to see Sunderland’s Manchester United loanee, Adnan Januzaj, causing Karanka’s defence – and George Friend in particular – numerous problems from his right-wing station. Friend seemed nonplussed by the Belgian’s fancy footwork but was reprieved by his lack of end product.\n\nWest Ham v Bournemouth: Premier League – live! Read more\n\nAlthough Jermain Defoe did deposit the ball in the back of the net, that disallowed goal was well offside and the tide already appeared to be turning against Moyes.\n\nEven before O’Shea hobbled off the Scot must have been alarmed by the way Donald Love, his young right-back, struggled against Stewart Downing.\n\nO’Shea was replaced by Steven Pienaar, newly signed on a one-year contract, with Rodwell dropping back into central defence. Unfortunately for Rodwell, he was soon duped by Negredo in the preamble to Stuani’s second goal.\n\nIt started with an excellent reverse pass from Adam Forshaw who, having played a one-two with Gastón Ramírez, supplied Negredo. He sold Rodwell a dummy before cueing up the unattended Stuani to dispatch a cushioned, close- range shot into the roof of the net.\n\nAt this point Brad Guzan, Boro’s goalkeeper who was deputising for Víctor Valdés, was underemployed as Sunderland launched far too many aimless long balls for Antonio Barragán and Ben Gibson to gobble up.\n\nIndeed as the home side were loudly booed off at half-time the cover of Legion of Light, the club magazine, appeared especially unfortunate. Adorned by a large picture of Koné it inquired: “Is David The Moyesiah?”\n\nNo messiah could expect to succeed with a central midfield as weak as Sunderland’s and, abandoning all pretence of fielding a proper one, Moyes replaced Paddy McNair with Jeremain Lens, a winger, for the second half.\n\nThe only puzzle was why Wahbi Khazri remained on the bench. After all, the £9m Tunisia winger proved a key reason why the Wearsiders avoided relegation last season. Without him Sunderland flattered to deceive as Boro retreated into their defensive shells and ceded plenty of possession. Granted Lynden Gooch saw a shot blocked by Emilio Nsue, fine defending on Gibson’s part denied Defoe and Guzan saved Patrick van Aanholt’s stinging drive smartly but it all smacked of papering over profound cracks.\n\nEventually, though, Boro retreated far too deep and suddenly seemed unable to escape their own penalty area, let alone their own half. When Guzan failed to hold Duncan Watmore’s low shot, Van Aanholt redirected the loose ball into the back of the net.\n\nWith the impressive Pienaar somehow holding the midfield together, Watmore showing real menace and Gooch winning some impressive tackles, a pacey Sunderland temporarily exceeded the sum of their parts but even so Guzan should not have spilled Watmore’s shot.\n\n“We’ve got some good young players and actually played quite well at times,” said Moyes. “But we have to turn things round.”\n\nMan of the match Cristhian Stuani (Middlesbrough)"}, {"date": "21/08/2016",

stress or apprehension on his face. Antonio, after all, endured a night of torture during West Ham’s defeat to Chelsea last week, clumsily giving away a penalty before storming down the tunnel after being substituted by Slaven Bilic, and there was every chance that he would be the story again.\n\nPerhaps it was not a surprise to see Antonio smile after he spotted the cameraman hovering nearby, however, given that he was back in his favourite position on the wing after struggling so badly as a right-back at Stamford Bridge. And confirmation that this was to be a tale of redemption for a player with a big heart arrived when a reminder of his goalscoring instincts punctured the growing tension at West Ham’s new home.\n\nThere were five minutes remaining when Antonio settled a dreary contest against a strangely subdued Bournemouth, leaping imperiously at the far post to meet Gokhan Tore’s cross, and a goal that rarely looked as though it was on the cards ensured that Bilic’s side tasted victory in their first Premier League fixture at the London Stadium.\n\nThis was a crucial win for West Ham, bearing in mind that the absence of seven players forced them to reach deep into their reserves of togetherness and spirit in order to find a way past Bournemouth. They huffed and puffed without reward for long spells and ultimately a game that was desperately lacking in entertainment in front of a crowd of 57,000 hinged on the moment when Eddie Howe’s lacklustre side were reduced to 10 men when Harry Arter was sent off with 13 minutes left.\n\nHowe had no complaints about the dismissal, admitting that the midfielder had been foolish to argue with the referee’s decision after being penalised for handball in the first half. The Football Association has introduced new rules regarding dissent and the midfielder paid the price when he brought an illegal end to a surge from Cheikhou Kouyaté in the second half. “We are well aware that dissent will be a yellow card,” Bournemouth’s manager said. “That’s the one that burns. I have drilled it into them.”\n\nBournemouth had been comfortable with 11 men, restricting West Ham to few clear opportunities, but they were ragged after losing Arter. Bilic sensed they were vulnerable, reacting by introducing Ashley Fletcher alongside Jonathan Calleri in attack, and the breakthrough arrived when Tore hung a fine cross towards the far post. Charlie Daniels was no match for Antonio, who bullied the left-back before powering a header past Artur Boruc.\n\n“It was good for him, a great moment for the club,” Bilic said. “It was also very important for him because of the mistake he made against Chelsea. It’s a game of mistakes. That was more mentality, that you can’t do at this level. That mistake had nothing to do with the position he played.”\n\nDespite his defensive limitations, Bilic had persisted with using Antonio as a right-back until the Chelsea game. The experiment has produced mixed results and West Ham were more solid with Antonio further forward and Sam Byram in defence. Bilic, however, wants his players to put the team first.\n\n“It’s not democracy, it’s more important what the team requires,” West Ham’s manager said. “Rule number one is you have to be humble and sacrifice for your team. He did it last year. It’s going to be mixed. He would probably be a good centre forward because of his pace. But he’s going to play where the team needs [him].”\n\nWhat pleased Bilic most about this win was that it was achieved without their most incisive attackers. Sofiane Feghouli is not expected to return until after the international break and Dimitri Payet was unavailable after failing a fitness test because of a minor knock.\n\nWest Ham 1-0 Bournemouth: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\n“This is the new, modern West Ham,” Karren Brady announced in a video that flashed on the big screens during the buildup in this shiny, slightly disorienting bowl of a stadium, but the boldness of that message from the vice-chairman was somewhat diluted by persistent reminders of the old West Ham. The day began with news of another injury for Andy Carroll, hardly the tonic Bilic required after losing the club’s new record signing, André Ayew, until Christmas because of a torn thigh muscle.\n\nMiddlesbrough sink Sunderland with Cristhian Stuani double Read more\n\nBilic’s optimistic prediction is that Carroll will return from his knee injury in four weeks and Payet and Manuel Lanzini may be available for the second leg of West Ham’s Europa League play-off against Astra Giurgiu on Thursday. On this evidence, they need them. Tore’s end-product was frustrating until the Turkish winger conjured the assist for Antonio, while Enner Valencia rarely looked capable of ending a goal drought that stretches back to January. The Ecuadorian was booed off after being replaced by Calleri, who was promising despite spurning a glorious chance in stoppage time.\n\nThe Argentinian’s miss came moments after Adrián had made a spectacular save to deny Joshua King an equaliser. Yet Bournemouth were uninspired, providing Callum Wilson with little service. King was unlucky to see Adrián save another effort from 25 yards but their bluntness in attack was encapsulated by Jordan Ibe’s failure to shoot when he was through on goal early in the second half. That was the difference. “One moment of quality and we’re punished,” Howe said.\n\nMan of the match Michail Antonio (West Ham United)"}, {"date": "20/08/2016", "arena": "Bet365 Stadium", "attendance":

that served as a reminder that the home of Stoke remains an intimidating venue for visiting opponents. The crowd is boisterous, the conditions are gusty and the team in red and white are no mugs. Yet none of that could stop Manchester City from recording a victory that maintains their perfect start under Pep Guardiola and suggests they are indeed intent on making their mark on all fronts this season.\n\nThe visitors came through a frantic and full-blooded affair that was a throwback to the days when Tony Pulis was in charge of Stoke and those occasions, like last season, when City found themselves overwhelmed at the ground now known as the bet365 Stadium. But here City played with poise, grit and a level of ruthlessness that enabled them largely to dominate proceedings and make it 11 goals scored in three matches.\n\nSergio Agüero has six of those having added two goals here to the one he got against Sunderland on the first day of the season and the hat-trick he scored in the 5-0 blitz of Steaua Bucharest in midweek. The opener was a penalty, one of two awarded by the referee, Mike Dean, who was simply enforcing to the letter the directives issued prior to the new campaign for officials to be tougher on grappling inside the area. Ryan Shawcross was penalised for the incident that led to Agüero opening the scoring, with Raheem Sterling the man punished prior to Bojan Krkic converting for Stoke shortly after half-time.\n\nDean has developed a reputation for trying to make himself the centre of attention yet he made the correct call on both incidents and the only black spot in regards to his performance was his failure to award Stoke a penalty after Aleksandar Kolarov clearly fouled Joe Allen inside the City area shortly before half-time. That could have proved a decisive moment but ultimately the visitors deserved their victory, one decorated by two late close-range goals from the substitute Nolito.\n\n“We suffer five minutes after they score but after that they didn’t create many chances and we had a great performance,” said Guardiola. “It is impossible to come here and for 90 minutes control the game but we created a lot and we saw again amazing team spirit.”\n\nThere was a clear resilience running through the visitors’ ranks and perhaps no single moment typified that better than when Jesús Navas charged back into his own area on 58 minutes to prevent Marko Arnautovic from having a shot on goal. A player not renowned for his battling qualities was suddenly transformed into Tony Adams.\n\nAnd while City may not have performed with the swagger they displayed against Bucharest there was still much to admire in the way the team continued to build from the back, the centre-backs John Stones and Nicolas Otamendi splitting and playing the ball into midfield where David Silva and Kevin De Bruyne used it with intelligence and craft. Sterling, meanwhile, continues to dazzle and watching on from the bench yet again, Joe Hart could only contemplate what he will be missing should the goalkeeper, as expected, leave City before the end of the month.\n\nThat is not to say Stoke were overwhelmed and for large parts of the first half they matched City’s high-pressing tactics with their own desire to regain the ball and use it progressively, typified best by Allen, who was making his first start for Stoke since arriving from Liverpool.“We saw the energy and understanding of his game,” said Mark Hughes of the Wales midfielder. “I was pleased he was able to excel.”\n\nStoke’s battling was undone on 27 minutes when Shawcross was spotted grabbing Otamendi’s arm as the Argentinian looked to connect with De Bruyne’s corner. Agüero sent Shay Given the wrong way from the spot – a form of redemption given the striker missed two penalties in midweek – and scored again nine minutes later after glancing in De Bruyne’s free-kick from an unmarked position inside the six-yard area.\n\nThe hosts went from fired-up to frustrated and even more so after Dean failed to spot Kolarov’s man-handling of Allen. Yet they were back in the match on 49 minutes after the referee this time spotted an infringement by a City player - Sterling put his hands on Shawcross as he attacked an Allen corner, and while the contact was minimal it was an infringement.\n\n“We know the directives and last year those penalties would not have been awarded,” said Hughes. “As long as the referees are consistent I haven’t got an issue with that but from experience I doubt that will be the case.”\n\nGuardiola described the penalty decisions as “a little strange” yet ultimately he departed from here a happy man. “It is impossible to say what we can achieve but in the short time together, they [the players] show me how intelligent they are,” he said. “They have a lot of quality.”\n\nPep Guardiola hopes to sign Barcelona’s Claudio Bravo this week Read more\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Nolito scores Manchester City’s third goal, and his first, in the win against Stoke.

Sean Dyche’s men were simply hungrier than the visiting team who lacked the requisite quality in front of goal. Burnley’s manager offered a telling criticism of his opponents.\n\n“At times Liverpool had six men in midfield,” he said. “I think if I put six in midfield we’d probably keep the ball a long time. But we want to penetrate.” His side did and on this evidence Burnley have a fighting chance of staying up and Liverpool are destined for another frustrating campaign.\n\nJürgen Klopp used the correct term when despairing of the result. “We had absolutely no luck and everybody needs to be more clinical,” he said. “We have to accept it. Burnley deserved to win with a very passionate performance.\n\n“We have to say it was not enough today. The lesson here is – don’t give the ball away like we did twice today. We will work on it 100%.”\n\nBurnley had the dream start, which meant Liverpool’s was a nightmare. Two minutes in Nathaniel Clyne’s sloppy pass ceded possession to Andre Gray. He turned the ball to Sam Vokes and a swift swivel then emphatic 20-yard shot gave Simon Mignolet little chance.\n\nVictor Wanyama strikes late for Tottenham to see off Crystal Palace Read more\n\nThis rocked Liverpool, who soon needed a last-ditch Dejan Lovren intervention to avoid going two behind. This time Gray raced clear and at the Liverpool goalkeeper. As the No7 went to pull the trigger in dived Lovren to take the ball cleanly and the danger was gone.\n\nThe wild conditions swirling round Turf Moor were being matched by the up-and-at-’em approach of Dyche’s team. Each time Burnley poured forward their fans roared them on and to Liverpool’s credit they attempted to gain the foothold that would stymie the onslaught.\n\nTheir end-product when nearing Tom Heaton’s goal was deficient, however. Twice Philippe Coutinho was wasteful. The Clarets could again charge at the neon-green shirts with Gray often hit early with a long pass.\n\nDean Marney, partnering Burnley’s record signing, Steven Defour, in midfield, led the press whenever he could. Jordan Henderson was left embarrassed when Marney mugged him near his area and Adam Lallana blushed when he later fell over in possession.\n\nDefour was the single change from last weekend’s 1-0 defeat here by Swansea City as the £7.5m man replaced David Jones, who is now at Sheffield Wednesday.\n\nAs Jones was the sole difference from the XI that ended last season – for Joey Barton – Dyche is beginning a second term leading Burnley in the top flight by showing faith in those who won promotion from the Championship.\n\nFor Klopp, his main moves from last Sunday’s 4-3 win at Arsenal were to drop the beleaguered Alberto Moreno for James Milner at left-back and select Daniel Sturridge for the injured Sadio Mané.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Andre Gray doubles Burnley’s lead moments before half-time. Photograph: Scott Heppell/Reuters\n\nFrom a short corner taken by Coutinho Lallana took aim but failed to finish. Then Milner and Sturridge linked along the left before switching play right and the move fizzled out.\n\nLater Coutinho sprayed a regulation pass beyond Milner and out. It was a microcosm of where Liverpool were failing; their edge was blunt, rather than cutting.\n\nGray then struck to send the ground into raptures and Liverpool staring at a 2-0 half-time deficit. Ragnar Klavan lost the ball near halfway, Defour skipped forward, passed right to Gray and, after he cut inside, the finish was as sweet as Vokes’s. This had the faithful singing: “We love you Burnley.” It had Klopp standing stony-faced. And it meant his team needed to show considerable backbone if they were to engineer the comeback.\n\nIf, during the break, Klopp sternly informed his charges to be more ruthless, that would have been no surprise.\n\nAfter the interval Liverpool’s slickest move thus far came when Sturridge danced inside and spread panic in Burnley’s area. A further warning that the visitors were finally sparking came when Heaton had to save sharply Roberto Firmino’s 20-yard attempt to the keeper’s left.\n\nThis ascendancy was the tale of Liverpool’s second half. A further scare came when Heaton misjudged a Milner corner from the left before the keeper scrambled to tip it behind.\n\nTo turn this superiority into goals Klopp replaced Sturridge with Divock Origi on 63 minutes. Yet Liverpool still disappointed while dominating.\n\nIt is early days but these are the games any team with the title-winning pretensions Klopp is voicing have to win."}, {"date": "20/08/2016",

expects the Hull board to make the right decision over the appointment of a full-time Tigers manager.\n\nHe took temporary charge last month following the departure of Steve Bruce and, despite having only 13 senior players available, secured a second straight Premier League win at Swansea .\n\nPromoted Hull built on their impressive 2-1 victory over the champions, Leicester City, with the substitute Shaun Maloney and Abel Hernández scoring in the final 12 minutes. Phelan says he can fulfil his ambition of landing the job on a full-time basis only by winning matches.\n\n“I am sure the people in charge will do the right thing,” said Phelan after Hull made it six points from six. “I think everyone knows we have decisions to make on my future, the future of the staff and the ownership.\n\n“Hopefully those decisions will be taken soon. It could be a busy time.”\n\nThe travelling Hull fans were in no doubt they want Phelan, the former Manchester United assistant manager, to succeed Bruce on a full-time basis.\n\nAs they secured their first top-flight away victory since winning at Crystal Palace in April 2015 the fans sang “We want Phelan in”.\n\n“It was nice to hear them singing that,” said Phelan. “It’s better than hearing them singing ‘we want Phelan out’.\n\n“I am sure if I do stay I will get the white handkerchiefs at some stage this season. But all I can do is win football matches and at this moment in time that’s what we are doing.\n\n“Credit to the players, they stuck to their tasks, got the result and I’m delighted for everyone. You have to have belief in your players and your football club, although my experience tells me not to get too carried away.\n\n“A lot has gone on but I haven’t had to shield the players from anything. They have just done a great job.”\n\nThe Swansea manager, Francesco Guidolin, had seen his side win their opening game at Burnley but after an encouraging opening half, in which they might have had two penalties, Swansea went down cul-de-sacs after the break and the Hull goalkeeper, Eldin Jakupovic, had little to do. “I am disappointed with that,” said Guidolin.\n\n“My dream was to win and I wanted to be on top of the table. The new owners were here - we had a meeting with them yesterday - and I am disappointed for them to see us lose in our first home game for them.\n\n“Today was not a good day. But there are no excuses. It’s a step back and we have to return to our work on the training field.”\n\nSwansea conceded regularly from set pieces last season and were undone again in that department when Curtis Davies helped on Robert Snodgrass’s corner and Maloney pounced from close range. “We have to improve at set pieces,” said Guidolin.\n\n“It’s important we do that and I am confident in my players.”"}, {"date":

There will be 18 further home league games at White Hart Lane but already the old stadium is diminished – the north-east corner gone, revealing girders, scaffolding, Portakabins, a wooden fence and a dark hut on which was scrawled the words “LIVE SUB”. Sure enough, it was the liveliness of the substitute Dele Alli that turned a game that had seemed to be slipping away from Tottenham.\n\nBurnley and Sam Vokes catch Liverpool cold as Klopp’s men fire blanks Read more\n\nHe was not directly involved in the winner, nodded in from close range by Victor Wanyama with seven minutes remaining after Harry Kane had headed on Érik Lamela’s corner, but his sharp pass had initiated the move that won the corner and it was his energy and sense of purpose that dragged Tottenham out of a mire of diffidence and self-doubt.\n\nAlli had been ill during the week and did not train on Tuesday or Wednesday but his omission was at least partly tactical as Mauricio Pochettino Kane behind Vincent Janssen. “We cannot play with 12 or 13 players,” Pochettino said. “If we want to play with two strikers it’s impossible to play with everybody. We have a lot of games ahead.”\n\nPochettino said he was happy with Janssen’s performance, although he did skew a glorious chance wide after 70 minutes after he had been put through by a deft flick from Alli, the substitute’s first touch. Having a squad that allows him to play two strikers is “an important option for the future”, Pochettino said.\n\nThat Spurs got the job done and found a way to win can be taken as a major positive – a reminder of how much Pochettino has done to eradicate the Spursiness that has afflicted the club for so long – but there will need to be significant improvement if Tottenham are to repeat last season’s title challenge. There was a disjointedness about them, a lack of fluidity, for which Palace are due some credit for their discipline and organisation.\n\n“I was happy with the performance,” Pochettino said. “We created a lot of chances in the first half and was disappointed because we didn’t score. It was a game where there’s not much to correct at half-time. It was a good thing that the team fought to the end, never gave up and always believed it was possible to win.”\n\nThere was some misfortune for Palace in the goal, with Damien Delaney forced off with an ankle injury sustained in conceding the corner. He clearly wanted to stay on after receiving lengthy treatment but he would not have been allowed on the pitch for the corner anyway. James Tomkins came off the bench and, as Alan Pardew put it, was “cold”, finding himself blocked in.\n\n“It was a sickener really,” Pardew said. “A corner when we were really being stretched because they were good at corners today. The players gave everything. There was a bit more verve and bit more industry in our play. We had a good spell and, when you come to places like Tottenham, you’ve got to score in that spell.”\n\nThat is what he hopes Christian Benteke, whose signing was not completed in time for him to play, will bring. “There’s one thing that always impressed me about him,” said Pardew. “He gets the goals you expect but every now and again he gets a rabbit out of the hat – just one moment that can change the course of a game.”\n\nIt is true, of course, that solidity plus a high-class striker can take a side a long way. The worrying aspect for Palace, though, is Pardew’s habit of leading his team into slumps from which they cannot escape.

This was a second successive win secured late, courtesy of a goal from Diego Costa, with Watford left as deflated as West Ham United had been five days earlier. Dig deeper, though, and the visitors’ ability to recover from a rather disjointed display and claim success felt rather more significant. It was a demonstration of clout.\n\nConte, for all his frustrations with the transfer market and his intention still to recruit, had the depth of quality on his bench to erode the hosts’ authority. He could fling on Michy Batshuayi, plucked from Marseille for £33.1m this summer, in partnership with Costa to force Chelsea level, and inject Victor Moses’s energy on the flank where Pedro Rodríguez had been rather aimless. Most of all, he could introduce the class and invention of Cesc Fàbregas, against opponents who had just started to doubt themselves, to provide a winner.\n\nFàbregas, unused on Monday, was flung on for the final 12 minutes here and in effect changed the complexion of the game. Watford were distracted by his presence, infuriated by the needle the Spaniard injects into the challenge and wary of his ability to thread a pass through the clutter. Where Eden Hazard had previously been forced deep to seek out the ball and exert any kind of influence, now the Belgian felt liberated, with Fàbregas drawing the attention elsewhere. It was Hazard’s low shot, spat from distance, that Heurelho Gomes spilled for Batshuayi to ram in the equaliser.\n\nThe striker already boasts a goal, an assist and a shot thundered against the woodwork in stoppage time, from 22 minutes as a Premier League player. Yet, while he is already forging a reputation in this league, Fàbregas is seeking to justify his. His most significant contribution here was reserved until three minutes from time. Collecting possession in a blur just outside his own penalty area, the midfielder sprayed a glorious angled pass downfield that split the back-tracking Craig Cathcart and Sebastian Prödl for a galloping Costa to gather. The striker trundled on and slipped his shot through Gomes’s legs as the goalkeeper advanced.\n\n“We all know Cesc, that he is a great player with a great technique, always with a good pass and assist,” said Conte. “I made this substitution because, at that moment, I saw Watford were thinking only about defending. So I was happy with Cesc’s impact, and I’m pleased with his attitude. He’s working very hard in training to show he deserves to play. If I see that attitude and commitment, I’m very happy.”\n\nBoth provider and scorer had been engulfed by gleeful team-mates while Conte celebrated manically on the sidelines. It had taken Chelsea six matches to register six points last term. This year, they boast that tally after two.\n\nThe seated Walter Mazzarri glanced briefly in his compatriot’s direction, reluctant as he was to offer up a reaction. These two have history from their time in charge of Napoli and Juventus respectively pursuing the Scudetto back home and, for a while here, the Watford manager must have dared to believe he could condemn Conte to his first defeat in the English game. His team, comfortable with the three-man defence he had used in Naples, had posed a threat through Nordin Amrabat and José Holebas down the flanks and, having gone close through Odion Ighalo, eventually led.\n\nAdlène Guedioura, outstanding in combination with Amrabat, swung over a cross that looped beyond Troy Deeney to reach Étienne Capoue, unmarked on the far side of the penalty area. The angle was unkind but the Frenchman, benefiting from Gary Cahill’s flicker of hesitation, collected and crunched a left-footed shot high into the top corner beyond Thibaut Courtois’s outstretched hand. It was Capoue’s second goal in successive games – he had scored only once in his previous 57 outings – though neither has yielded a win.\n\nThis team have now surrendered leads in their first two games of the campaign, though they will have been encouraged by confirmation of the signings of Younès Kaboul and, more eye-catchingly, Roberto Pereyra.\n\n“I’m not going to sleep very well, but we can hold our heads high,” Mazzarri said. “We played much better than we did at Southampton, where we’d played only 20 minutes like I’d wanted us to play. Today we managed 70.” That is progress. It is just not quite as marked as that of Chelsea under Conte.\n\nGareth Barry completes Everton revival with winning header against West Brom Read more\n\nShaun Maloney hands Hull second win in a row at Swansea Read more\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Étienne Capoue fires past Thibaut Courtois to put the hosts in front.

Not only had he claimed his first win as the Everton manager but, perhaps more significantly, he was able to confirm his leading striker Romelu Lukaku has decided to stay at Goodison Park.\n\nIt was a decisive intervention from Koeman that turned the course of this typically fiercely contested match with Tony Pulis’s West Brom. Having gone behind to an early Gareth McAuley goal, he brought Lukaku into the game 10 minutes before half-time. Everton were level before the break and rampant in a second half that was decided by Gareth Barry’s header and also featured a sparkling cameo from the debutant Yannick Bolasie.\n\n“I can confirm Romelu is staying with the club,” Koeman said. “He spoke to me yesterday morning and told me he had made the decision by himself to stay at least one more season at Everton. It’s great news for everyone and it’s possible he may sign a new contract.”\n\nPulis remained on his feet for the entirety of his post-match press conference and kept repeating the phrase “10 days”, the amount of time left in this transfer window for West Brom and their new Chinese owners to strengthen the squad.\n\nEverton started the game as they did against Spurs in a new 3-4-3 formation. The home side were quick to exploit any unfamiliarity. In the eighth minute Salomón Rondón forced Ramiro Funes Mori into a nervous backpass that went straight to the Venezuelan. Maarten Stekelenburg rushed out to smother the shot but at the expense of a corner. Craig Gardner swung the ball in, Saido Berahino blocked off the Dutch goalkeeper and the 36-year-old McAuley was at the back post to continue his Indian summer and power a header into the net.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Gareth McAuley climbs above several Everton defenders to open the scoring. Photograph: Jason Cairnduff/Reuters\n\nEverton responded by gaining control of possession, but failed to pose any attacking threat. Their biggest problem was making effective use of nominal No9, Gerard Deulofeu. The Spaniard had the speed to trouble McAuley and co but West Brom were sitting too deep for it to make a difference. And when tasked with finding a short through ball instead, Ross Barkley and Kevin Mirallas struggled.\n\nWith 10 minutes still to go to half-time, Koeman turned to Lukaku. The Belgian, subject of much summer transfer speculation, had yet to play in the Premier League this season. He came on here, replacing the wing-back James McCarthy, and immediately made an impact. Not only did he provide McAuley and Jonas Olsson with a worthy physical opponent, he allowed Everton to settle into a more comfortable 4-2-3-1 formation.\n\nChelsea’s Diego Costa pounces late to sink battling Watford Read more\n\n“It was a tactical change‚” Koeman confirmed. “We started with three at the back and if you go one nil down and they drop back even further, you really need a target man, you need to make the pitch wider. From that moment on we were the dominant team.”\n\nEverton were level by half-time through Mirallas. Picking up the ball in the inside-left channel, the Belgian drifted inside as if to shoot but instead passed to Barry. Barry’s first-time pass was matched by Barkley who found Mirallas again and his far-post shot was too powerful for Ben Foster to keep out. It was a cracking goal.\n\nEverton came out of the blocks in the second half, with Mirallas and the teenage full-back Mason Holgate causing havoc. Having robbed Olsson in possession and drawn a foul, Mirallas took a free-kick that was nearly converted by Funes Mori. Foster pushed the ball wide, but the corner that followed found Holgate unmarked at the back post. The teenager drilled his shot into the turf but the ball looped over the West Brom defenders and into the path of the onrushing Barry, who gobbled up the header at the near post.\n\nPulis attempted to get back into the game by replacing his wing men and adding Rickie Lambert up front. Lambert might have scored with his first touch but could not quite reach James McClean’s cross. Koeman meanwhile was able to grant Bolasie an Everton debut and the DR Congo international gave a sparkling sideshow, teeing up Lukaku for a one-on-one he should have buried to give the match a more

Just enough to avoid a two-game unwanted crisis. Just enough to save face. Just enough to suggest that, even if they are still rusty and looking a distance off the early-season intent shown by the big hitters from Manchester United, Manchester City, Chelsea (not forgetting Hull), they can still breathe.\n\nWith the consequences of defeat crystal clear, it was vital for both Leicester City and Arsenal to avoid the stress that would have provoked. As it was, even with a draw away from home to the defending champions, the visiting contingent provided a discordant accompaniment to a frenetic finale. “Spend some money,” yelled the fans in the away corner, with an expletive thrown in. It was almost rubbing it in to see Jamie Vardy, whom Wenger tried to buy, leave the field wearing a swapped Arsenal shirt.\n\nChelsea’s Diego Costa pounces late to sink battling Watford Read more\n\nAfter the match, the Frenchman made a passionate defence of the accusation he is reluctant to spend and promised he would spend astonishing amounts on the right player.\n\n“Why do you say I am reluctant? I don’t understand that,” said Wenger. “ If we find players who can strengthen our team we are not reluctant. I would spend £300m if I find the right player and I have £300m.”\n\nHe could not hide his disappointment to be thrown questions about finance and transfers in the immediate aftermath of an intense match with quite a lot on the line, even at this early stage of the campaign.\n\n“Unfortunately, nobody speaks about the performance of Rob Holding,” Wenger went on. “You should be happy – he is English, he is 20. But I am sorry he didn’t cost £55m so he cannot be good. He had an outstanding performance for a young boy who has never played in the Premier League up against a great player. We don’t talk about the players any more. We speak about anything else than football.”\n\nUnfortunately for Wenger, football, and perceptions about the extent that he strengthened his squad to prepare for this season, are linked. This was a point that was helpful for both teams under the circumstances, but both could also look ruefully at the fact they were unable to turn one point into three.\n\nDeep into stoppage time of a slow-burning game that ended with frantic chances at either end, Claudio Ranieri and Wenger urged their teams on intently. Oh for a win to reboot this season more convincingly. But it was not to be.\n\nThere were chances squandered and deflected, and for Leicester there was also the considerable question of whether they might have had a penalty or two.\n\nIn the first half, Danny Drinkwater felt Laurent Koscielny stretched and caught him as he raced on to a loose ball after the Arsenal keeper, Petr Cech, rushed out to smother at Vardy’s feet. Late in the second half, Ahmed Musa fell as Héctor Bellerín endeavoured to stop the speedy substitute on the run. On both occasions Mark Clattenburg waved away any appeals.\n\nNot many managers would have responded to a pair of close calls with the same generosity of spirit as Ranieri. But then not many managers are Ranieri-esque, full stop.\n\n“I am not a manager who cries: ‘Oh it was a penalty!’ For me it was OK. The referee made a good performance. For me a penalty is when the referee whistles.

They have suffered more in the last few years than they will probably wish to remember but José Mourinho could be seen saluting the crowd in triumph after this victory. Zlatan Ibrahimovic has two more goals for his personal collection while Paul Pogba, the world’s most expensive footballer, came out of his homecoming with a sunrise of a smile.\n\nPaul Pogba shows he can play big part in José Mourinho’s revitalisation project | Jamie Jackson Read more\n\nThe only disappointment, perhaps, was that Ibrahimovic could not mark his first appearance at his new ground by taking the matchball home as a souvenir of a hat-trick, and there was a moment after the game when he playfully chastised Pogba for shooting, rather than passing, during a late attack. That, however, was only a fleeting source of regret bearing in mind the buoyant mood inside the stadium and renewed sense of optimism.\n\nPogba showed, in flashes, why United have invested so much in shaping the team around him. Ibrahimovic has scored three times in his first two Premier League games and it says something for Mourinho’s rebuilding that Henrikh Mkhitaryan, another of the club’s summer recruits, was restricted to a late substitute’s appearance, with Michael Carrick, Phil Jones and Memphis Depay among those not even on the bench. Mourinho seemed genuinely pained when he spoke of the players who spent the night “in their nice Paul Smith suits rather than tracksuits”.\n\nMore than anything there was the sense of more to come. A new team are taking shape, featuring half a dozen six-footers, and Mourinho made the point there was still plenty of room for improvement. The partnership between Wayne Rooney and Ibrahimovic, for instance, can still be better even if they did combine for the Swede’s opening goal. Anthony Martial has started the season slowly and Pogba, as Mourinho explained, was not at the point of optimum fitness even if there were times when the £89m signing showed a mixture of speed, balance and control that had Old Trafford humming its approval.\n\nAfter an amusingly bad first touch Pogba looked as if he had been here years – which, in one sense, was absolutely the case – while Ibrahimovic supplied another clear reminder United have recruited a striker who is capable of outdoing some of the finest central defenders in England’s top division.\n\nManchester United 2-0 Southampton: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nWes Morgan can testify for Ibrahimovic’s upper body strength, competitive instincts and prodigious heading ability after the winning goal in the Community Shield and now it was José Fonte’s turn to feel the force. Ibrahimovic’s second goal was a penalty, early in the second half, but his first was another demonstration of his penalty-box menace. Rooney’s cross came from the right and Ibrahimovic, at 6ft 5in, was higher, stronger and more decisive in his leap than Fonte, directing an expertly angled header into the corner of Fraser Forster’s goal.\n\nUnited’s improvement is clear already, given they were facing a Southampton side who had won 1-0 on their last two visits to Old Trafford and aiming to become the only team other than Manchester City to win here three times in a row in the Premier League era.\n\nClaude Puel had started with an adventurous lineup, with Nathan Redmond and Shane Long in attack, and Dusan Tadic operating at the front of a midfield diamond. Their preparations were disrupted by an early injury to Oriol Romeu but they held their own early on and threatened sporadically throughout.\n\nAt other times they looked lightweight in attack while, for the home side, it was clear to see this was a Mourinho team rather than one operating to Louis van Gaal’s rigid tactics. United moved the ball with the kind of urgency that was not always apparent under their previous manager. Their full-backs were given more licence to go forward and it was from one of those attacks that Luke Shaw advanced into a position where Jordy Clasie, Romeu’s replacement, flicked out his foot to clip him for the penalty. Ibrahimovic took the ball – no arguments about who was United’s new penalty-taker – and rifled his shot to Forster’s right.\n\nGolden Goal: David Beckham for Manchester United against Wimbledon (1996) Read more\n\nShortly before, Tadic had turned a header past David de Gea only for the goal to be disallowed because one of the assistant referees had raised his flag. Puel did not complain too vociferously about either decision but Southampton had been entitled to be aggrieved about the penalty and, at 2-0, the home side could start to relax, playing with greater exuberance on the counterattack.\n\nMourinho had said Pogba would not last the entire match but the midfielder did stay on until the end. Marouane Fellaini has been rejuvenated so far under Mourinho and, continuing the theme of newfound unity, Juan Mata was warmly embraced by his manager when Mkhitaryan replaced him for the last quarter of an hour.\n\nIbrahimovic was offside when Antonio Valencia clipped a cross to him at the far post and Pogba drilled a late chance past the post. “You should have passed,” Ibrahimovic pointed out to his team-mate, with mock anger.

The 10th permanent managerial appointment of Roman Abramovich’s ownership ended this ferocious derby leaping in delight on the touchline, high-fiving the fans then burying himself in the front row of supporters in the east stand, as this arena erupted all around to celebrate the winner. After all last season’s traumas, the locals will ignore the inevitable controversy which accompanied success. One game in and already Conte is adored.\n\nAntonio Conte steps into the Chelsea spotlight but Mourinho shadow remains Read more\n\nIt was Diego Costa, inevitably, whose contribution had Slaven Bilic and his crestfallen West Ham players enraged. The Spain forward had already been booked for berating the referee, Anthony Taylor, following the first-half non-award of a penalty when, midway through the second period, he attempted to close down Adrián, slid in and planted his left foot into the inside of the goalkeeper’s right calf. The official took his time before determining no second caution would be flashed, let alone the red card for which plenty of the visitors were calling. There was an inevitability thereafter about where this dramatic occasion would veer.\n\nThe game had entered its final minute, West Ham comfortable in the parity earned by James Collins’s fine finish, when possession was lost wastefully, the substitute Michy Batshuayi flicked on a punt forward and Costa collected just outside the penalty area. Both Collins and Winston Reid hesitated, allowing the striker time to take aim with the low shot fizzing through the clutter of centre-halves and into the far corner of Adrián’s net. The visitors sank to their knees in deflation, Bilic infuriated on the sidelines. “The winning start was vital,” said John Terry. “That is the fight and the commitment we want. We dug in for a London derby. That is great for the management.”\n\nThey have missed evenings like this in these parts. Chelsea had beaten only five teams in the Premier League here last season, surrendering to as many visitors en route, to offer some context to Conte’s immediate impact even with virtually identical personnel. N’Golo Kanté for Cesc Fàbregas was his only alteration to the side, then champions, who had begun the opening game of the last campaign under José Mourinho.\n\nChelsea v West Ham United: Premier League – live! Read more\n\nYet Eden Hazard, who was to thump home the first goal of the Conte era from the penalty spot, was unrecognisable from the player who had taken over eight months to open his account last season. A “great talent” with a “fantastic attitude” was the Italian’s assessment. Just as significant was the fact that Costa, for all the trademark accompanying snarl, has his timing back.\n\nChelsea merited this success, even if it was squeezed out late and with the visitors, disrupted by the thigh injury which forced their debutant, André Ayew, from the fray, justifiably bemoaning the leniency of the officialdom. In truth, Bilic’s team had flattered to deceive during a bright opening quarter, the visitors lacking Dimitri Payet’s invention until the latter stages when that early urgency had long since been eclipsed and, eventually, overrun. Bilic was brutally honest in his post-match assessment. “Chelsea were much more aggressive, winning balls and second balls,” he said, “and their front four were on fire.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Diego Costa celebrates after scoring Chelsea’s winner against West Ham. Photograph: Justin Tallis/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOscar argued that his early penalty appeal was justified, for all that he appeared to dangle his leg to seek out contact from Reid’s challenge. Branislav Ivanovic was denied and Hazard curled just wide, before West Ham eventually self-destructed. Michail Antonio, still a makeshift full-back despite the occasional successes he enjoyed in defence last year, collected on the edge of the area early in the second half and attempted to dribble away from danger, merely presenting the ball to César Azpilicueta in the process. The challenge which followed inside the box was panicked and born of desperation. Hazard converted with Conte’s celebrations as manic as those in the stands. Antonio was swiftly withdrawn.\n\n“I liked the great intensity of my players,” said Conte. “We know we can improve through work but, today, it was very important to start with a victory. When a new manager arrives in a new club, he tries to bring with him his philosophy of football. We are working only one month together but tonight I saw the right intensity. It’s important to bring something different from last season.” This was a Chelsea side reminded of its underlying qualities.\n\nWest Ham’s Slaven Bilic ‘not happy’ Costa wasn’t sent off in Chelsea win Read more\n\nIt should have been more comfortable thereafter, the home side flooding forward with greater structure to their lineup and more fluency to their attacks, only for Adrián’s excellence to keep them at bay. But, while the lead was slender, the propensity to crack remained. Bilic was eventually forced to introduce Payet, the Frenchman’s fitness not quite up to scratch after his exertions at Euro 2016, and it was from his corner that West Ham equalised. Enner Valencia’s shot was blocked by Azpilicueta and Collins was quickest to react inside the box.\n\nFor 12 minutes thereafter Chelsea wondered if last year’s frailties might be exposed again.

Juan Mata and Ander Herrera offered flashes of incision and invention, Martial contributed from wide, while Ibrahimovic retains the strut that so terrified French club defences last season.\n\nHe was not always a presence in the penalty area, where he did not muster a touch before the break, but he has now scored on his bows in Serie A, La Liga, Ligue 1, the Champions League and Premier League. His scripts continue to be expertly written. “It is not easy,” the Swede said. “Everything is new for me, from my team-mates to the club, the environment, the new stadiums. But slowly I am getting settled in and I just play my game and make the team win.”\n\nThe influence he can have on this dressing room can be pivotal and, even if his combination with Wayne Rooney may instinctively appear awkward, they could each point to rewards here and even the odd glimpse of a proper partnership.\n\nYet, in keeping with true Mourinho pragmatism, this was only really about the result in an arena where United had succumbed under Louis van Gaal last season. The satisfaction was born of a rusty initial display eventually yielding a commanding win. Those early exchanges, where opportunities were spurned in overhit passes or scuffed attempts, appeared forgotten once a three-goal advantage was established. “To control the game without having problems makes this a good victory,” the manager said. He has never lost his first Premier League game of a season and, once his side were ahead, that sequence was never threatened by Bournemouth.\n\nEddie Howe could justifiably bemoan a lack of fortune in that opening concession, which served to puncture local optimism whipped up by 40 minutes of parity. Then, from nothing, Simon Francis’s back-pass was ill-judged, underhit and collected by a galloping Mata. His clipped shot was blocked by an on-rushing Artur Boruc, only for the ball to rebound off the stumbling Francis’s shins and back into the Spaniard’s path. He thumped the ball gleefully into the empty net.\n\nMata had never scored a Premier League goal for Mourinho having featured 13 times for him at Chelsea in 2013‑14. After the humiliation at Wembley last week, when the substitute was substituted in stoppage time apparently due to a lack of height in the side, this was a more satisfying intervention.\n\nPaul Pogba and Adnan Januzaj are two sides of the same coin | Daniel Taylor Read more\n\nThe goal did also perhaps illustrate why Howe is still seeking defensive recruits. The Stoke utility player Marc Wilson is expected to return to the south coast –where he had previously played for Portsmouth – in a deal worth an initial £2m this week, and Cook was almost exposed as Ibrahimovic’s flick sent Rooney bustling through before Boruc blocked smartly.\n\nThat proved to be a brief respite. Antonio Valencia was soon barging beyond Charlie Daniels to clip over a cross which was met by a wild attempt from Martial. True to the home side’s ill luck, the mis-hit bounced kindly for Rooney, alone on the edge of the six-yard box, who simply guided his header down and back across the Pole to double the lead.\n\nBournemouth, with Lewis Cook quietly impressive in central midfield, lacked the bite to wound the visitors, their forward players prone to over-elaborate in promising positions. Jordon Ibe, Joshua King and Callum Wilson may be more potent threats on the counter-attack away from home, but the substitutes Lewis Grabban and Benik Afobe at least ruffled United once Ibrahimovic had enjoyed his moment. It was Grabban’s pass which was collected by Adam Smith, the full-back thumping a fine consolation beyond David de Gea. The Spaniard had to save well from Andrew Surman, too, in stoppage time.\n\n“We were well in the game up to that first goal,” Howe said. “It was out of nothing: it wasn’t like they’d broken our shape and scored an outstanding goal. It was scrappy.” Mourinho will hardly care. There was a punch of the air at the end, apparently aimed towards, and returned by, Ed Woodward up in the stand. His tenure at United is up and running.\n\nMan of the match Eric Bailly (Manchester United)"}, {"date": "14/08/2016", "arena": "Emirates Stadium", "attendance": 60033, "home_team": {"name": "Arsenal", "lineup": [{"name": "Petr Cech", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Hector Bellerin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rob Holding", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Calum Chambers", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [75], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nacho Monreal", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Francis Coquelin", "yellows": [37], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mohamed Elneny", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [67]}, {"name": "Theo Walcott", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [31], "missed_pens": [30], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Ramsey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [61]}, {"name": "Alex Iwobi", "yellows": [57], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [59]}, {"name": "Alexis Sánchez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Kieran Gibbs", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Wilshere", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Ospina", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [64], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [59], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Santi Cazorla", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [61], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Granit Xhaka", "yellows": [86], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [67], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chuba Akpom", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Liverpool", "lineup": [{"name": "Simon Mignolet", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathaniel Clyne", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dejan Lovren", "yellows": [41], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ragnar Klavan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alberto Moreno", "yellows": [29], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Lallana", "yellows": [26], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [49], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [76]}, {"name": "Jordan Henderson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Georginio Wijnaldum", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [88]}, {"name": "Sadio Mané", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [63], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Roberto Firmino", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Philippe Coutinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [45, 56], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [70]}], "subs": [{"name": "Alex Manninger", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marko Grujic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Emre Can", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [70], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Divock Origi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [76], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joel Matip", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin Stewart", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [88], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Trent Alexander-Arnold", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Jürgen Klopp lost himself in the moment. The Liverpool manager beat his chest and, in the frenzy, he knocked his glasses from his face. Adam Lallana had just put his team 2-1 up early in the second half and, when the passions had cooled, Klopp fished around on the ground in order to reacquaint himself with his lenses.\n\nIt was an afternoon when Klopp and everybody else inside the Emirates Stadium could rub their eyes in disbelief. Liverpool were irresistible for a golden period after the interval, which climaxed in Sadio Mané, the £30m signing from Southampton, fizzing home their fourth goal. Klopp was central to the celebrations on the touchline, allowing Mané to clamber on to his back. He would later say that he regretted that. The game was not over, even if it felt like it was.\n\nLiverpool were vibrant and clinical, with their other expensive new boy, Gini Wijnaldum – the £23m purchase from Newcastle United – also prominent. Then, there was Philippe Coutinho who, not for the first time at this venue, was a joy to watch. He had equalised for 1-1 in first-half stoppage time with a scintillating 30-yard free-kick while he also scored his team’s third goal.\n\nArsenal 3-4 Liverpool: Premier League – as it happened! Read more\n\nIt was some game to open the season in north London but it was enjoyable only for Liverpool, where it feels that something is stirring. Klopp restored belief and unity last season and, after a full pre-season in which to hammer home his high-intensity methods and play the transfer market, he has talked of this as being his team. There were defensive glitches on display but the optimism could surge.\n\nFor Arsenal, there was bitter frustration and the same old questions, despite a gallant attempt to bounce back off the canvas after Mané’s goal for 4-1. The substitute Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain scored a fine solo goal and when Calum Chambers flicked home a header for 4-3, there could be thoughts of the crazy 4-4 draw between the teams at Anfield in 2009.\n\nAn Arsenal equaliser, however, never looked like materialising and, instead, there was the familiar sound of a chorus of boos from the home crowd at full-time. Arsène Wenger had been without seven players because of fitness issues and his makeshift central-defensive pairing of Chambers and Rob Holding, the new signing from Bolton Wanderers, was left exposed, although he did not blame them.\n\nArsenal started brightly and they were the better team in a first half during which Theo Walcott missed a penalty and then scored the opening goal. But it was shocking to see how sharply the tide turned and, yet again, there could be questions about the team’s mental fortitude.\n\nWenger lamented the timing of Coutinho’s equaliser while he also referenced the lack of experience in his team and how, physically, they had not been ready, which felt like an indictment. He can now count another couple of injuries, after Alex Iwobi and Aaron Ramsey were forced off with muscular problems around the hour and there will surely be renewed calls for Wenger to reinforce the squad with one or more signings.\n\nWenger had chosen to leave his one big-money purchase, Granit Xhaka, on the substitutes’ bench until the 67th minute while his decision to start Walcott ahead of Oxlade-Chamberlain on the right had been another surprise. Walcott showed his character to fashion the breakthrough, because the penalty miss had come moments earlier. From Iwobi’s pass, his instincts took over and the low finish flashed into the far corner.\n\nKlopp would complain about the penalty award, claiming Alberto Moreno played the ball rather than Walcott but it did not matter when Simon Mignolet went the right way to beat away the kick. Moreno’s challenge was clumsy, at the very least. It was the first penalty Walcott had taken in 10-and-a-half years as an Arsenal player.\n\nZlatan Ibrahimovic puts seal on Manchester United win at Bournemouth Read more\n\nLiverpool allowed Arsenal too much space in the first half and, apart from the 40th-minute counter, when Roberto Firmino and Coutinho worked a shooting opportunity for Wijnaldum, which Petr Cech kept out, they had not hinted at an equaliser. Coutinho’s execution was a “genius” moment, according to Klopp. Holding had conceded the free-kick when he nibbled into the back of Coutinho.\n\nRamsey had enjoyed a couple of early chances but Liverpool turned the game on its head after half-time. It felt as though they were holding an in-house competition for the goal of the month and there might have been another during that devastating spell only for Cech to save from Coutinho. Lallana could not convert the rebound.\n\nLallana scored with a crisp finish after Coutinho had released Wijnaldum; the third came when Coutinho touched in Nathaniel Clyne’s driven cross and Klopp was in raptures when the outstanding Mané sliced inside to send a rising drive into the far, top corner. Coutinho was forced off on 69 minutes but Klopp reported that it was merely because of cramp. Arsenal’s rally featured Oxlade-Chamberlain beating three men and embarrassing Mignolet at his near post and Chambers rising to glance home the substitute Santi Cazorla’s free-kick.

For Hull City’s caretaker manager and Leicester City’s star striker it must have felt as if the world had spun off its axis.\n\nThose moments seemed emblematic of a day when one of the most makeshift teams to have entered combat at this level defeated the English title-holders. Thanks to a finely struck winner from the excellent Robert Snodgrass, Leicester City became the first defending champions to lose the opening game of a season since the Premier League’s inception.\n\nHull City 2-1 Leicester City: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nWith Vardy off the pace and the City defence frequently all over the place Claudio Ranieri must have wondered if the chaos enveloping Hull had bred complacency among his players. Either that or last season really was an extraordinary, but strictly ephemeral, one off.\n\n“They were smarter than us,” the Leicester manager conceded. “We didn’t play like a team. We were 70%.”\n\nPhelan, who with a bench stocked with youth players, did not make a single substitution, was left almost nonplussed. “My emotions? Relieved, thrilled,” he said. “The players showed courage, stopped Leicester counterattacking. What’s happening has galvanised them.”\n\nHull’s ground staff arrived on Saturday morning to discover large swathes of the stadium scrawled with graffiti. “Allams out” was the (polite) gist and a major cleanup ensued.\n\nSoapy water and scrubbing brushes are useless when it comes to turning down the volume though. As kick-off approached an ugly “we want Allams out” soundtrack gained momentum. Most home fans came equipped with red cards which, before kick-off, were raised in protest at the shambolic stewardship of the only Premier League club not to have signed a single senior player this summer.\n\nWith Assem Allam, the chairman, seriously ill, his son, Ehab, is attempting to offload the club to Chinese investors and consortium members were in attendance. Just as they seemed in danger of taking fright and high-tailing it back to Beijing, Curtis Davies issued a beguiling glimpse of Hull’s potential by connecting with Snodgrass’s out-swinging corner and heading fractionally wide.\n\nConsidering Phelan – caretaking in the wake of Steve Bruce’s resignation last month – had only 13 fit senior players at his disposal Hull started strongly. Anyone dropping in from Mars or Jupiter would certainly never have guessed that Leicester were champions and their hosts newly promoted.\n\nInstead Ranieri’s team looked the nervy newcomers. Riyad Mahrez directed a routine pass into touch while Vardy’s outstretched boot sliced thin air as he strove to meet Ahmed Musa’s inviting ball. Gradually an ersatz home defence featuring Jake Livermore, a midfielder, at centre-half realised they might not need to retreat quite so deep after all. Bar a marginally off-target curler from Danny Drinkwater, Eldin Jakupovic, Phelan’s goalkeeper, was largely redundant.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Frustration for Jamie Vardy during the game. Photograph: Russell Cheyne/Reuters\n\nHad Mohamed Diamé, arguably’s Hull’s best player last season not been 150 miles up the road, preparing to make his Newcastle United debut, Sam Clucas would have been a substitute.\n\nYet handed an unfamiliar central midfield role he shone, making life unexpectedly difficult for Drinkwater and Andy King while leaving visiting fans pining for N’Golo Kanté.\n\nEven so Leicester might have scored after Musa, increasingly impressive, played a lovely one-two with Christian Fuchs who finally forced Jacupovic to divert a shot. Vardy shaped to pounce on the rebound but in zoomed Livermore with a brilliant block, leaving a furious Vardy hitting himself in the face and Mahrez firing the loose ball wide.\n\nIf the by now menacing Mahrez vexed Andy Robertson, Snodgrass persistently ruffled Danny Simpson and, appropriately enough, it was from his corner that Phelan’s team stunned everyone by assuming the lead as half-time beckoned.\n\nFrom that Snodgrass set-piece Davies forced Peter Schmeichel into a flying save and both Abel Hernández and Adama Diomandé flung themselves at the fallout. Although Hernández’s wonderfully acrobatic overhead kick appeared on target Diomandé applied the final touch. Talk about perfect synchronicity. “Quite unique,” Phelan said. “Two players scoring one goal!”\n\nIt left him in head-scratching mode but puzzlement soon turned to frusttation. When Tom Huddlestone felled Demarai Gray on the edge of the area Mike Dean awarded a penalty and Mahrez made no mistake from 12 yards.\n\nUndeterred, Snodgrass restored Hull’s lead courtesy of a first-time shot from 16 yards after Wes Morgan only half-cleared Ahmed Elmohamady’s vicious cross. It emphasised the vulnerability of a strangely shaky visiting defence. Robert Huth, aka ’The Berlin Wall’ cannot return soon enough.\n\n“The biggest fault is we weren’t together,” Ranieri said. “It’s important to fight as a team.”"}, {"date": "13/08/2016", "arena": "Turf

time since Boxing Day, there was a depressingly familiar air to an opening day Premier League defeat inflicted by Leroy Fer’s late winning goal.\n\nTottenham’s Érik Lamela rescues point against understrength Everton Read more\n\nBut for his Swansea counterpart, Francesco Guidolin, here was an encouraging sign of new times for his team, courtesy of a victory he believes they would have failed to record last season.\n\nFer struck eight minutes from time as he tapped in a rebound after Burnley’s goalkeeper, Tom Heaton, had done well to keep out a header from Swansea’s former Spain forward Fernando Llorente, the only new signing in either starting XI at Turf Moor.\n\nThe winner left Dyche, who was in charge when Burnley last had a solitary season in the top flight two years ago, bemoaning the football fates but, more specifically, sounding off about a failed penalty appeal and what he perceived to be gamesmanship by the visitors.\n\n“I don’t think we got much going for us last time in terms of decisions and there was a big one this time, with Michael Keane at the far post,” said Dyche. “We saw it. I don’t know how the linesman can’t see it.\n\n“It’s fair to say we try and get the lads not to fall over; we try and do things properly. But it’s fair to say there were a number of them [Swansea players] today who were interesting.\n\n“We try and play fair, we don’t want to be falling on the floor but then we don’t get anything. I’m not enjoying that side of it. I’ve spoken to the powers that be and asked if they’re going to be bringing in retrospective bans for diving – sorry, simulation, I’m not allowed to call it ‘diving’ – but they’re not interested.”\n\nThat penalty appeal, after Fer seemed to pull back Keane as he was about to pounce on a David Jones corner, looked solid while Dyche’s anger over Swansea’s willingness to go to ground was centred particularly on their swift winger Mo Barrow.\n\n“No, no,” said Guidolin. “Mo is very very quick and he is difficult for a defender. I think he is an honest player, a good guy. Maybe sometimes he is fouled against even more but he is an honest guy.”\n\nWhatever the rights and wrongs of Dyche’s claims – and it is hard not to side with the eminently sensible Burnley manager on most footballing matters – it was hard to argue against the justice of the result.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Scott Arfield clashes with Lukasz Fabianski after the Swansea keeper rushed out of his box. Photograph: Chris Vaughan - CameraSport/CameraSport via Getty Images\n\nWayne Routledge volleyed wide at the far post with the goal beckoning in the first half, Jordi Amat saw a goalbound shot cleared off the line just before the interval, Federico Fernández somehow volleyed over the crossbar from four yards at a corner and Llorente placed a header from a very promising position wide.\n\nStill, there was enough evidence for the Swansea manager to comment: “I’m happy with the win because I think last season we would have lost this game. I hope something for us has changed.”\n\nIn response, aside from a Dean Marney header and a Sam Vokes shot that was well held by Lukasz Fabianski, there was little to concern Guidolin until inury-time when the goalkeeper away Marney’s deflected shot.\n\nAs for Dyche, ever the realist, the Burnley manager is only too well aware that, with the winger Johann Gudmundsson his only new signing to date, reinforcements are imperative. The Anderlecht midfielder Steven Defour will undergo a medical on Monday while Brighton’s Dale Stephens remains a target.\n\n“We know we need more depth in the squad,” added Dyche. “We’ve done fantastically well with the numbers we’ve had but we need that depth, and quality, and we’re trying to do that.”"}, {"date": "13/08/2016", "arena": "Selhurst Park", "attendance": 24490, "home_team":

kicked, it was reassuring to see some things remain completely predictable. An impressive, if unaesthetic, defensive performance from West Bromwich Albion was rewarded by Salomón Rondón’s glancing header to leave Crystal Palace wondering if 2016 really will be their annus horribilis.\n\nTottenham’s Érik Lamela rescues point against under-strength Everton Read more\n\nHaving taken only 11 points in a diabolical second half of last season, this inauspicious start from Alan Pardew’s team will do those of a nervous disposition at Selhurst Park few favours. There is no need to get carried away at such an embryonic point but sufficient evidence exists that plenty of work must be done on the pitch and in the transfer market.\n\nYannick Bolasie is expected to complete his £28m move to Everton in the coming days, with Pardew saying: “If his heart is not with us we have to exchange goodbyes.” The manager is targeting a pair of strikers but could also reinforce other areas.\n\nPalace will also not meet such stodgy opponents each week. For all the murmurings of uncertainty following Guochuan Lai’s takeover of West Brom a little more than a week ago and Tony Pulis’s insistence his squad needs to be strengthened throughout, normal service appears to have immediately resumed. “We defended as a team very well,” Pulis said, “and we always looked dangerous. In the opening game, you never want to lose but if you can win it’s a great bonus.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest West Brom’s Salomón Rondón celebrates scoring against Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park. Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Reuters\n\nThat Saido Berahino looked tuned in and interested again was another notable fillip. Joining Rondón up front, the former England Under-21 striker worked hard but was short on sharpness. It looks increasingly likely that with a year remaining on his contract he will now remain at The Hawthorns. “We won’t let Saido go, the club will not let him go until someone comes in,” Pulis said. “We have to get him back to where he was in my first year here, when he was the main reason we survived. We lost him last year but if we can get him back, he and Rondón will be a handful for any team.”\n\nInitially Albion had shown plenty of attacking intent, most notably from a leaner and meaner Rondón, but they gradually dropped deeper as the half wore on. The Venezuelan had three good sights at goal before the break, the first met by a splendid Wayne Hennessey save following a Craig Gardner cross.\n\nAfter a tepid start, Palace finished an interminably dull opening period looking a tad more likely. Connor Wickham cast a lonely figure up top, doing little but reinforcing the need for additional options. Yet immediately behind him there were some flashes of excitement. Andros Townsend, making his competitive debut for the club, and Wilfried Zaha worked tirelessly either side of Lee Chung-yong, who was starting in place of Bolasie.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ben Foster saves from Wilfried Zaha to preserve West Brom’s lead. Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Reuters\n\nWhen the Congolese was introduced 25 minutes from the end, greeted by the afternoon’s loudest cheer, the game had already shown signs of opening up. Zaha was denied twice in the space of a few seconds by Ben Foster, while Jason Puncheon and Townsend also saw attempts blocked.

Everton were obliging opponents, slightly fortunate to take an early lead and positively delusional if they imagined they would be able to hang on to it for 85 minutes. In the end they were glad of a point, so small was their share of the game and so limited their attacking efforts, while Spurs will be satisfied with the result but acutely aware they could have done better.\n\nLeroy Fer strikes late as Swansea spoil Burnley’s top-flight return Read more\n\n“I was very disappointed with the first half. We started too slowly,” said Mauricio Pochettino. “We were much better in the second half. We looked more like the team of last season and we were close to winning by the end.”\n\nEverton paraded Ashley Williams on the pitch before kick-off, though the new signing from Swansea was deemed too short of match practice to make his debut in Ronald Koeman’s new-look back three. Mason Holgate, a member of that trio, was also one of three players making their first Everton start, the other two being the goalkeeper, Maarten Stekelenburg, and the defensive midfielder Idrissa Gana Gueye.\n\nThe change Everton found most difficult to get used to, however, was the absence of Romelu Lukaku as an outlet up front. The Belgian is widely believed to be on his way out of the club anyway but he needed stitches in a foot injury sustained during last week’s friendly against Espanyol and was not risked.\n\nThat meant the home side played without a recognised striker, with Gerard Deulofeu only a notional front runner, and, though Everton took the lead inside five minutes, it was significant that the goal came from a dead ball, Ross Barkley’s free-kick finding its way past Hugo Lloris without Phil Jagielka or Ramiro Funes Mori managing to get a touch to help it on.\n\nAlso significant was the fact Everton spent much of the rest of the first period on the back foot and in their own half. Without anyone to aim for in attack, and no one capable of holding possession in advanced positions, the home side found the ball kept coming back towards them. They defended well, with Gueye in particular winning applause for his neat interventions and efficient distribution, though Tottenham are not the sort of team one wants camped on the edge of one’s penalty area.\n\nMiddlesbrough denied win as Xherdan Shaqiri clinches point for Stoke City Read more\n\nThat said, Harry Kane was not being brought into the game regularly enough from a Spurs point of view and, when the striker took matters into his own hands and dumped Funes Mori on his backside with a meaty shoulder charge, he was rather harshly pulled up for a foul. All that Spurs actually managed by way of first-half attempts was a Christian Eriksen shot straight at Stekelenburg.\n\nJagielka forced a save from Lloris at the other end with a header from another free-kick before the goalkeeper pulled up with a hamstring strain. Tottenham were relieved that Michel Vorm was alert enough to deal with a Deulofeu chance right on the stroke of half-time when Danny Rose’s back pass fell short. The former Barcelona player was on to the ball in a flash and, though Vorm did well to close down his options, the finish lacked composure.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Hugo Lloris cannot stop Ross Barkley’s free-kick sailing into the corner. Photograph: Jason Cairnduff/Reuters\n\nPochettino decided a greater attacking threat was necessary in the second half and sent on Vincent Janssen to accompany Kane. With his first touch the £17m striker set up a shooting chance that Dele Alli fired too high but two minutes later Spurs were level. Janssen was not directly involved but Everton were more stretched when Kyle Walker swung over a cross from the right and Érik Lamela nipped in ahead of Holgate to place a header past Stekelenburg.\n\nEverton 1-1 Tottenham and more on Premier League opening day – live! Read more\n\nThe game was delicately poised in the final quarter. The home side lived dangerously by allowing Spurs to keep probing along the edge of their area and in the last 10 minutes the visitors were queueing up to take pot shots. In one hectic scramble a good save by Stekelenburg was needed to prevent a debut goal for Janssen from six yards. A late Lamela effort was deflected on to the bar by Holgate but somehow Everton held on. They will not have to play teams as relentlessly muscular as Spurs every week but they will have to resolve the Lukaku situation and cross the halfway line every now and again if the optimism engendered by Koeman’s arrival is to amount to anything.\n\n“Lukaku will be fit for next week,” the Everton manager promised. “I was happy enough with the performance as a whole but we had a big opportunity just before the interval that would have made it a different second half.”"}, {"date": "13/08/2016", "arena": "Riverside Stadium", "attendance": 32110, "home_team": {"name":

seven-year hiatus. Yet whereas Álvaro Negredo had raised the Riverside roof early on with a debut goal Boro were hanging on somewhat at the end of the game and a point ended up being a satisfactory start to their season.\n\nLeroy Fer strikes late as Swansea spoil Burnley’s top-flight return Read more\n\nStoke City were well off the pace in the opening half but Xherdan Shaqiri’s free-kick in the 67th minute ensured Mark Hughes’s side left Teesside with a point which, on reflection, will probably have satisfied both teams.\n\nAitor Karanka watched Middlesbrough play some sparkling football early on, with Gastón Ramírez particularly impressive, and there were plenty of encouraging signs for the Spaniard, with the exception of an injury to the new signing Marten de Roon. Negredo showed a predatory instinct to bundle in while Middlesbrough’s defence stood up to late pressure, something they may have to get used to on their return to the top flight.\n\nThe Riverside was reverberating with optimism before kick-off and that fractured period last spring was all but forgotten as a pristine pitch beckoned, while banners were unfurled and a plane flew overhead. This moment had been a long time in the waiting and Middlesbrough’s supporters were going to enjoy it.\n\nYet while spirits were high, there was an air of uncertainty about how Karanka’s team would stand up to the challenge of an established Premier League side full of international quality. Middlesbrough had four new players in the starting lineup but, if there was any apprehension beforehand about a transitional, gelling period, it was soon allayed.\n\nBoro came out of the blocks flying and were the superior side throughout a first half in which they scored one and hit the post twice. Ramírez was the standout performer but how Negredo will be thankful for a goal 11 minutes into his career on Teesside.\n\nAlbert Adomah was at the heart of an excellent team move, retrieving the ball in midfield and building momentum down the left, drifting a high cross to the back post where Ramírez rose to nod across goal. Negredo, who scored nine goals in 30 league appearances for Manchester City during the 2013-14 season, was in the right place at the right time and bundled the ball in with his shoulder.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Álvaro Negredo makes an early impact on his Premier League return, even if the goal was not the most graceful. Photograph: Steve Welsh/Getty Images\n\n“It’s important to score when you are a striker, especially for Álvaro,” said Karanka. “When we signed him I said he needed to recover his confidence. Maybe we should have won the game but we can’t forget that three months ago we were playing in the Championship. I’m more than pleased.”\n\nThe only serious blow for Middlesbrough came in the 18th minute, when their £12m summer signing from Atalanta, De Roon, was forced off with a hamstring injury, yet Adam Forshaw slotted into central midfield with ease.\n\nVictor Valdés, another debutant, was rarely called into action in the Middlesbrough goal and Karanka’s men could have been two up before half-time, Ramírez dropping his shoulder to beat Ryan Shawcross before hitting a left-footed shot on to the post; and he hit the woodwork again with a corner.\n\nHowever, the pattern of the game changed. Stoke began to control the ball and, although Middlesbrough were content to play on the break, their lead was soon eradicated.\n\nStoke had not crafted too many chances, other than a determined run from Marko Arnautovic that the Austrian sliced wide, but it was a piece of quality that brought them level.\n\nKaranka was furious that Stoke were awarded a free-kick on the edge of the Middlesbrough penalty area as the referee, Kevin Friend, had already played advantage, despite a trip by Adam Clayton. Shaqiri curled a precise effort in off Valdés's left-hand post, with the former Barcelona goalkeeper getting a faint touch.\n\nMark Hughes, the Stoke manager, said: “It was a great strike but it was the least we deserved. We looked strong and dynamic and it shows our pre-season preparation has gone well. It’s a big year for Shaq, I think he senses that.”"}, {"date": "13/08/2016", "arena": " Mary's Stadium", "attendance": 31488, "home_team": {"name": "Southampton", "lineup": [{"name": "Fraser Forster", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cédric Soares", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [80]}, {"name": "Maya Yoshida", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Virgil van Dijk", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matt Targett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Oriol Romeu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Davis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Ward-Prowse", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [55]}, {"name": "Dusan Tadic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shane Long", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [83]}, {"name": "Nathan Redmond", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [58], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Jordy Clasie", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "José Fonte", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jay Rodriguez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charlie Austin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [83], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex McCarthy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pierre-Emile Højbjerg", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [55], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jérémy Pied", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [80], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Watford", "lineup": [{"name": "Heurelho Gomes", "yellows": [87], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Craig Cathcart", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sebastian Prödl", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Miguel Britos", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nordin Amrabat", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Etienne Capoue", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [9], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Valon Behrami", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [64]}, {"name": "Adlene Guedioura", "yellows": [60], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [73]}, {"name": "José Holebas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Troy Deeney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Odion Ighalo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [81]}], "subs": [{"name": "Allan Nyom", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Juan Camilo Zuniga", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [73], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jerome Sinclair", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matej Vydra", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ikechi Anya", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [81], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Watson", "yellows": [], "reds": [76], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [64], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Costel Pantilimon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "With their mutual glowing tans and salt and pepper hair, Claude Puel and Walter Mazzarri could be mistaken for each other. The Frenchman and the Italian also shared the distinction of marking their managerial debuts in the Premier League by sharing the points in a seesawing draw that gave both some cause for optimism.\n\nMazzarri will look back at a first half that his Watford team dominated, their physical capabilities matched by a keen understanding of the game plan that gave them a one-goal lead that could have been more. The new Saints manager took consolation from an improved second-half showing in which his charges added determination to a decent passing game that bore fruit with Nathan Redmond’s equaliser.\n\n“I feel disappointment because this afternoon we lost two points,” Puel said. “We had a good second half with many situations. The first half was no good, we didn’t play, not with the kind of qualities I want from my players. But I liked our reaction in the second half. We saw our players take responsibility and this is interesting for the future.”\n\nDespite Puel’s words, Mazzarri seemed the more contented manager after the final whistle and insisted that when his team are fully match fit draws like this will become wins. “When we were at 100% of energy we played like I want my teams to play,” he said. “Many times in the first half we got into the box and we missed important chances. Even in the second half we had two or three chances to score.”\n\nWatford opened the scoring in the ninth minute when Nordin Amrabat’s deep cross found Troy Deeney, unbeatable in the air all day. The Watford captain did what comes naturally and delivered a perfect knockdown to the penalty spot, where Étienne Capoue lumbered on to the ball and hammered it into the roof of the net. It was the Frenchman’s first goal in 37 games and Mazzarri complimented him on a “very good performance”.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Etienne Capoue fires Watford into an early lead. Photograph: Hannah McKay/Reuters\n\nFor a 20-minute period after the goal, it was a decided mismatch. Saints could not handle Watford’s physicality and, in their desperation to avoid being robbed of the ball, rushed their passing game. The £11m signing Nathan Redmond looked like a lost boy in a land of giants, while Dusan Tadic flitted in and out of the game. A brief passage after the half-hour mark saw Southampton do slightly better in possession, but when Steven Davis finally managed to break through Watford’s sturdy central defensive three, his cute cutback found not one of his team-mates in or around the six-yard box.\n\nSouthampton came out reinvigorated after half time and soon equalised, with the help of the eminently flappable Heurelho Gomes. A counterattack had finally given Redmond an opportunity to run into space and his curling shot was excellently tipped past the post by the Brazilian keeper. The corner that followed should have resulted in a goal as Gomes opted to punch once more, spilling the ball to Redmond whose shot was deflected for another corner. Einstein’s definition of insanity then played itself out as Gomes opted to punch once again, flapped once again and this time Redmond made no mistake, volleying home from 15 yards.\n\nThe game then settled into a stalemate until everything was thrown up in the air in the 75th minute. With Watford momentarily holding a high line, a quick through ball saw Shane Long bearing down on goal in a sprint with Ben Watson. The Watford player, who had entered the field only 10 minutes before, looked favourite to win the race, but a moment’s hesitation allowed Long to put his body between the midfielder and the ball. A tug on the shirt followed, Long went down and Watson marched off.\n\nSaints looked to apply late pressure against 10 men but an apparent winner from Redmond was ruled out as the new man strayed

Guardiola, with his reputation for bewitching football and a masterplan based on worldwide domination, it is probably fair to say Manchester City may have expected more from his first game. They won, courtesy of an 87th-minute own goal, but the revolution is clearly going to need time and it was difficult not to pity David Moyes and his Sunderland players given how close they came to turning Guardiola’s grand entrance into an ordeal. “I realise now how difficult it is,” was the verdict from the former Barcelona and Bayern Munich manager.\n\nGuardiola’s body language on the touchline certainly did not offer the impression of a man who liked what he saw and there was a considerable element of fortune about the game’s decisive moment when Paddy McNair, one of the Sunderland substitutes, turned a right-wing cross into his own net. McNair had been on the pitch only four minutes and, having just signed from Manchester United, the Northern Ireland international will have to hope the rest of his Sunderland career is a less harrowing experience.\n\nHis new team-mates can be desperately disappointed bearing in mind the way they refused to capitulate following Sergio Agüero’s early penalty, culminating in Jermain Defoe turning in a 71st-minute equaliser to move to joint 10th on the list of all-time Premier League scorers.\n\nPep Guardiola says Joe Hart must fight his way back after being dropped Read more\n\nDefoe has 144 top-division goals and, with a touch more ambition, Sunderland might actually have put more pressure on Willy Caballero, City’s occasionally accident-prone goalkeeper, on a traumatic day for Joe Hart that saw him relegated to the bench. All summer there have been rumours Guardiola has misgivings about the England international. His team selection provided the hard evidence and there have to be doubts now about whether Hart will remain at the club.\n\nYaya Touré could also be forgiven if he were filled with insecurity, considering he did not even merit a place among Guardiola’s substitutes and there were times when the club’s supporters must have felt slightly dizzy trying to keep up with all the changes. Guardiola had tweaked City’s tactics in a number of ways and, having started with a 4-1-4-1 formation, it was fascinating to see the switch to 3-2-4-1 when they were attacking.\n\nThose were moments during the match when Fernandinho dropped back from midfield to play in between John Stones and Aleksandar Kolarov as an additional centre-half. Bacary Sagna and Gaël Clichy, full-backs by trade, moved inside to become converted midfielders and the other five outfield players pressed forward. No other side in English football plays this way.\n\nIt is plainly a work in progress and Guardiola will have to hope his players are intelligent enough to understand what he wants because, if so, it feels as if a slick, sophisticated operation is being put in place. This, however, was not the day it gelled, or even close.\n\nSunderland have not won any of their opening Premier League fixtures since 2009 but the visiting players also had a new manager to impress and they knocked the ball around confidently at times. It also felt like a good time to encounter City when the home side had a new-look defence, a different set of tactics to negotiate and a goalkeeper trying to justify his selection and prove he can be trusted.\n\nThe harsh reality for Guardiola is that Hart and Caballero are both error-prone and, having preferred the Argentinian, there were a couple of anxious moments in the first half when the goalkeeper’s misplaced kicks threatened his own team. Caballero, to give him his due, also kept out Defoe with a smart reflex save but the most effective goalkeepers have a presence that inspires confidence and he has rarely shown that during his time in Manchester.\n\nOn a brighter note for City there were encouraging signs Raheem Sterling has reacted positively to Guardiola’s arrival. Sterling was operating in a new role on the right and it was his run that led to Patrick van Aanholt conceding the penalty after only three minutes. Sterling had cut inside Van Aanholt and the full-back’s sliding challenge, at full speed, was mistimed and risky. Agüero aimed his shot low and hard to Vito Mannone’s right and, though the goalkeeper dived the correct way, he was beaten by the accuracy and power.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola celebrates his team’s late winner. Photograph: Lee Smith/Reuters\n\nFor the remainder of the match, the surprising part was how slow everything seemed. Stones had an accomplished display but Nolito rarely threatened on the left wing and Kevin De Bruyne was strangely subdued. Sunderland had Donald Love making his debut at right-back. Lamine Koné excelled at centre-back despite all the hullaballoo about his future and Moyes had Lynden Gooch, on loan at Doncaster Rovers last season, in midfield. Yet the team who finished fourth from bottom last season held their own and it was rare to see City, with David Silva captaining the team, creating so few chances on their own ground.\n\nDefoe’s goal was a typically astute piece of centre-forward play, running on to Jack Rodwell’s through ball before slipping his shot beneath Caballero, and Sunderland did not deserve the misfortune that turned the match back in favour of the home side. Jesús Navas, a 59th-minute replacement for Nolito, drilled in the cross and the ball flicked off Mannone, struck McNair and ricocheted into the net. Guardiola had his first win, just not in the style that might have been expected."}]
