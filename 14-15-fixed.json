He was giving nothing away. “I cannot tell you what I will do next weekend,” Wenger said.\n\nIf it sounded like Wenger was responding with a poker face to questions about his plans for the FA Cup final on Saturday, perhaps his answer invited deeper analysis. This 4-1 demolition of West Brom has given Wenger a couple of intriguing selection headaches for Wembley and the honest truth could be that Theo Walcott’s 33-minute hat-trick and Wilshere’s all-round excellence means that Arsenal’s lineup against Aston Villa will not be as easy to predict as it might have been a week ago.\n\nMost prominent in Wenger’s thoughts will be whether Walcott or Olivier Giroud should be the focal point of Arsenal’s attack against Villa. That would not have been a debate two months ago, when Giroud was scoring so freely and Walcott was being criticised after suffering as a No10 in England’s friendly against Italy. However, the goals have dried up for Giroud in the past month and Walcott, granted a rare start in the middle, was outstanding.\n\nWhereas Giroud is a target man whose game is based on hold-up play and intelligence in the area, Walcott is always on the shoulder of the last defender and West Brom could not handle his speed or movement. He could have had six goals on another day.\n\nLike Walcott, Wilshere has struggled to play consistently because of injuries. He was exceptional on the right of Arsenal’s attack and Wenger will agonise over whether Wilshere should start instead of Aaron Ramsey at Wembley. Ramsey came on in the second half and almost scored three times, the overworked Boaz Myhill tipping one of his efforts on to the bar.\n\nVictory for Arsenal sealed third place and ensured that they will not have to go through a play-off to qualify for the Champions League in August. West Brom were blown away by the speed, quality and relentlessness of Arsenal’s attacks and one breathtaking dummy from Wilshere, who swerved away from Claudio Yacob, captured the gulf in class between the sides.\n\nAdmittedly West Brom were obliging opponents and Tony Pulis shouldered the blame for not freshening his side up after last Monday’s 3-0 victory over Chelsea. At least Pulis could reflect on the respectability of finishing 13th.\n\nWalcott began the rout in the fourth minute. Santi Cazorla threaded a pass through to him and he made light of a tight angle by thumping a stinging shot into the top-right corner from the right of the West Brom area.\n\nArsenal doubled their lead in the 14th minute. Although a one-two between Wilshere and Mesut Özil did not quite come off, the ball broke to Walcott after a tame tackle from Gareth McAuley and he danced past Jonas Olsson before stabbing a low shot past Myhill.\n\nArsenal were rampant and when Gabriel Paulista set up Wilshere three minutes later, his left-footed shot from 20 yards was past Myhill in flash.\n\nWilshere was also the brains behind the goal that sealed Walcott’s hat-trick. There was a one-two with Alexis Sánchez, followed by a cute dink to Cazorla, whose wayward shot was tapped in at the far post by Walcott.\n\nAnother boost for Arsenal was a late cameo from Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, who has been out for the past two months with a groin injury, with the only disappointment being their failure to keep a clean sheet.\n\nDavid Ospina, a capable goalkeeper but not entirely convincing as Arsenal’s No1, got nowhere near Chris Brunt’s corner and McAuley headed in a consolation goal for West Brom after 57 minutes.\n\nOspina later flapped a shot from Craig Gardner on to the bar. There is always room for improvement.\n\nMan of the match Theo Walcott (Arsenal)"}, {"date": "24/05/2015", "arena": "Villa Park", "attendance": 40792, "home_team": {"name": "Aston Villa", "lineup":

Villa supporters are trusting this was a case of before the Lord Mayor’s show as they warmed up for Saturday’s FA Cup final with a distinctly below-par performance on a day when Burnley signed off from the Premier League with a typically spirited display and a rare away win.\n\nFittingly, it was Danny Ings who scored the only goal of the game, his 11th in the league this season, and he went over to the Burnley fans to offer a muted wave of farewell after the final whistle blew with his future likely to be away from Turf Moor. “It looks that way,” Sean Dyche, the Burnley manager, said.\n\nIt has been a hearty effort from Burnley, and they gave their all at Villa Park, as they have all season long, even if that has not proved sufficient to avoid an immediate return to the Championship.\n\nVilla secured their Premier League status last week, after this spring’s fine resurgence under Tim Sherwood that they hope has one more peak at Wembley, but they finish one place above the relegation zone after ending the campaign with successive defeats. “The table tells no lies,” the downcast Villa manager said. “Where you finish in the league is where you deserve to finish.” Now they must rediscover their previous level of intensity if they are to give Arsenal a game on Saturday.\n\nIt is to Burnley’s credit that, although they have the Championship rather than the Cup final to look forward to, they were more up for the challenge on the day. Once ahead, they also had the knowledge that t is more than three months since they scored and lost. “Credit to Burnley,” Sherwood said. “They were difficult to break down. They scored early and we didn’t show enough imagination to break them down. Everyone came here today and expected us to turn Burnley over. They ain’t done that too many times over the last couple of years.”\n\nIngs’s winner at Hull a fortnight ago was the only goal Burnley had scored in their previous eight games so when he headed neatly home in the sixth minute, after Ashley Barnes nodded back into the danger area following Frederik Ulvestad’s heading duel, the travelling supporters celebrated wildly. Ings should have scored again 20 minutes later but leant back before sidefooting a half-volley way over the crossbar. “I was on to him for not getting the second,” Dyche said. “I don’t think he’s thirsty to go anywhere, he just wants a fresh and a bigger challenge. We all want to be in the Premier League.”\n\nIt was not that Villa played badly, just that their concentration seemed slightly awry. The 6-1 thrashing at Southampton last week had indicated minds were turning to Wembley but, apart from Jed Steer being granted his Premier League debut with Shay Given injured, Sherwood named his strongest available lineup. The Villa manager reported that Given was a doubt for the Cup final, having sustained a groin injury in training. “They’re assessing him,” he said. “I’m not ruling him out.”\n\nSteer played creditably well, denying George Boyd midway through the second half with a rapid rush from his goal while, at the other end, Tom Heaton showed why he has been called up by England with a man-of-the-match contribution. He shovelled a Christian Benteke header round the post and tipped an Ashley Westwood volley over the crossbar at the end of the first half then, as Villa dominated the second period, produced increasingly impressive saves from Gabriel Agbonlahor, Fabian Delph and Charles N’Zogbia.\n\nMan of the match Tom Heaton (Burnley)"}, {"date": "24/05/2015", "arena": "Stamford Bridge", "attendance":

to spring at his back, finally hoisted the Premier League trophy. The title had already been theirs for three weeks, although Chelsea’s superiority over allcomers had actually been established during that searing start last autumn and was only fleetingly challenged by Manchester City at the turn of the year. Chelsea have been top for 274 days, the only club of the 92 to remain unbeaten at home. Theirs has been a campaign of utter dominance.\n\nThe achievement was rightly celebrated with gusto; players and staff parading with their families amid the ticker-tape as Madness blared out over the public address system and those from the Shed End to the Matthew Harding stand bounced in glee. José Mourinho flung his winner’s medal to his daughter, Matilde, and offered eight fingers to the cameras, the tally of league titles he has secured at four clubs and as many countries. Drogba, crowned by the lid of the trophy, took the microphone and made a point of mentioning the absent Frank Lampard, a scorer for Manchester City on his final appearance in English football at the distant Etihad.\n\nPerhaps all the pomp and circumstance would have been more suited for the immediate aftermath of that victory over Crystal Palace on 3 May, when the title was sealed. At least the joyous delirium gave Drogba and, most likely, Petr Cech fitting sendoffs after glittering careers in these parts. The Ivorian, as befits a player of his charisma, managed to hog the limelight in a last-day win of which he played barely 28 minutes. Chelsea’s captain for the day had been retired from the fray just after Sunderland had taken the lead, the home players propping him on their shoulders – Branislav Ivanovic, Mikel John Obi and Juan Cuadrado took the brunt – and chairlifting him from the field.\n\nIt took two minutes for Drogba to depart, the entire coaching staff and the sporting director, Michael Emenalo, waiting on the touchline to clap hands with the striker. The theatre had been pre-arranged, and cleared with Sunderland’s Dick Advocaat before kick-off. It gave the occasion the feel of a testimonial, although some players warrant such adulation.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Didier Drogba is carried off by his team-mates as he is substituted. Photograph: Tom Jenkins for the Guardian\n\n“He was part of the ‘other’ team,” said Mourinho, a reference to the 2005 Premier League title winners, eight of whose number had joined Cech, Drogba and John Terry on the pitch before kick-off to mark that achievement a decade on. “But he also belongs to this new Chelsea. For these players to know him, train with him, live with him, play with him, share with him is fantastic. He was very, very good for these young people. They learned from a good example.”\n\nHis replacement, Diego Costa, duly hauled the hosts level by scoring his 20th league goal of an impressive first campaign in English football from the penalty spot after John O’Shea tripped Cuadrado. Another substitute, Loïc Rémy, scored twice after the interval to ensure the third highest points tally in this club’s history, even if it was Drogba, returning to the pitch post-match, who claimed the match ball as his own. No one was denying him that.\n\nFor Cech, an awkward decision awaits. He may already have determined that the time is right to move on, 11 years since he arrived in south-west London, after a frustrating season largely spent playing understudy to Thibaut Courtois. The crowd made clear their desire for him to stay, rejoicing in his denials of Sebastian Larsson, Connor Wickham and Jermain Defoe, even if Steven Fletcher had been able to nod the visitors ahead, having been untracked at a corner beyond the far post.\n\n“He’s a legend of this club but he’s a legend at 33,” Mourinho said of Cech. “And 33 for a goalkeeper is a very young legend. I’m not sure, if Petr was not here to make decisive saves in the seven [league] matches he played, if we could be champions, so his contribution was decisive.” He set Cech’s current team-mates the challenge to secure trophies such as this “on a regular basis”. “This team is just at the beginning,” he added. “It won the Capital One Cup and the Premier League. They have to win more to be better than the side of 2005.”\n\nSunderland, too, have issues to address. Advocaat’s achievement in staving off relegation was impressive and there is a clamour for him to stay on and instigate the overhaul of the playing staff the Dutchman admitted was necessary. “It’s not up to me because they offered me already two or three years,” he said. “But I have to be honest to myself and to everybody what I will do for the future.”\n\nHe will make a decision, in conversation with the sporting director, Lee Congerton, this week at about the same time as Chelsea depart for Thailand and Australia for a post-season tour.

Harry Kane was instrumental in elevating Tottenham Hotspur above Liverpool and straight into the group stage of the Europa League while Everton embarked on a sheepish “lap of appreciation” after the final whistle following one more meek display. It left both managers raising their sights for next season; Mauricio Pochettino out of sheer ambition, Roberto Martínez out of necessity.\n\nKane settled the contest with a precise first-half header to join Jürgen Klinsmann, Teddy Sheringham and Gareth Bale as Tottenham’s record goalscorer in a Premier League season with 21 goals. He provided a threat Everton were unable to match and a finale in keeping with an outstanding individual campaign. For good measure, the 21-year-old also removed the complications from Pochettino’s summer by securing automatic entry into the Europa League, when an earlier qualification round had beckoned before kick-off.\n\n“It’s very important that we are straight to the groups,” said the Spurs manager. “It means that for next season we have more time to prepare and this is very important. Finishing above Liverpool, Southampton and Everton is also a very big thing for us. Now our aim for next season is to improve the squad and to aim for the top four from the very start of the season. It will be difficult but you have to be ambitious. It was an unbelievable season, in the end we achieved, and next season we can be better.”\n\nThere was little at stake other than a fifth-place finish for Spurs but that was sufficient to inspire a one-sided first half. They dominated until Everton roused themselves shortly before the interval, when Hugo Lloris saved well from Seamus Coleman and Kevin Mirallas clipped an angled shot on to the roof of the net.\n\nSpurs showed strength, composure and technique in midfield but the hosts were found wanting on each count as Ryan Mason, Érik Lamela and co were afforded the space to dictate. Only when Martínez withdrew Ross Barkley after an error-strewn 45 minutes and introduced Muhamed Besic into a three-man central midfield did Everton find the aggression and urgency their performance required.\n\n“We wanted to finish the season on a high in front of our own fans but it wasn’t to be,” said the Everton manager, who confirmed Barkley’s substitution was for tactical reasons. “We lost the game in the first half. It was a really disappointing 45 minutes, we played in a loose manner and allowed them possession too easily. It was much better in the second half but we lost the game before half-time.”\n\nChristian Eriksen, Mason and Lamela all had early chances, with Tim Howard saving well from the Argentinian after Brendan Galloway had lost possession. The England Under-21 defender was making his first start at Goodison following his full debut at West Ham United and despite that almost costly slip, he produced a prominent, assured outing from left-back. “Young players normally play at the level of the team but he was above it and that spoke volumes,” said Martínez, who later replaced Galloway with Sylvain Distin to give the veteran the send-off his fine Goodison career deserved.\n\nThe Everton goal was under pressure throughout the first half and there was little Howard could do to prevent Spurs taking a merited lead. Again, they were allowed to exchange passes around the Everton penalty area unchallenged. The ball was switched out wide to Eric Dier on the right and from his inviting first-time cross Kane of all people was left unmarked at the near post and steered a header beyond Howard into the far corner. As well as equalling a Premier League scoring record for his club, the goal was Kane’s 37th of the season in total for Spurs, England and England Under-21s.\n\nPochettino added: “It is a fantastic season for Harry. I’m happy that Harry has equalled the record because it’s an important thing for the club but I’m happy for the other youngsters too. Nabil Bentaleb, Ryan Mason, Eric Dier – they are very, very young and they deserve all of the praise. I’m very pleased for them, our group is very young and I’m very happy with our season.”\n\nMan of the match Harry Kane (Tottenham Hotspur)"}, {"date": "24/05/2015", "arena": "KCOM Stadium", "attendance": 24745, "home_team": {"name": "Hull City", "lineup": [{"name": "Steve Harper", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Chester", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [70]}, {"name": "Michael Dawson", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paul McShane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ahmed Elmohamady", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Meyler", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [86]}, {"name": "Tom Huddlestone", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stephen Quinn", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robbie Brady", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dame N'Doye", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [71]}, {"name": "Nikica Jelavic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Allan McGregor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Liam Rosenior", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex Bruce", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Abel Hernandez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [70], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yannick Sagbo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sone Aluko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [71], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andrew Robertson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [86], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Manchester United", "lineup": [{"name": "Victor Valdes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Antonio Valencia", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Smalling", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Jones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marcos Rojo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daley Blind", "yellows": [57], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Juan Mata", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [73]}, {"name": "Ander Herrera", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Young", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [59]}, {"name": "Ángel di María", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [23]}, {"name": "Wayne Rooney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Adnan Januzaj", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [23], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Anders Lindegaard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robin van Persie", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marouane Fellaini", "yellows": [], "reds": [77], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [59], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paddy McNair", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tyler Blackett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Wilson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [73], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "For Hull City this was a fond, meek, slightly disbelieving farewell. Steve Bruce’s game but toothless Tigers claimed the final relegation spot, an energetic 0-0 draw with Manchester United insufficient to lift them out of the bottom three. With Newcastle winning 2-0 at home this was always not one but two steps too far for the home team, who entered the final day knowing a win would be irrelevant without the dual defibrillation of victory for a demob-happy West Ham at St James’ Park.\n\nInstead, for the fans at least, this was a restrained but still mildly defiant farewell to the Premier League, marred by some sourness near the end after a reckless challenge by Marouane Fellaini on Paul McShane that earned him a straight red card.\n\nOverall Hull played with enough energy and invention to suggest things might have ended differently had they showed the same qualities more often over the past six months. Or indeed in the past few weeks given that Hull have not so much sunk towards relegation as crept in by stealth, entering the bottom three in May as Leicester went the other way.\n\nIf there has been a lack of razor edge, or of any real drive in midfield, questions must surely be asked of Bruce’s transfer dealings. Something close to £40m has been spent, mainly on a collection of generic Premier League old hands and familiar faces. Hull have been unlucky with injuries: with Nikica Jelavic and Robert Snodgrass fit things might have been different. But not, you sense, all that different.\n\nAs Hull’s players trooped off in watery sunshine there was a slight sense of numbness from the home support. These have been curious times generally, with hostilities with the owner Hasem Allam in a state of wary ceasefire, and no more than a slight sense of bafflement at the way £60m invested over two years has produced such an uninspiring team. Bruce has a new contract to marshal his team in the Championship.\n\nAnd Hull have a manageable wage bill staffed with players who could perform well at the lower level, without being so good they are likely to be lured away in a hurry. But these are still wary times for a club that is for all its ambition – and relegation is undoubtedly a blow to the global marketing plan – a minor power, reliant on soft loans from its quixotic tycoon owner\n\nFrom the start on a breezy, balmy day the stadium was not so much a cauldron of noise as a cauldron of polite, resigned expectancy. For United Wayne Rooney, the hammer of Hull in recent years, returned to the starting XI. David de Gea was missing and may yet have said his final goodbye depending on how a summer of epic-scale transfer wrangles shapes up. Radamel Falcao was also a no-show on the final day. So, no real change there then.\n\nAs United settled into another bespoke Van Gaal styling, this time a 4-1-3-1-1, with Daley Blind in the anchor role and Angel Di María just behind Rooney, Hull found some space on the flanks. Twice Ahmed Elmohamady scampered in behind Marcos Rojo, the second time his cross-shot on the run bounced wide.\n\nMidway through the half Hull even had the ball in the net twice in two minutes. First Victor Valdés was judged to have been fouled as he leapt for the ball and spilled it in front of McShane. Then Stephen Quinn’s low shot from the left crossed the line, but with two offside players obstructing the goalkeeper. The KC was, briefly, in uproar. On the touchline Bruce patrolled his rectangle with shoulders slumped. Still: no news from Newcastle was good news.\n\nWith Arsenal beating West Bromwich Albion – wringing the last drop of life from United’s season in the process – the game settled into a nervous kind of stasis, a team sleepwalking towards relegation against another simply sleepwalking. For United Adnan Januzaj came on for the injured Di María and showed some twinkly touches.\n\nAnd there were some nice passing triangles from Rooney, Juan Mata and Ander Herrera, albeit with the air of a slightly sleepy cat toying with a doomed mouse.\n\nFor Hull Robbie Brady looked lively on the left, twice delivering deep, drilled crosses that tested Valdés’s handling in welcome-to-England style. On his full debut, United’s goalkeeper looked happy enough taking the ball. But then, he does have three Champions League winner’s medals to his name.\n\nHalf-time shuffled into view with no goals here, but no goals 99 miles to the north either. And Hull pressed again at the start of the second period, David Meyler shooting over from 10 yards on the half volley. At which point, with 54 minutes on the clock the news came through that Newcastle had scored and instantly the life drained out of the occasion, with Hull’s support divided into stony silence and pockets of defiant encouragement. Still, to their credit, the players kept going and with the clock ticking down Jelavic drew another fine reaction save from Valdés following Sone Aluko’s pull-back.\n\nHull’s fans were a lesson to their team, cheering until the end and applauding the players off down the tunnel and into the Championship. For United there were cheers from the away support, too, at the end of a season that, for all its occasionally fraught moments, sees Louis van Gaal’s team heading back into the Champions League."},

be aiming higher than just surviving again in the Barclays Premier League next season. His team thumped QPR 5-1 at home on the final day of the season to complete an amazing recovery by taking 22 points from the last 27 on offer and secure a 14th-placed finish.\n\nHowever, Pearson says he does not want the club to be involved in a similar relegation battle next season. “Let’s keep the celebrations in context,” Pearson said after his side had completed a seventh win in nine league games with their biggest victory of the season. “It’s a fabulous achievement but I wouldn’t want to be looking at avoiding relegation as a target to aspire to.\n\n“The two clubs [QPR and Burnley] who come up with us have been relegated, so it’s clearly a difficult transition to make. I’m a big believer in setting targets which are going to stretch people but I have also got a sense of realism about them.\n\n“Finishing 14th wouldn’t have been believable a couple of months ago but we’ll see how we add to squad and progress next year.”\n\nPearson was delighted with a performance in which five players, Jamie Vardy, Marc Albrighton, Leonardo Ulloa, Esteban Cambiasso and Andrej Kramaric, all found themselves on the scoresheet.\n\n“Having assured our status last week there was an element of whether we could rise to the occasion,” Pearson said. “I wouldn’t say the intensity was there but we played with a ruthless edge and it was important to finish on a good note.\n\n“We’ve proved in the last nine games that we are capable of being very effective and getting results.\n\n“It has been a steep learning curve for everyone connected with the club and the squad that did not have a lot of Premier League experience at the start of the season.\n\n“But they can draw on their experiences, good and bad, and now we must plan and develop the squad.”\n\nThe QPR manager, Chris Ramsey, felt the defeat summed up the story of their miserable season as they were condemned to bottom spot. “It was very disappointing as some of our defending was schoolboy and we weren’t able to capitalise on the few chances we had at crucial points of the game,” Ramsey said. “That has probably been the story of our season, we didn’t take our chances at 2-0 and then the game goes away from you. I thought there was a pride in the performance, in the effort but not the quality. That’s the reason we’re in this position, we do good things but then undo it with lack of concentration.\n\n“We had quite a young bench and that is something that needs to be looked at as we only had one senior sub in Junior Hoilett.\n\n“The players who turned out gave what they had and they’ve been doing that all season, but in the end quality tells.”"}, {"date": "24/05/2015", "arena": "Etihad

predictable fashion, with a goal and a victory that helped ensure Manuel Pellegrini and Manchester City sail off into the close-season sunset in far more optimistic mood than once appeared likely.\n\nSix consecutive victories have left Pellegrini in a solid second place in the Premier League and suitably bullish about his short-term job prospects, the manager becoming increasingly outspoken in recent days in response to those who question the security of his position.\n\nBut even allowing for that fact, and the long-known departure of Lampard, this will undoubtedly be a summer of upheaval for last season’s champions, not least with Uefa looking increasingly likely to loosen the shackles of financial fair play. And, as City supporters paid a dutiful, and fond, farewell to one of Chelsea’s most famous sons, it was the future of two of Lampard’s midfield team-mates that offered greater cause for concern.\n\nJames Milner is yet to accept the offer of a new contract and may well use his free agent status to move to a club that can offer more regular first-team starts, and Yaya Touré has begun his annual flirtation with the transfer market via the unsubtle declarations of his agent.\n\nAll three were brought off by Pellegrini, although the City manager insisted that Touré and Milner were substituted for physical, not sentimental, reasons and he expects clarity soon over their futures.\n\n“We will see, not only with those two names, who will stay here,” he said. “James said he would take a decision at the end of the season and it just depends on what he wants to do with his future. We must respect that. He is a very important player and gave us a lot of spirit the whole year but he must decide his future.”\n\nPellegrini looks far more likely to return than either of his midfielders. The sequence of wins has ended the season with a statement of intent, even if it was a case of far too little too late in their attempts to retain their title. The chairman, Khaldoon al-Mubarak, was here, although Pellegrini remained relaxed about the prospect of the end-of-season review that Mubarak’s presence suggested may have taken place on Sunday night. “I’m always talking with Khaldoon every week,” said the City manager. “I don’t need a special meeting with Khaldoon. But of course when you finish the season you must analyse what we did, where we made mistakes, where we must improve, but we have very good communication.”\n\nLampard struck just after the half-hour to ensure that Pellegrini had a comfortable enough conversation with his employer after David Silva had found Milner on the right and the England midfielder’s low cross picked out the unmarked veteran for an unstoppable eight-yard finish.\n\nWith Southampton impressing until the end, the victory was not secured until the 88th minute when a deflected Jesús Navas shot was headed across goal by Eliaquim Mangala for Sergio Agüero to nod in the 26th goal of his Golden Boot-winning season.\n\n“I spoke before the game with the whole squad and said it was important to finish the season here with a win in front of our own fans,” said Pellegrini. “But it was also important for Frank. It was the perfect afternoon, the perfect goodbye for him and he deserves it, for his brilliant career, and the fact he is a great person.”\n\nFor Southampton’s manager, Ronald Koeman, the season will not be over until Saturday’s FA Cup final when an Arsenal victory would assure his team of a place in the Europa League. “If we get the chance to play in Europe, I would like that because it means a lot for the club, a lot for the players,” he said. “We are preparing our pre-season and next week we will know if we have two qualifying games before the Premier League starts. We did a great job this season, the players showed their qualities, the spirit in the team was amazing. Even today, we tried to play attractive, offensive football and if we finish seventh, that’s our title – behind the big six clubs in the Premier League.”"}, {"date": "24/05/2015", "arena": "St James' Park, Newcastle", "attendance": 52094, "home_team": {"name": "Newcastle United", "lineup": [{"name": "Tim Krul", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daryl Janmaat", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mike Williamson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fabricio Coloccini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paul Dummett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Vurnon Anita", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [89]}, {"name": "Jack Colback", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Moussa Sissoko", "yellows": [54], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [54], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Emmanuel Riviere", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonás Gutiérrez", "yellows": [86], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [85], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Papiss Cisse", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Ryan Taylor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Siem de Jong", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yoan Gouffran", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [89], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ayoze Pérez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rémy Cabella", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sammy Ameobi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Freddie Woodman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "West Ham United", "lineup": [{"name": "Adrián", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Carl Jenkinson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Reece Burke", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [69]}, {"name": "Winston Reid", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Cresswell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cheikhou Kouyaté", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [77]}, {"name": "Alex Song", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stewart Downing", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin Nolan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Enner Valencia", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [63]}, {"name": "Carlton Cole", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "James Tomkins", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [69], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matthew Jarvis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nene", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joey O'Brien", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Morgan Amalfitano", "yellows": [80], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [63], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jussi Jaaskelainen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Elliot Lee", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [77], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Edin Dzeko struck his first league goals of the season to the relief of all at Manchester City and none more so than Eliaquim Mangala. Dzeko and Sergio Agüero scored to put Manuel Pellegrini’s team in command within 11 minutes against Hull but the visitors contrived to throw away the two-goal advantage, with Mangala highly culpable.\n\nThe French defender scored an own goal and conceded a penalty, which was converted by Abel Hernández as the home side rallied. Pellegrini’s team looked in danger of losing more ground on Chelsea, their main rivals for the Premier League title, until Dzeko struck City’s third goal midway through the second half after fine work from David Silva before the substitute Frank Lampard scored his fourth goal in three matches to finally make the game safe.\n\nMangala, 23, joined City from Porto for £32m in the summer and was impressive on his debut against Chelsea a week ago. This was not such a good day. “You cannot analyse a player in one match,” Pellegrini said. “In the last match he was wonderful and everyone was saying he’s the best defender in the world. Now, he has conceded an own goal and a penalty. He is only a young player, but not too young for the Premier League. He has a lot of experience. He has been a champion three times and played a lot in the Champions League, played for France and won titles in Portugal. He was wonderful for us against Chelsea last week and he will continue to play in our team.”\n\nThe visitors made five changes to the team that cruised to a 7-0 victory against Sheffield Wednesday in midweek, but the retention of Willy Caballero was the most eye-catching of Pellegrini’s selection. The Argentinian goalkeeper was signed from Pellegrini’s former club Málaga for £6m in the summer with the intention of keeping Joe Hart on his toes, though the England goalkeeper is expected to return to face Roma in the Champions League on Tuesday.\n\nHull have now conceded 13 goals in their past five matches and there was a glimpse of this fragility after only 39 seconds when Agüero breezed into the penalty area before firing at Allan McGregor from a tight angle.\n\nIt was an early warning sign and after seven minutes the champions where ahead. Hull’s defending was already becoming frantic and a failure to clear their lines fully was punished. Pablo Zabaleta outjumped Livermore to win a header 15 yards out and Agüero volleyed expertly across McGregor to find the bottom corner for his fourth goal of the season.\n\nIt took just four minutes for things to get worse for the hosts. Silva found room to release a pass to Dzeko on the corner of the penalty area, from where the Bosnia striker cut inside Liam Rosenior before lashing in a sweet right-footed shot to make it 2-0. Even at that early stage, it looked ominous for Steve Bruce’s side but they got a slice of fortune to gain a foothold in the game. Ahmed Elmohamady’s pass down the right released Rosenior, whose curling cross was headed by Mangala beyond Caballero. At the opposite end of the field, it would have been considered a fine finish.\n\nSuddenly, Hull looked interested in attacking and a confident ten minutes from the hosts ended with an equaliser from the penalty spot after another Mangala error. This time the Frenchman’s clumsy challenge brought down Hernández as he chased Mohamed Diamé’s chipped pass. The Uruguayan Hernández, a £10m signing from Palermo, demanded the ball before calmly sending Caballero the wrong way from 12 yards.\n\nYaya Touré cracked a shot against the post but was otherwise subdued. The champions needed a spark of inspiration from somewhere and it came with 22 minutes left through Silva. The Spaniard carried the ball from right wing to left, across the face of the Hull defence, before slipping it to Dzeko, whose low, first-time finish squeezed between Rosenior and McGregor and into the corner.\n\nAs Hull poured forward looking for another leveller, they always risked being caught on the break and so it proved as Zabaleta reached the byline to cut the ball back for Lampard to finish from inside the six-yard box.\n\n“We had an awful start but it shows the character that we’ve rolled their sleeves up and got back into it,” said Bruce. “For a good hour, it could have gone either way. We gave it a right good go, it just didn’t go for us. If you’re champions of this country you’ve got to be a class act and they are.”"}, {"date": "24/05/2015", "arena": "Bet365 Stadium", "attendance": 27602, "home_team": {"name": "Stoke City", "lineup":

and, long before the end, the question of whether it might be time for another farewell had elbowed its way to the top of the agenda.\n\nBrendan Rodgers faces a review of Liverpool’s season of frustration with the club’s owners and the manager’s demeanour after this wretched afternoon betrayed realism and, perhaps, a little anxiety – not least when he said that he accepted there would be doubts over his future after this and, more generally, the whimper that has been the final two months of the season.\n\nLiverpool were 5-0 down at half-time, utterly humiliated at the hands of a rampaging Stoke City, and, to put it bluntly, these are the sort of performances that see clubs and managers part company. It set the seal on a miserable end to the season for Rodgers and Liverpool, one in which the team lost six of 11 matches in all competitions and finished with 52 Premier League goals. They got 101 last season.\n\nRodgers dropped Raheem Sterling in the wake of the negative headlines over the winger’s future intentions, saying he felt that “there were other players mentally better positioned to play in the game”. But the focus here fell upon Rodgers and whether he could recover from this low point. It was Liverpool’s heaviest defeat since the 7-2 at Tottenham Hotspur in 1963.\n\nThe lone positive for the visitors came when Gerrard ran through in the 70th minute to slot a low shot past Asmir Begovic and there was the heart-warming moment when the Stoke fans rose with their Liverpool counterparts to applaud him. Yet it was otherwise an afternoon of angst and soul-searching for Rodgers and all of those connected to the club.\n\nStoke’s performance was testament to the mentality that Mark Hughes has instilled as well as the fitness methods – the manager’s teams always finish the season strongly. Stoke were already assured of a ninth-placed finish for the second year in succession yet they played as if their lives depended on the result. Their aggression, tempo and precision served to highlight Liverpool’s deficiencies.\n\nSterling’s omission from the starting XI had created the pre-match buzz and the substitute was jeered by plenty of travelling supporters by the tunnel in the corner as he returned to the dressing room after the warm-up. When Sterling emerged to warm up midway through the first half, he ran to the other corner, away from the Liverpool fans. “One greedy bastard,” bellowed the home crowd. Some of those in the visiting enclosure applauded the sentiment.\n\nLiverpool’s woes ran far deeper. This was a bitter and unforgiving occasion for them – a little like the micro-climate at this wind-swept arena; Gerrard will miss all of this when he joins Los Angeles Galaxy – and it was shocking to see how Rodgers’ team wilted, after the mess that was the opening goal. Simon Mignolet could only parry Charlie Adam’s shot at the feet of Mame Biram Diouf and the striker scored from close range.\n\nRodgers had started with Adam Lallana and Philippe Coutinho up front – in other words, without an orthodox striker. It looked as though he did not have a defence, either. The manager replaced the full-backs, Emre Can and Alberto Moreno, at the interval. He could have taken off anybody.\n\nLiverpool routinely lost out in the one-on-one duels and Stoke simply ran all over them. Diouf got his second with a viciously swerving shot from the edge of the area, which Mignolet could not lay a glove on, while the third followed a comical back header from Can which found only Jon Walters. His first effort was well saved by Mignolet but Walters reacted sharply to loop a header home.\n\nLiverpool fans could be seen heading for the exit with 31 minutes on the clock and it did not appear that they were merely trying to beat the half-time pie queue. The Stoke fans were shouting the Olés after 32 minutes and it would get even better for them before the interval. After more slapdash Liverpool defending and with Martin Skrtel backing off, Adam strode through to drive low into the corner before Steve N’Zonzi bent a magnificent shot past Mignolet from outside the area. Rodgers was barracked as he walked into the tunnel at half-time.\n\nLiverpool managed to stick their fingers in the dyke during the second half. Skrtel was a little fortunate to escape a second yellow card for a foul on Nzonzi and Lallana was thwarted by Begovic before Gerrard got his goal. But Marko Arnautovic ought to have scored for Stoke on 67 minutes and the substitute and former Liverpool striker, Peter Crouch, enjoyed the last word when he headed home unmarked from Diouf’s cross.\n\nMan of the match Mame Biram Diouf (Stoke City)"}, {"date": "20/05/2015", "arena": "Emirates Stadium", "attendance": 59987, "home_team": {"name": "Arsenal", "lineup": [{"name": "David

That, however, is not part of the make-up of this Premier League. There was no holding back during a game that rose extravagantly to the boil and it was a wonder it finished goalless. There were chances at both ends, particularly during a gripping second-half, many of them of crystal clarity.\n\nYet the point apiece served everyone well, especially Sunderland, who could celebrate the retention of their top-flight status ahead of their final fixture at Chelsea on Sunday. The emotions ran wild at full time, with the travelling supporters cavorting in delight and Dick Advocaat breaking down in tears for what he would later say was the first time in his long career.\n\nEmotions snowball for Dick Advocaat after Sunderland clinch safety | Amy Lawrence Read more\n\nAdvocaat has achieved the ends of his short-term managerial brief and he said that he and his players had defied the odds and the naysayers. When he took over in mid-March, the club sat 17th in the table, one point above the drop zone. His record reads impressively – W3 D3 L2 – and there have been calls for him to extend his stay in the north-east by another season before he retires. Advocaat has said that this will be his last managerial job. He will decide on his future next week.\n\nAdvocaat and several of his players made the point that Sunderland could not keep on living like this, dicing with their Premier League status so routinely. With the facilities and the talent at the club, they had to be better. But this was an occasion to exhale or, to paraphrase Advocaat, let it all hang out.\n\n“My emotions came out when my friend [and assistant] Bert van Lingen came over, we have been 25 years together, and he started crying,” Advocaat said. “He said: ‘Let it go,’ so I said: ‘Why not?’ I didn’t need so much encouragement. Nobody expected this. We had nine games when we took over, and five away from home, including Arsenal and Chelsea. But we did it, with everybody together. To do it here, on our own, against a great team, gives me a special feeling.”\n\nFor Arsenal, the point has all but ensured a top-three finish – only a radical last-day swing of seven goals would usher Manchester United back into contention – and, for only the third time in 10 seasons, they will avoid a Champions League play-off. Arsène Wenger stands to be able to sell this season as a success, particularly if his team go on to beat Aston Villa on Saturday week to retain the FA Cup.\n\nWenger, though, lamented a lack of sharpness from his players, a legacy, he said, of the exertions from Sunday’s 1-1 draw at United – a result that has come to look more important. Arsenal have failed to score in their last three home games. “We didn’t look like scoring, honestly,” Wenger said. “Even if we had 28 shots on goal. There was always something missing.” There are worries, Wenger admitted, ahead of the Cup final.\n\nAdvocaat was indebted to Costel Pantilimon, the goalkeeper, who made a string of fine saves but he could also point to the four clear chances that his team created and passed up in the second half. Steven Fletcher, on for the ineffective Danny Graham at half-time, spurned three of them, although his general play was worthy of praise.\n\nFrom Adam Johnson’s pass, Fletcher was confronted by David Ospina only for the goalkeeper to block. On the hour, following a quick and direct break, the striker was again one-on-one with Ospina but fluffed the dinked finish. Fletcher will also wonder how he did not convert from close range after Patrick van Aanholt had flashed a shot across goal, while the Dutch full-back had earlier shot tamely at Ospina from Jermain Defoe’s pass.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Costel Pantilimon and John O’Shea embrace to celebrate Sunderland’s survival. Photograph: Mike Egerton/PA\n\nArsenal called the tune in the first half, pushing Sunderland back with trademark interchanges. The visitors struggled to escape their half. Jack Wilshere, who made his first start since 22 November, was thwarted at close quarters by Pantilimon and blazed another chance over from Aaron Ramsey’s ball.\n\nSanti Cazorla worked Pantilimon; Mesut Özil lashed over from Wilshere’s cute dink and Olivier Giroud scooped wide after a similar tee-up from Wilshere. It was all very pretty but lacking in punch.\n\nSunderland measured their success in tackles won, closing down and blocks. John O’Shea and Sebastián Coates were excellent in central defence while Lee Cattermole snapped, snarled and generally irritated Özil.\n\nSunderland came out as an attacking force after the interval but Arsenal remained threatening. Hector Bellerín made inroads up the right and from his crosses, Giroud and Kieran Gibbs drew eye-catching saves out of Pantilimon. Alexis Sánchez had a shot blocked by Coates.\n\nThe visitors drank in a moment of good fortune when Ramsey’s cross hit Billy Jones and cannoned off the post while the Arsenal substitute Theo Walcott went close before forcing the save of the evening from Pantilimon.

that the repercussions of a chastening night will be felt at the beginning of the next campaign.\n\nTwo goals from the impressive Saido Berahino – his 19th and 20th of the season – and another from Chris Brunt secured a memorable victory for West Bromwich Albion and inflicted Chelsea’s heaviest league defeat under Mourinho since 2006. Yet it was the bizarre red card that Cesc Fàbregas received in the 30th minute that riled the Portuguese more than anything.\n\nMike Jones, the referee, was dealing with a melee on the other side of the penalty area after Diego Costa had been booked following an off-the-ball altercation with Gareth McAuley, when Fàbregas, stood about 20 yards away, kicked the ball in the direction of a crowd of Albion players and caught Brunt on the side of the head.\n\nChelsea’s Ruben Loftus-Cheek hopes for an encore after a difficult audition | Conrad Leach Read more\n\nDarren Fletcher, the Albion captain, reacted furiously and was straying close to the line – arguably overstepping it – when he confronted the Spaniard, almost running into him. Jones, on the scene moments later, reached for his back pocket and brandished the red card.\n\nThe offence will go down as violent conduct and means that Fàbregas, in what was essentially a meaningless game, has picked up a three-match suspension that rules him out of the final fixture of this term, at home against Sunderland, and, much more significantly, the first two matches of next season. The debate about whether the decision was harsh was guaranteed to go on long into the night but whatever the rights and wrongs of the sending off, there is no escaping the fact that it was a stupid thing for Fàbregas to do, especially when the referee was stood so close to Brunt.\n\nMourinho, not surprisingly, took a dim view of the referee’s decision-making and implied that a more experienced official than Jones would have handled it differently and taken a more lenient view.\n\n“I would like to see it again because what is this sending off for?” the Chelsea manager said. “Where is the danger of the situation? Where is the aggressivity in the situation to get a red card in a friendly game almost? I really don’t understand.\n\n“I think Fletcher was aggressive, yes. He pushes in the chest because he is experienced and he knows where he can push for a yellow card but it’s much more aggressive. What Fàbregas did, for me, a top referee, a stable big personality in control of the game goes there, two or three words, and he’s done. It’s a bizarre red card.” Mourinho suggested that Chelsea have no intention of appealing – “We lose all the time, we have a fantastic record on appealing,” he said sarcastically – but the Portuguese reacted with disbelief when told of the length of the suspension. “Three-game ban for this? Jesus Christ. Three-game ban for this? Harsh? Of course it’s harsh, if you get three games with this.”\n\nIt was that sort of night for Chelsea as Albion followed up their 1-0 win over Manchester United earlier in the month with another highly impressive result. While Mourinho had a point when he suggested that Chelsea would have played better if the title was not already in the bag – “I think this is a consequence of being champions so early,” he said in defence of their performance – Albion deserve credit for the way in which they punished the visitors.\n\nBerahino was in the mood from the start and with the transfer window soon to open, chose a good evening to showcase his talent. His first goal, beautifully curled into the far corner from about 22 yards, set Albion on their way after nine minutes and the 21-year-old also won and converted the penalty, after John Terry scythed him down, that doubled their lead two minutes after the restart.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Saido Berahino tucks his penalty past Thibaut Courtois.

Brunt played a short corner with Craig Gardner and from just inside the penalty area, unleashed a powerful shot that seemed to beat Thibaut Courtois for pace as it flew inside his near post.\n\nMourinho gave Isaiah Brown, a former Albion schoolboy, his first senior appearance for Chelsea when he brought him on as a late substitute, but even the sight of ‘the one that got away’ was

could be missing. Four days after celebrating his 32nd birthday – with or without a cake – Touré accepted a couple of gifts from Lukasz Fabianski to score twice and guarantee City a place in the group stage of the Champions League next season.\n\nJoe Hart was nothing like as obliging at the other end of the pitch and produced one save in particular that will live long in the memory. With Swansea trailing 3-2 and only eight minutes remaining, Federico Fernández sent a towering header towards the top corner only for Hart, at full stretch, to flick the ball over with his left hand. The stunned expressions of the players said it all. “Incredible, 99 times out of 100 that’s a goal,” Garry Monk, Swansea’s manager, said.\n\nHart’s work for the afternoon was not done and moments later the England goalkeeper repelled a Bafétimbi Gomis header from close range as Swansea continued to push for a third. City, though, had been a constant threat in the second half and when Wilfried Bony came off the bench to warm applause five minutes from time there was a sense of inevitability about what would follow. Bony, in keeping with the script, rolled in City’s fourth in injury-time and a compelling game was over.\n\nIt was breathless stuff at times and from City’s point of view showcased some superb attacking football and, not for the first time this season, suspect defending. Eliaquim Mangala endured another difficult day and was fortunate that Hart had got him out of jail earlier in the game, when the England goalkeeper tipped Nathan Dyer’s shot round a post after the Swansea winger had picked the Frenchman’s pocket.\n\nUltimately, though, City had too much going forward for a Swansea team that followed that defensive masterclass at Arsenal on Monday night with a much more expansive performance here. “We got criticised on Monday for apparently not playing so I wanted the players to show to the world we can go toe-to-toe with one of the bigger teams,” said Monk, whose team will finish eighth, their highest position in the Premier League era.\n\nManuel Pellegrini was spot-on when he described this as a “beautiful game for fans”. There were mistakes, superb saves, lovely passages of football and great goals, as well as a couple of well-deserved ovations. All four sides of the ground clapped when Frank Lampard, who spent three months on loan at Swansea at the start of his career, was substituted in the second half.\n\nBy that stage Lampard had left his mark on the game. Picking the ball up deep inside the City half, the 36-year-old played an exquisite volleyed pass that was inch perfect for Sergio Agüero to run on to in the inside-left channel. Agüero played in James Milner and the England international made the rest look remarkably simple as he checked inside Neil Taylor and found the far corner.\n\nTouré, whose agent has said that he is 90% certain to leave this summer, had earlier scored City’s first, and his 50th in the Premier League, with a low shot that beat Fabianski at his near post – the Swansea keeper got a good hand to the ball – via a deflection off Ashley Williams. City looked to be coasting but Swansea got back into the game when Gylfi Sigurdsson stroked a beautiful 18-yard shot beyond Hart.\n\nChances came and went in the early stages of the second half, with Hart thwarting Jonjo Shelvey and Fabianski making a fine double-save to keep out David Silva and Jesús Navas. Swansea, however, levelled in the 64th minute when Jazz Richards picked out Gomis and the Frenchman, holding off a challenge from Martín Demichelis, fired across Hart.\n\nBack came City. Driving at the Swansea defence, Touré shrugged off a challenge from Jack Cork and thumped a low right-footed effort from outside the area that, once again, sneaked inside Fabianski’s near upright. Mindful of how well Fabianski has played this season, Monk refused to criticise the Swansea keeper. “He’s been unbelievable for us,” he said.\n\nIt was left to Bony to have the final word. The former Swansea forward coolly dispatched City’s fourth, and only his second since joining the club in a £28m deal in January, to rack up a fifth successive win. It was Hart, though, who got all the plaudits. “I think he is starting to reach the peak of his career,” Pellegrini said.\n\nMan of the match Joe Hart (Manchester City)"}, {"date": "17/05/2015",

Gea’s final performance for Manchester United at Old Trafford and, if the suspicion is correct and he is bound for Real Madrid, it is fair to say he cannot have expected it to end with such an unorthodox farewell game. Arsenal played at times as if it would have been impudent to trouble the Spaniard. They did not manage a shot of any description in the opening half, the first time that has happened since a game against Liverpool in 2004, and De Gea’s vast appreciation society in Manchester will have noted how the recovery took shape only after he was forced off during the second half.\n\nUntil then it was strange to the point of bewildering that Arsenal could be so prosaic, even in an age when the rivalry between these clubs is so diluted that the big match-up is now Francis Coquelin versus Ander Herrera rather than Patrick Vieira against Roy Keane and all their see-you-out-there history.\n\nThey waited until the 51st minute before any of their players felt emboldened enough to try a shot and, even then, Alexis Sánchez’s effort was wildly off target. After that De Gea produced one save from Olivier Giroud to demonstrate why the crowd spent so long imploring him to reject Madrid’s advances. He was hurt stretching to punch away a cross, after 72 minutes, and what happened next was cruel on Victor Valdés, making his first appearance in United colours, and fortunate in the extreme for Arsène Wenger’s team.\n\nValdés had not even got his gloves on the ball for a reassuring first touch by the time one substitute, Theo Walcott, ran at another, Tyler Blackett, and drove what was intended to be a cross in the vicinity of the goal. The ball took a killer deflection off Blackett, wrong-footed the former Barcelona goalkeeper and flew into the far corner for an equaliser of supreme fortune.\n\nArsenal had at least started to play with enough momentum to feel they deserved their luck and they could also think back to several late breaks when they might have won the match, most notably with the shot that Giroud turned into the side-netting two minutes later. Yet a draw was probably fair. The truth is neither team excelled and it was clear why two sides that once locked horns for the top honours are now arguing over third and fourth place.\n\nLouis van Gaal must have been startled, for example, by the way his United side lost their defensive shape in the final 20 minutes.\n\nValdés was so unprepared after De Gea had strained his hamstring that the game was delayed by almost three minutes as he scrabbled to get his kit ready. Collectively the home side had a dishevelled look when play finally restarted, frequently vulnerable to Arsenal’s counterattacks.\n\nBefore then United had been the better team and fully deserving of the moment, half an hour in, when the game’s outstanding performer, Ashley Young, crossed from the left and Arsenal’s defence was so preoccupied with crowding out the obvious target, Marouane Fellaini, they left Herrera unmarked at the back post to score with an expertly controlled volley. Herrera and Juan Mata have now scored 18 goals between them this season.\n\nUnited still have imperfections but they do appear to have solved the long-standing issue, post-Scholes, of not getting enough goals out of their midfielders.\n\nThey also have a left-sided midfielder who might think it extremely unjust if his 19-month exile from the England team is not ended when Roy Hodgson announces his squad on Thursday for next month’s games against the Republic of Ireland and Slovenia. Young has been rejuvenated under Van Gaal and would be a contender for the club’s player-of-the-season award ceremony on Tuesday if De Gea were not such an obvious choice.\n\nYoung was instrumental in United’s first-half superiority, when the home side passed the ball with confidence and Arsenal’s only chance comprised a comedic moment when Phil Jones slipped under pressure and almost left Giroud with a clear run at goal. Jones managed to turn what could have been a costly fall into a gurning, sprawling, ground-level header – imagine, perhaps, a stricken buffalo sliding across a freshly polished floor – and showed great bravery bearing in mind the close proximity to Giroud’s studs. Otherwise there was nothing in that period to put the tiniest of grass stains on De Gea’s kit. “Too timid, too conservative, too far away from each other,” was Wenger’s verdict.\n\nHe was far more satisfied with the way the game ended – “We took over,” the Arsenal manager said – when Aaron Ramsey became increasingly involved and Blackett’s arrival coincided with United’s defence repeatedly being stretched.\n\nBy that stage Radamel Falcao had left with a polite wave to the crowd. The Colombian lasted only an hour and it was another performance that brought back memories of Diego Forlán and made it seem inconceivable that United would pay the £43.2m Monaco want to turn his loan arrangement into a long-term deal.\n\nThe bigger issue for United is what happens with De Gea. Van Gaal did not sound overly hopeful of keeping him at Old Trafford but for now the only certainty is that, if Madrid get their man – and they generally do – Valdés will hope for better luck next season.\n\nMan of the match Ashley Young (Manchester United)"}, {"date": "16/05/2015", "arena": " Mary's Stadium", "attendance": 31636, "home_team": {"name": "Southampton", "lineup": [{"name": "Paulo

It was great because it’s our last home game and the fans deserved this one because they had an amazing support of the team.”\n\nSouthampton took the lead after 13 minutes.

Mané reacted quickly to score from an acute angle.\n\nConfidence was soaring through the home side. Long burst down the left after some fine team play and cut the ball back for Mané to send a firm strike into the Villa net and complete his hat-trick. Given was soon beaten again, with Mané again playing an important role. Showing quick feet and impressive vision, he put Pellè through. The Villa goalkeeper’s save again fell kindly for the hosts as Long slotted home.\n\nAfter 38 minutes, Long wrestled the ball away just inside the Villa half and burst forward, before taking aim from 40 yards and beating Given with an incredible, curling strike.\n\nIn first-half stoppage time, Villa scored. Leandro Bacuna whipped in a cross from the right and Christian Benteke rose highest to put an exceptional header past the goalkeeper Paulo Gazzaniga.\n\nBut that did little to improve the visiting support’s mood and they booed their team off at half-time.

I’m not just talking about defenders, midfielders, attackers – the coaching staff, everyone who was involved at this football club has to take responsibility, and we do. It wasn’t good enough. We feel very sorry for our travelling fans who stuck with us right until the end, and Aston Villa fans around the country and around the world.\n\n“Since I’ve been in the club those are the only 45 minutes I can complain about. We have to not get too carried away and put it behind us.” PA"}, {"date": "16/05/2015", "arena": "Turf Moor", "attendance": 18636, "home_team": {"name": "Burnley", "lineup": [{"name": "Tom Heaton",

expects Danny Ings will leave relegated Burnley this summer after watching the sought-after striker try, and fail, to sign off at Turf Moor with a goal.\n\nA low-quality goalless draw against Stoke – which gave the visitors a club-record Premier League points tally of 51 – was hardly a fitting way for Ings to mark his exit, after a stellar rise since he signed for £1m from Bournemouth in 2011. Out of contract this summer, the 22-year-old has been linked with Liverpool, Manchester United and David Moyes’s Real Sociedad – with a fee to be determined by a tribunal.\n\n“It’s good to see his development,” said Dyche. “It looks like it won’t continue with us but we have played a big part. He and his agent have put the message out that they are looking at pastures new. Every player has the right to run down their contract if they want to – so we’ll see what happens in the summer.”\n\nIn the matchday programme, Ings paid tribute to the club, saying: “I came here as an 18-year-old boy and the first two years were extremely tough for me with injuries. Not only was I away from my friends and family, I didn’t really have anyone up here apart from team-mates.\n\n‘The lads and everyone at the club helped me settle well during one of the toughest times in my football career. Since then every year, I have grown more and more into a man and I can’t thank Burnley enough for everything they’ve done.”\n\nDyche bemoaned his side’s luck in front of goal against Stoke after a string of early chances were missed. “That has been a frustration all season, that is the reality of going up the levels, you have to take chances. Once again, generally it was a good performance, we defended well, we had good shape, good energy, created chances – got to take them. That’s the frustration this season for sure.”\n\nMark Hughes said he was proud of his club’s achievement, despite the underwhelming way of securing the record.\n\n“We got to 51 points, we are delighted with that, it’s a huge effort from everybody this year,” he said. “We got 50 last year and ninth position but we had to work harder for it this year, we’ve have had more injuries to key personnel that we’ve had to deal with but we have come though as a group and been really strong.\n\n“Today wasn’t anything like the level we hit last weekend, it was difficult conditions, I think everybody could see that. In the end we just found a way to make sure we took something out of it. Back-to-back top 10 finishes is something this club hasn’t done for 40-odd years so it’s a real achievement.

A tantalising opportunity to scramble clear of the condemned had presented itself here but, in the context of recent trauma, it felt apt that they eventually capitulated against a Queens Park Rangers team already resigned to life in the second tier and who had not mustered a home win since before Christmas.\n\nFor the visitors, this was a new nadir in a campaign already wrecked by strife and discord. John Carver had cut a helpless figure on the sidelines as his team wilted miserably after the interval, all the hope generated up to then effectively deflated by the youthful energy of Reece Grego-Cox, an 18-year-old striker flung on for his third top-flight appearance.\n\nSunderland 0-0 Leicester City | Premier League match report Read more\n\nThe teenager selflessly ran, harried and turned Newcastle’s ponderous defence at will, opening up space that Charlie Austin and Matt Phillips eagerly exploited.\n\nThe manner in which the visitors wilted was shameful, their back-line horribly slack and nerves gripping all over the pitch, but the reality is an injection of energy is all it takes to flummox them these days.\n\nThe manager, wearing that all too familiar haunted look, hardly inspired confidence in his post-match talk of hiding away from media coverage in the days ahead, of the pressure at life at a big club or even with his admission that the situation may simply have overwhelmed his players.\n\n“We’ve got eight days to get our heads round this scenario,” said Carver. “In the conditions, and given everything, at least they’ve had a go. Sometimes the quality’s not there and you’re just not good enough. Today might have been that situation. Papiss [Cissé] doesn’t usually miss chances like he did, but he did today. Pressure is a funny thing. If you take your eye off the ball, you get punished.”\n\nThe problem with that assessment was that QPR have been so abject themselves of late and, throughout the first half, had appeared to be sleep-walking their way apologetically back to the Championship.\n\nChris Ramsey, an interim desperate to secure the managerial position in these parts full-time, had needed a performance to carry into contract negotiations and at least his tweak at the interval did the trick.\n\nThere was renewed incision and urgency, Leroy Fer tucking back into midfield and the front-line reinvigorated. Newcastle duly fell to pieces.\n\nAustin, playing against one of the clubs who covet him, wriggled away from Fabricio Coloccini into space on the left of the penalty area before chipping a cross over Tim Krul. Matt Phillips met the delivery, but his shot flicked from Paul Dummett and just wide.\n\nThe visitors did not learn and, moments later, that same combination prised them apart again with Austin’s wonderful clipped cross nodded in by Phillips, leaping above Daryl Janmaat, at the far post.\n\nThat brought Newcastle’s nerves flooding back, the visitors panicked as opponents revelled in wide open spaces. Even Krul was affected, his attempted clearance reaching only Phillips who was more committed in the tackle than Ryan Taylor. The ball dribbled on to Fer, 25 yards out, whose belted shot flew viciously beyond Krul and, in seven brutal minutes, Newcastle had been dragged back from safety to the edge of the relegation zone. “We had a mad 10 minutes in that second half,” Carver said. In truth, they had merely slipped back into their customary inadequacy.\n\nThey should have killed off the game – and ensured their own safety – when they had been dominant. That first half felt an age away by the end, when the travelling fans were spitting their disgust at the owners, their dissatisfaction at the players and trading bottles and other missiles with the QPR fans who had invaded the pitch. There had been a time when Newcastle had appeared close to a first win since February, edging ahead when Krul’s punt downfield bypassed a dawdling Steven Caulker for Emmanuel Rivière to collect smartly at the centre-half’s back.\n\nTottenham Hotspur 2-0 Hull City | Premier League match report Read more\n\nThe Frenchman, alone in front of goal, slipped as he shot with his right foot but the ball, struck firmly into the turf, bounced over Rob Green’s attempt to smother to provide a first Premier League goal on his 22nd appearance, and after 1,087 fruitless minutes.\n\nGreen departed soon afterwards, clattered inadvertently by Joey Barton and requiring stitches in a head wound, with Alex McCarthy doing well to deny Coloccini a second.\n\nHad the second been pilfered then Newcastle might now be safe, surveying the scrap beneath them as they licked their season’s wounds. As it is, they must endure one more afternoon of torture, the late attempts to restore parity here through the substitute Cissé and Moussa Sissoko having yielded no rewards.\n\nA solitary point from a possible 30 tells its own story.

As he stepped off the pitch, Pearson paused for a moment and blew out his cheeks.\n\nLazarus had nothing on these Foxes and their coach who, back in February, was widely, if erroneously, reported as having been sacked. At the time Leicester looked to be sinking without trace and once oh-so complacent Sunderland were among those who dismissed the notion that an extraordinary renaissance could be about to unfold at the King Power Stadium.\n\nQueens Park Rangers 2-1 Newcastle United | Premier League match report Read more\n\nThree months on, the Wearsiders’ failure to win here excluded Dick Advocaat’s team from the sense of utter relief enveloping their guests. It also left them either requiring a point from their two remaining games at Arsenal and Chelsea or trusting that Hull fail to beat Manchester United at the KC Stadium next Sunday.\n\n“I’m not going to flower over it, I was relieved,” said Pearson whose side have collected 19 points from their last eight games. “At the final whistle I thought ‘Thank God for that’. Let’s face it, there’ve been low points this season. It’s difficult for newly promoted sides to establish themselves in the Premier League but this run has been singular. The important thing now is to enjoy the moment.”\n\nClearly deciding that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, Sunderland emulated Leicester’s recent habit of emerging fast out of the blocks and might have had a penalty within two minutes of the first whistle.\n\nWhen the lively Danny Graham crossed and Connor Wickham collapsed under pressure from Robert Huth, Martin Atkinson had a decision to make but, in rejecting Sunderland’s claims, the referee almost certainly came to the correct conclusion.\n\nWith the uber-industrious Graham particularly influential up front and Lee Cattermole eclipsing Esteban Cambiasso in the central midfield enforcement stakes, Kasper Schmeichel was the busier keeper. He did particularly well to flick out a hand and repel Sebastian Larsson’s swerving free kick before, later, saving Graham’s volley.\n\nThe striker had been cleverly cued up by Cattermole but the bad news for Advocaat was that his key midfielder would soon collect a style-cramping booking. Failing to heed a warning from Atkinson after clattering into Riyad Mahrez, Cattermole proceeded to hack down Mark Albrighton with un-seemly vigour and no one was surprised when the referee reached for his yellow card.\n\nIf their scoring chances were proving strictly rationed, Leicester regularly ruffled Sunderland with their penchant for getting the ball forward quickly and efficiently.\n\nAllied to a proficiency at set pieces, these tactics left John O’Shea and company grateful for some lucky deflections as the ball frequently bobbled across area.\n\nThe biggest early home scare came when Wes Morgan saw his goalbound shot blocked following a corner which had thoroughly confounded Advocaat’s rearguard. Considering that similar bewilderment had broken out before Jamie Vardy had a similar, close range, shot blocked, Pearson had cause for cautious optimism.\n\nSensing the power balance required a little recalibration, Advocaat replaced Liam Briductt with Adam Johnson. Almost immediately Johnson – greeted enthusiastically by a crowd of 46,705 – initiated a lovely passing move which ended with Patrick van Aanholt shooting narrowly wide.\n\nTottenham Hotspur 2-0 Hull City | Premier League match report Read more\n\nJohnson subsequently tested Schmeichel’s reflexes with a low shot of his own, unleashed after dodging Camabiasso but Pearson’s five-man defence remained impeccably organised – not to mention as stubbornly obdurate as their manager.\n\nPerhaps concerned his trusted “lucky” brown scarf – once again wrapped tightly around his neck – was not about to work its customary magic, Advocaat opted for further intervention, replacing Graham with Steven Fletcher.

He and Hull City must beat United at the KC Stadium on the final day of the Premier League season next Sunday and hope that Newcastle United or Sunderland fluff their lines if they are to avoid the drop into the Championship.\n\nHull would need Newcastle to fail to beat West Ham United at home or Sunderland to lose at Arsenal on Wednesday and then Chelsea at the last. The hope has not yet died but this was an afternoon of deflation for Hull against a Tottenham Hotspur team who hardly excelled but pieced together a couple of nice moments in the second half to decide the game.\n\nJake Livermore has let himself and everyone down, says Steve Bruce Read more\n\nÉrik Lamela and Ryan Mason teed up goals for Nacer Chadli and Danny Rose respectively, leaving Tottenham on course for another Europa League campaign.\n\nThe focus was on the battle-hardened Bruce and his players’ increasingly frantic attempts to dig themselves out of the mire. He said that Hull had played “manfully” and they created chances, with Nikica Jelavic hitting the woodwork in the 19th minute. But not for the first time, they lacked the requisite ruthlessness. After Chadli’s opening goal, the die felt cast. Hull have never won a Premier League game in May. They have to break the jinx against United or face the consequences.\n\n“I haven’t beaten Man U in 17 years [of management],” Bruce said. “Maybe there’s a twist in it. Maybe Man U owe me something after wrecking my knee and my hip and my ankle. We’ve got to try and be positive.”\n\nOn the corresponding Saturday last year, Hull were at Wembley for the FA Cup final against Arsenal but that heady day and the optimism fired by a £42m spending spree last summer feel as if lifted from another era. The mood is one of desperation and the revelation that the midfielder Jake Livermore had returned a positive test for cocaine during the week had hit everyone hard, not least Bruce.\n\nThe quality of this game was low but from Hull’s point of view, the result was the only thing that mattered. Mauricio Pochettino paced his technical area, and the Tottenham manager howled his frustration at the errors from his players before the goals. It was that sort of afternoon.\n\nHull had their moments in the first-half against a defence that continued to give the home crowd palpitations and, but for the upright, they would have led. Ahmed Elmohamady crossed and after Livermore’s replacement, David Meyler, had thrown himself at the ball, it fell to Jelavic at the far post. The striker, starting his first match in two months, slammed his shot against the top of the near post.\n\nHull had a small purple patch. Moments earlier, after Federico Fazio’s poor clearance, Dame N’Doye’s cross had been just too heavy for Jelavic, whose header, on the stretch, was off target, while there was the flicker when Jelavic burst through only for Eric Dier to snuff out the danger. Jelavic also sent an overhead kick wide. But that was about as good as it got for them.\n\nLamela was the most prominent performer and he was at the heart of the slim pickings for Tottenham in a forgettable first half. His early shot was deflected wide and he sent over a 13th-minute corner but the unmarked Dier headed wastefully wide. Lamela almost got on the end of a cross from Harry Kane while he scooped an effort past the post following good work by Mason.\n\nSunderland 0-0 Leicester City | Premier League match report Read more\n\nTottenham roused themselves in the second half and it was a moment of high class from Lamela that got them in front. The weight of the through-ball that he slipped through on James Chester’s blindside was matched by the vision. Chadli darted in, rounded Steve Harper and tucked home his 13th goal of the season for Spurs.\n\nThe travelling fans fell silent; Bruce looked crestfallen and things got worse for Hull shortly afterwards. Again, the assist was stamped with quality, Mason chipping delicately over the Hull back-line and Rose timing his run and an eye-catching right-foot volley that fizzed into the roof of the net. Rose sported a new, hi-viz red hairstyle. Nobody in amber and black had spotted him.\n\nHull toiled on with Paul McShane glancing a header wide from Tom Huddlestone’s cross. There was also the remarkable scramble in the 70th minute, when the substitute Abel Hernández hit Dier with one shot and then saw his follow-up cleared off the line by Fazio. On the third bite, N’Doye’s shot dribbled wide.\n\nBruce put his head in his hands.

Park farewell, then how fitting that it ended with the sound of boos ringing in his ears and the sight of a few West Ham fans unfurling a banner calling for his removal at the end where Romelu Lukaku had just scored the winner for Everton.\n\nThe message was succinct and to the point: “Big Sam Out”. Allardyce has been at West Ham for four years and although he can point to plenty of positives during his time in east London, the bald truth is that the majority of the locals simply do not like him.\n\nLiverpool 1-3 Crystal Palace | Premier League match report Read more\n\nWhen West Ham’s board weighs up the pros and cons of offering Allardyce a new deal at the end of the season, this defeat will surely go down as another tick in the negative column. West Ham were in the top four at Christmas but they have deteriorated since the turn of the year, injuries weighing them down, and there will be a sense of disappointment if they cannot claw back 10th place from Everton on the final day. Everton’s victory moved them above West Ham on goals scored.\n\nThe rumours over Allardyce’s future have swirled in recent weeks. His contract is up and the suspicion is that West Ham are minded to end what at times has resembled an unhappy marriage of convenience. They would love to tempt Rafael Benítez to east London.\n\nAllardyce defended his record. He won promotion in his first season and has kept West Ham in the Premier League. He regards Sunday’s trip to Newcastle United as business as usual.\n\nYet his confidence in his ability may not convince West Ham’s owners, David Gold and David Sullivan, that he is the man to take them forward. It is a results business and West Ham lost again.\n\nThat Lukaku was the architect of their demise, creating Leon Osman’s equaliser and heading the decisive goal past Adrián in stoppage time, was predictable. Lukaku loves playing against West Ham. This was his sixth goal in six games against them.\n\nThe consolation for West Ham is that they probably did enough to hold off Everton in the race to qualify for the Europa League via the fair play table – assuming, of course, that they regard that as something to celebrate.\n\nEverton had four players booked in the fair play clásico – Séamus Coleman, Gareth Barry, James McCarthy and the teenage debutant, Brendan Galloway – and Winston Reid was the only West Ham player who went into Kevin Friend’s notebook.\n\nThe West Ham fans chanted about going on a European tour but if that bonus Europa League spot is given to them, their season will begin with the first qualifying round on 2 July. There are three qualifying rounds, finishing on 6 August and then there is a two-legged play-off to reach the group phase. It will be a slog.\n\nSouthampton 6-1 Aston Villa | Premier League match report Read more\n\nAs for the present, it was a sickening way for West Ham to lose. Everton deserved to win, though. Their football was slicker, they created the better chances and they responded well after Stewart Downing had given West Ham the lead in the 62nd minute, curling a lovely shot past Tim Howard with his left foot after fastening on to a fine pass from Alex Song.\n\nWest Ham’s goal came during their strongest spell but they were predictable for long periods. Their 4-5-1 formation, with Carlton Cole on his own up front, rarely troubled Everton.\n\nOsman’s equaliser in the 67th minute was a beauty. Lukaku’s cross from the right was behind him, but he controlled the ball, held off Reece Burke, swivelled brilliantly and smashed a volley past Adrián from close range.\n\nThe Hammers keeper then made a spectacular save to deny Lukaku but he was helpless when a cross from the Everton substitute Aiden McGeady reached the Belgian at the far post in the dying moments.

Steven Gerrard’s emotional farewell to Anfield ended on the flattest of notes as Crystal Palace ruined his final outing on home soil and exposed Liverpool to the prospect of a worrying future without him. It was Norwich’s Jeremy Goss tripping up the Spion Kop’s last stand in 1994 all over again.\n\nGerrard rallied late on as he tried to rescue Liverpool one last time but to no avail. The 34-year-old’s shots sailed high and wide, prompting mocking tribute from the Kop and a thumbs-up in return from their departing hero, whereas Jason Puncheon and the Palace substitutes Wilfried Zaha and Glenn Murray hit the target to remind all not only of their presence at Anfield but their stirring potential under Alan Pardew.\n\nPainful end for Steven Gerrard, Liverpool’s superman for all seasons | Daniel Taylor Read more\n\nFor the second time this season Palace had beaten Brendan Rodgers’ team 3-1, completing the club’s first league double over Liverpool, and in Yannick Bolasie they possessed the most formidable talent on the pitch.\n\nRodgers complained legitimately over the visitors’ second and third goals – offside and a penalty for a foul outside the area – but the most accurate verdict on the day came from the Liverpool supporters themselves. The home crowd gave Bolasie a deserved standing ovation when he departed eight minutes from time. Later, when Gerrard was asked how bright the future looked for Liverpool next season, laughter rolled off the Kop.\n\nThe Liverpool manager stood in the crowd with a face like thunder before embarking on a lap of honour where his players trailed far behind their captain, just as they had done Palace throughout the game.\n\n“We started reasonably well and scored a fantastic goal but we made poor defensive errors across the field and they punished us,” Rodgers said.\n\n“Their second goal was offside and their penalty was clearly outside the box but that doesn’t take away that we could have done much better in the defensive moments of the game.”\n\nEvents before kick-off indicated Palace were not exactly at the forefront of Liverpool’s minds as Gerrard ended his warm-up by conducting a brief television interview in front of the Kop and both teams formed a guard of honour for the captain, appearing with his three young daughters in tow.\n\nThe game itself, however, must have been a release to the 34-year-old and his team-mates after a week of intense scrutiny and Liverpool did start with some purpose. The ceremonious atmosphere was reflected in the sky above Anfield where a plane flew carrying a banner that read “In Rodgers We Trust”. Liverpool’s previous home game, of course, had witnessed a very different fly-over when the manager looked up at a banner that read “Rodgers Out Rafa In”. Anfield’s aerial tit-for-tat demonstrated one thing: some people have far too much time and money to waste.\n\nLiverpool were gifted the lead from one of their former players and one of their supporters in the heart of the visiting defence. Martin Kelly played Scott Dann into trouble with a careless pass behind his central defensive colleague and Adam Lallana took full advantage, pressuring Dann into a slip, racing through from deep and sweeping an excellent finish into the top corner of Wayne Hennessey’s goal, then seeking out Gerrard for the celebration of only his fifth goal of an injury-hit season.\n\nAnfield says goodbye to Steven Gerrard – in pictures Read more\n\nPardew and Palace responded impressively, the manager switching Bolasie into the attack and his team were instantly more threatening as a result. Joe Ledley, Bolasie, Puncheon and Lee Chung-yong all went close or squandered clear chances before the visitors scored a fine and merited equaliser. Emre Can, tormented by Bolasie all game, conceded a free-kick 20 yards from goal with a trip on the Congo international. Puncheon marked his new four-year contract at Selhurst Park by sweeping the set piece into the bottom corner.\n\nThe men in yellow showed more urgency in the second half too and were incensed when the FA Cup final referee, Jon Moss, ignored two strong penalty appeals when Martin Skrtel handled Bolasie’s cross and then clipped Lee on the follow-up.

Having spent the best part of 85 minutes huffing and puffing without being able to muster much more than a light breeze in Lukasz Fabianski’s direction, Swansea took the opportunity to break upfield to blow their house down.\n\nWhen Bafétimbi Gomis, only just fit and sent on to make a nuisance of himself for the latter stages, jumped at Jefferson Montero’s cross to glance a powerful downward header goalwards, David Ospina could only claw the ball back from behind the line. The Colombian goalkeeper looked astounded to see technology confirm the surprise matchwinner which consigned Arsenal to their first defeat in the Premier League for three months. The quest to finish in the top three took a considerable knock.\n\nArsène Wenger responded with thinly veiled disdain. “The goal was not even a break,” he said. “We were unlucky against a team who refused to play completely and just defended.” Garry Monk considered the three points he was taking back to Wales and shrugged it all off. “If people don’t like that, it’s not my problem.”\n\nArsenal’s frustraton was summed up by the repeated sight of Fabianski, their old friend, invoking the immutable law of the ex. He saved everything with calm composure and the experience clearly meant a lot to him as he fell to the turf at the final whistle.\n\nAnother progressive season for Swansea under Monk was summed up by him dropping casually into the post-match conversation the fact his his team have done the double over both Arsenal and Manchester United.\n\nSwansea look increasingly likely to sup from the bittersweet chalice of the Europa League. Monk’s ambivalence about the merits of qualification, and the fact that they travelled with sufficient striker problems for Gylfi Sigurdsson to slot in at false nine, it would have been understandable if Swansea had been pliant visitors. Not so. They had a plan and it worked to perfection. “We have done it all season, had many games where we dominated games and won. There are times you have to be adaptable. The idea was to get to the last 20 minutes still in the game, make our substitutions and try to win the game.”\n\nThey got to the last 20 minutes through expert defensive organisation. “They played four defenders and six midfielders,” moaned Wenger. Swansea mostly kept Arsenal’s passing at a safe distance, shutting off the spaces pragmatically, and as the game wore on and Wenger’s creators began to pick the odd hole in their backline, Fabianski was always there – big, brave and solid.\n\nThe more he collected saves, the more Arsenal seemed to choke up when they got into shooting distance. Fabianski repelled superbly from Nacho Monreal and then the keeper suddenly appeared to take on supernatural qualities where he had a spell of inviting Arsenal players to shoot straight at him. Were they spooked? Alexis Sánchez, Theo Walcott and Santi Cazorla all more or less aimed at the Pole’s catch.\n\n“He’s been excellent for us,” enthused Monk. “When you set up like that you are going to have to ride a bit of those chances and hope the keeper makes good saves and bodies make those blocks.”\n\nWenger tried to shake it up by introducing two of the players who have had to wait patiently for chances, Jack Wilshere and Walcott, but neither could inspire a breakthrough.\n\nWenger conceded that his players “rushed” their finishing. “Fabianski did well. On some occasions we made it too easy for him,” he said. They then suffered the same punishment they did notoriously in the Champions League against Monaco during a low point of this campaign. “It was a question of being patient enough and, if we cannot win it, not to lose it.” That flaw reappeared at an inopportune moment.\n\nThe Arsenal manager stressed afterwards how his team have to prove this was “an accident” and urged them to repair some of the damage in their remaining games, starting on the weekend at Old Trafford.\n\nThanks to the blend of resilience and Gomis’s moment, Swansea’s Europa League prospects are looming. Monk was pretty realistic about the pros and cons. “I just treat it as it will be what it will be. We had a great experience last season, we are not scared of going into it. I know what people say about how it can affect league form. The planning in terms of recruitment will have to be increased. It is not my focus. Next week we will be pushing for three points.”"}, {"date": "10/05/2015", "arena": "Etihad Stadium", "attendance": 44564, "home_team": {"name": "Manchester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Joe Hart", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pablo Zabaleta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martín Demichelis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eliaquim Mangala", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aleksandar Kolarov", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [32], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fernando", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fernandinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [75]}, {"name": "James Milner", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [70], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [82]}, {"name": "Frank Lampard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [63]}, {"name": "David Silva", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [87], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sergio Agüero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [4, 50, 65], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Bacary Sagna", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Vincent Kompany", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Edin Dzeko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willy Caballero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wilfried Bony", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [63], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jesus Navas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [82], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yaya Touré", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [75], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Queens Park Rangers", "lineup": [{"name": "Robert Green", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Caulker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Richard Dunne", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Clint Hill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matt Phillips", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Karl Henry", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joey Barton", "yellows": [62], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Suk-Young Yun", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [86]}, {"name": "Leroy Fer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [78]}, {"name": "Charlie Austin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bobby Zamora", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [53]}], "subs": [{"name": "Shaun Wright-Phillips", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [86], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex McCarthy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Niko Kranjcar", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [78], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Junior Hoilett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [53], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Darnell Furlong", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Reece Grego-Cox", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Brandon Comley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "When the endgame arrived QPR politely ushered themselves out with barely a flicker of resistance. There was no arguing at the door, no recriminations or any real sense that they expected anything else. The worst team in the Premier League fetched their coat, left the premises and it was not particularly easy to imagine they might be back any time soon.\n\nQPR look a good fit for the Championship if they can fold this meekly and did anyone really believe that Clint Hill, Bobby Zamora and Karl Henry were the men to keep them in the top division?\n\n“He was here when we were shit,” the home fans sang about Richard Dunne, one-time Manchester City captain and prolific own-goal connoisseur. They meant it affectionately but, in another sense, it says something that the man assigned to subduing Sergio Agüero once went by the nickname of Honey Monster on this patch, back in the days when the wind howled and the curtains trembled.\n\nThat particular battle was predictably one-sided as the Argentinian’s hat-trick moved him to 31 goals for the season, his best total at City despite his recurring injury issues. QPR’s wage bill in the last few years has been higher at times than that of Atlético Madrid and Borussia Dortmund, both recent Champions League finalists – and not far off the entire total of Major League Soccer. Yet their lack of stardust is staggering and, if anything, it was just a surprise City did not turn their superiority into an even more emphatic scoreline.\n\nFor that, QPR were indebted to Rob Green’s goalkeeping, particularly in the second half when some of his colleagues hoisted the white flag. Green was exposed more times than he will want to remember but managed to emerge with some credit despite the frequency with which the ball was in his net. Unfortunately for QPR it was something close to chaos in front of him. Just consider the second goal as one example, as City broke from defending a corner, David Silva played the ball forward and Yun Suk-young let it go under his foot for Agüero to run clear. It was not the mistake that was incredible; it was the fact that QPR’s left-winger was their only man back.\n\nAgüero had opened the scoring inside four minutes and Manuel Pellegrini’s team played with so much authority that it was hard to comprehend how their title challenge had faltered so badly after the turn of the year. An allowance has to be made for the moderate standard of opposition – “no club this year has played against us this way,” Pellegrini said – but this was the crisp, stylish football that makes City a joy to watch on the good days.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Video: Chris Ramsey admitted QPR were ‘nowhere near’ Premier League quality against Manchester City, after a 6-0 defeat saw his team relegated.\n\nAgüero was rampant. Silva was at the hub of everything and QPR were a rabble. At the final whistle Junior Hoilett could hardly wait to get off the pitch. At least his team-mates did bother to go over to the away end to thank them for travelling.\n\nAgüero’s first goal was the culmination of a diagonal run, right to left, into the penalty area, eluding Hill first and then Matt Phillips before clipping his shot over Green.\n\nAleksandar Kolarov made it 2-0 with a free-kick from nearly 30 yards out and then it was just a question of how ruthless City were feeling and the scale of the away side’s capitulation. At one point Joey Barton, supposedly the heart and soul of this QPR team, gave the ball away with a sloppy pass from the wing and then simply stood in the manager’s technical area as play went on. By that stage Agüero had completed his hat-trick, firing the ball to Green’s right after Phillips had brought down Silva for a penalty that might have warranted a red card and more ignominy.\n\nSix minutes later Kolarov swung in a corner. The substitute Wilfried Bony headed on and Agüero slid the ball across the six-yard area to leave James Milner with a tap-in. It was simple, brutal stuff, even discounting the many occasions when City could feasibly have taken the scoring into new territory.\n\nBony struck the post with a shot of his own before playing in Silva to take the ball round Green and finish the scoring five minutes before the end.\n\nShortly beforehand Shaun Wright-Phillips had come on to cheers from City’s fans, remembering the player of old, and abuse from the away end, knowing him for what he is now: a symbol of the club’s excesses, making a fortune out of almost nothing.\n\nChris Ramsey at least brought a shred of dignity to the occasion with his post-match thoughts but the QPR head coach could not argue with Barton’s assertion that they had been undermined by “bad eggs” in the dressing room. Wright-Phillips was not one, he insisted, but the allegation was fair. “We have players who could have helped us who haven’t helped us.”\n\nRamsey was being generous when he tried to say his players had not given up but his own performance was considerably more impressive than his players and what a farce that QPR discovered on Friday that Sandro could not play because his visa had expired and nobody had apparently realised.\n\nIt is a mess and it might get worse before it gets better.\n\nMan of the match Sergio Agüero (Manchester City)"}, {"date": "10/05/2015", "arena": "Stamford Bridge",

An afternoon which had begun with a grudging show of respect for the newly crowned Premier League champions, the visitors lining up along either side of a blue carpet to form a guard of honour as Chelsea trooped triumphantly into the arena, ended with Champions League football effectively out of their reach. Given the constant and bellowed reminders of the destiny of this season’s title, this was a galling occasion for those in red.\n\nThe deficit from the top four has been extended to six points with two games to play, and goal difference counting horribly against them. As “outstanding” as Brendan Rodgers insisted his team were after the interval, this performance failed to yield the victory which would have preserved those fading chances. Instead, the talk in the aftermath was of a “big summer ahead” when shrewd recruitment, and presumably plenty of persuasion if key targets are to be secured, will be required if their challenge is to prove more persuasive next year. A Europa League campaign most likely awaits, and that will create its own disruption.\n\nIn truth Liverpool, as the team with something at stake, had felt the more threatening of the sides on show with Chelsea, as José Mourinho conceded, struggling throughout to generate proper intensity to their approach having already secured the campaign’s most glittering prize. Yet, for all that Raheem Sterling, Jordan Ibe and the league debutant, Jerome Sinclair, buzzed disconcertingly in enemy territory, supplied by the elusive Philippe Coutinho, the visitors lacked the quality to prevail. The Brazilian saw a late shot deflected off Gary Cahill to wrong-foot Thibaut Courtois for a split second, though the chance played out in slow motion and the goalkeeper was able to flop down on the loose ball. It all rather summed up Liverpool’s season, a campaign when the goals of Luis Suárez and Daniel Sturridge have been so sorely missed. They lacked bite here to inflict proper wounds.\n\nThe goals that were mustered in a disjointed contest were supplied by the old guard. John Terry’s opener had been thumped in early, Cesc Fàbregas’s corner veering into the penalty area for the centre-half to rise too easily above Rickie Lambert and plant a header down and beyond Simon Mignolet and Steven Gerrard on the goal-line. The goal was Terry’s 39th in the Premier League, establishing him as the highest scoring defender in the revamped top flight.\n\nLiverpool complained, with some justification, that his supplier should not have been on the pitch even then, Fábregas having been guilty of a nasty foul on Sterling’s right ankle in the opening 25 seconds. “He should have been sent off,” said Rodgers. “It was out of control, diving [in], stretching. A poor challenge.” Andre Marriner had actually flashed a red card at Mikel John Obi, so off the pace had he been in that opening minute, before correcting that to a lenient yellow for Fábregas. The confusion hardly inspired confidence.\n\nThe visitors’ response to the concession had actually been impressive, sparked as it was by Coutinho spitting shots at goal for Branislav Ivanovic to block and Courtois to save, though parity was only restored when their own captain made his presence felt. Ivanovic’s foul on Adam Lallana earned a free-kick which Jordan Henderson arced over the muddle in the six-yard box. Gerrard, having edged away from Mikel, was unmarked as he nodded in his first goal against these opponents in a decade.\n\nIt was his first ever reward at Stamford Bridge, an arena where he has been mercilessly heckled over the years, memories of which would not be erased by the charitable and admirable ovation granted him by all corners of the ground upon his substitution 11 minutes from time. Mourinho praised that reaction for the “dear enemy” who will not grace this stage again. Gerrard, himself, was not quite ready to forgive and forget.\n\nChelsea had actually been denied a potential farewell of their own, Petr Cech having cried off the fixture with a minor calf injury having been pencilled in to start the game. “The next game, at West Bromwich Albion [on Monday week], he plays,” said Mourinho, who intends to pick the likes of Nathan Aké and Isaiah Brown at the Hawthorns. “Izzy Brown came from West Bromwich so it’ll be special for the kid to play in that house … the boys deserve it, all of them, but I can’t give a special day for everyone.”\n\nHe offered Ruben Loftus-Cheek an hour here on his first Premier League start, with the teenager doing little wrong in a midfield brief before being withdrawn as his manager sensed Liverpool’s late urgency might leave him exposed. “Coutinho was getting more space between the lines, so it was best for the boy to leave,” added the Portuguese. “But it was a fantastic experience for him, to feel the intensity and the speed of the game. He’s going to be a Chelsea player, that’s no doubt. I’m happy.”\n\nThe same cannot be said for Liverpool, even with the point secured on a ground where Chelsea remain unbeaten in the league. For Rodgers, and the hierarchy at Anfield, a pivotal summer awaits.\n\nMan of the match Philippe Coutinho (Liverpool)"}, {"date": "09/05/2015", "arena": "Goodison Park", "attendance": 38246, "home_team": {"name": "Everton", "lineup": [{"name": "Tim Howard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Seamus Coleman", "yellows": [73], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Stones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Jagielka", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leighton Baines", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [74]}, {"name": "James McCarthy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gareth Barry", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [62]}, {"name": "Aaron Lennon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [86]}, {"name": "Ross Barkley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leon Osman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Romelu Lukaku", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Joel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aiden McGeady", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [86], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Arouna Kone", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin Mirallas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [62], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Naismith", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Muhamed Besic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Luke Garbutt", "yellows": [88], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [74], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Sunderland", "lineup": [{"name": "Costel Pantilimon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Billy Jones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sebastián Coates", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wes Brown", "yellows": [42], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Patrick van Aanholt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sebastian Larsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [84]}, {"name": "Lee Cattermole", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordi Gomez", "yellows": [65], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jermain Defoe", "yellows": [66], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [85], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Graham", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [53], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [74]}, {"name": "Connor Wickham", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [84]}], "subs": [{"name": "Liam Bridcutt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [84], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Fletcher", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [84], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Johnson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [74], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Anthony Reveillere", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Vito Mannone", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Santiago Vergini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Will Buckley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Relegation battles sometimes involve unlikely rescuers but rarely anyone quite this improbable. Centre-forwards should not be described as surprise scorers. When they are, it tends to combine criticism with mockery.\n\nYet when Danny Graham’s name rang around Goodison Park it was in praise and thanks. The enclave of Wearsiders celebrated a misfit who, in an instant, was transformed: the Newcastle fan turned Sunderland scorer. A lifeline came courtesy of one of the least lethal strikers in their history. Two and a half years after signing for Sunderland, 28 games into his Sunderland career, the much-maligned attacker finally found the net. So did a more regular, more reliable finisher in Jermain Defoe but Graham’s was the pivotal contribution.\n\nSunderland have had four managers in the time it has taken Graham to score a goal, but what a goal: not in its execution – frankly, he knew little about it – but in its importance. Sunderland, who acquired momentum in their final five games last season, may be timing their surge to safety perfectly again. They have recorded successive wins. Beat Leicester next Saturday and their task could be accomplished before the daunting end-of-season trips to Arsenal and Chelsea.\n\nFrom the rubble of a dreadful campaign, Sunderland have constructed their best run of the season. They have that heady cocktail of fortune and form. “We were lucky,” said their manager, Dick Advocaat. Perhaps, after the dubious dismissal of Southampton’s James Ward-Prowse at the Stadium of Light last week, it is becoming a theme. This time, Advocaat’s charges struck twice, once in dubious circumstances, while barely recording an intentional shot on target. “Everything that could have gone against us in our box did,” said the Everton manager, Roberto Martínez, who outlined his side’s dominance in statistical terms. “We had 22 attempts at goal, 15 corners and 75 percent of possession.”\n\nAdvocaat did not attempt to sugar-coat victory. “Everton were the better side,” he added, excusing the “brilliant” Lee Cattermole but accepting that Jordi Gómez and Sebastian Larsson lost the midfield battle. “It was not a great game by our side but it was very effective and that is what counts. At some moments they outplayed us but our back five did really well, including the goalkeeper.”\n\nAt the end of an uneventful first half, Costel Pantilimon saved twice in succession when Everton scythed Sunderland open. When Leon Osman found Romelu Lukaku with a perceptive pass, Pantilimon came off his line to deny the Belgian. Ross Barkley set up a second opportunity for Osman seconds later but he repelled that, too. And when Phil Jagielka’s header was bound for the top corner, Pantilimon clawed that away.\n\nWithin five minutes, Sunderland led. Gómez’s long-range, wayward shot took a telling touch off the unwitting Graham’s heel. His account was belatedly opened. “It has been a frustrating couple of years at the football club,” said Graham, with masterly understatement. Industry had brought an unexpected reward.\n\n“He worked hard,” said Advocaat. There was method in the manager’s apparent madness. While Graham’s presence on the score sheet was unexpected, his status on the team sheet was more understandable. He acted as the selfless, isolated target while his 10 team-mates set up camp behind the ball.\n\nThey even included Defoe, specialist predator reinvented as auxiliary right-back as he served as Billy Jones’ unlikely shield. Yet once Everton trailed, Sunderland were afforded opportunities to counterattack. Four minutes after Graham scored, Patrick van Aanholt slalomed forward to almost add a second goal, with a skied shot following a searing burst. With five minutes to go, Defoe made the most of a rare foray into enemy territory.\n\nGraham’s replacement Steven Fletcher embarked on a winding solo run, another substitute, Adam Johnson, shot and the ball bounced off Seamus Coleman to Defoe, who turned it in. “The ball hits his arm before it goes in the net,” said Martínez who noted a second offence. “John Stones gets impeded by Fletcher,” he explained. “The two goals are very unfortunate.”\n\nThe Everton manager’s grievances with the referee, Lee Probert, included events in both boxes. “Séamus Coleman is impeded by Defoe and it is clearly a penalty,” he added.\n\nThe Spaniard’s four-year spell at Wigan provided him with an MBA in escapology from relegation. He is aware the margins are narrow. “Sometimes the difference between staying up and not is the ball James McCarthy hits that hits the post,” Martínez said. The midfielder’s 73rd-minute shot thudded back off the woodwork. Everton were denied an equaliser. Sunderland survived. It may prove a microcosm of the season.\n\nInstead, the goal came at the other end. Graham’s replacement, Steven Fletcher, embarked on a winding solo run, another substitute, Adam Johnson, shot and the ball bounced off Coleman to Defoe, who turned it in. Perhaps he knew little about his finish either."}, {"date": "09/05/2015", "arena": "Villa Park", "attendance": 39294, "home_team": {"name": "Aston Villa", "lineup": [{"name": "Shay Given", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leandro Bacuna", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [77]}, {"name": "Jores Okore", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ron Vlaar", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kieran  Richardson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Cleverley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [31], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Westwood", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fabian Delph", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charles N'Zogbia", "yellows": [45], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [71]}, {"name": "Christian Benteke", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Grealish", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}], "subs": [{"name": "Brad Guzan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andreas Weimann", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gabriel Agbonlahor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [71], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Cole", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Philippe Senderos", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alan Hutton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [77], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Carlos Sánchez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "West Ham United", "lineup": [{"name": "Adrián", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Carl Jenkinson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Collins", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Reece Burke", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Cresswell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mark Noble", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [78]}, {"name": "Cheikhou Kouyaté", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stewart Downing", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin Nolan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Morgan Amalfitano", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Enner Valencia", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Matthew Jarvis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nene", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joey O'Brien", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jussi Jaaskelainen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Carlton Cole", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [78], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex Song", "yellows": [72], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Josh Cullen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "The Tim Sherwood effect continues to transform Aston Villa’s fortunes and Tom Cleverley has benefited as much as anyone in recent weeks. After failing to get a goal in his first 31 appearances for Villa and struggling to make much of an impact under Paul Lambert earlier in the season, Cleverley scored for the third match in succession to secure a crucial victory and lift Tim Sherwood’s side four points clear of the relegation zone.\n\nAvailable on a free transfer in the summer when his contract expires at Manchester United, Cleverley could not have picked a better time to run into form. Alongside the impressive Jack Grealish, the sometime England international caught the eye on a day when Villa recorded back-to-back home wins in the league for the first time in 14 months – a remarkable statistic that reflects the rot that had set in with Lambert in charge.\n\nSherwood was quick to stress the job is not yet done, although it would take a strange sequence of results to drag Villa back into trouble. In the worst case scenario Villa need three points from their final two matches, against Southampton away and Burnley at home, although that is working on the assumption other results go against them, including Hull beating Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester United in their final two fixtures.\n\n“We’re going in the right direction and it’s in our hands,” said Sherwood, who has won five of his 11 league games in charge. “We do our job and we’ll be in the Premier League next season. But I think you’re going to see a few twists and turns before the end. Everyone is getting unlikely results at the moment, that’s the problem.”\n\nWhile the margin of victory was slender, Sherwood was spot on when he described the game as being “as comfortable as it could be at this stage of the season”. With nothing to play for other than an unlikely route into Europe via the Fair Play table, West Ham were obliging opponents. Other than a James Collins header that Shay Given tipped over in the second half, Sam Allardyce’s side offered little and have now gone 11 league games without a win on the road.\n\nWith Villa dominant in the early stages, the only surprise was that it took 31 minutes for Cleverley’s goal to arrive. Grealish, who left the field to a standing ovation when he was substituted late on, was the architect. Picking the ball up wide on the left, the 19-year-old exchanged passes with N’Zogbia, ghosted past Stewart Downing and, from close to the byline, drilled a low left-footed centre across the six-yard box that implored Cleverley, totally unmarked, to tap home. “Pathetic” was the word Allardyce used to describe West Ham’s defending.\n\nAs for Cleverley, Sherwood will be doing everything in his power to keep the 25-year-old. “I know what he’s got, he’s full of energy, he’s easy to coach, you only have to tell him something once and he’s on it. He’s a very intelligent footballer. I’m pretty sure he’ll get back into the England squad very soon. We’ll talk to him at the end of the season, we’d like to keep him. But he’ll obviously have a few options. I’m just going to tell him if doesn’t sign he’s not playing in the Cup final!”\n\nAllardyce bemoaned the goal Enner Valencia had ruled out for offside in the second half – “The assistant referee is in no position to give a decision one way or the other because of his position” – but was scathing about West Ham’s toothless attack. “Whatever we do in open play, none of our players seem to be able to convert any of the chances into goals and because of that life is extremely difficult for us. It shows just how much we’re missing Andy Carroll and Diafra Sakho.”"}, {"date": "09/05/2015", "arena": "KCOM Stadium", "attendance": 24877, "home_team": {"name": "Hull City", "lineup": [{"name": "Steve Harper", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Chester", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Dawson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paul McShane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [57]}, {"name": "Ahmed Elmohamady", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jake Livermore", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [57]}, {"name": "Tom Huddlestone", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stephen Quinn", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robbie Brady", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dame N'Doye", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sone Aluko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [66]}], "subs": [{"name": "Allan McGregor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Liam Rosenior", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex Bruce", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Meyler", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [57], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Abel Hernandez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [66], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nikica Jelavic", "yellows": [67], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [57], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andrew Robertson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Burnley", "lineup": [{"name": "Tom Heaton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kieran Trippier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Duff", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jason Shackell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Mee", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "George Boyd", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Scott Arfield", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Jones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matthew Taylor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [76]}, {"name": "Danny Ings", "yellows": [79], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [62], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [88]}, {"name": "Ashley Barnes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Sam Vokes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Kightly", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lukas Jutkiewicz", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fredrik Ulvestad", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matthew Gilks", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stephen Ward", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [76], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Keane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [88], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Burnley produced a goal at long last and then a fighting victory, but it was all too late and relegation was confirmed by Leicester’s result against Southampton. The visitors’ first goal since the one that beat Manchester City in mid-March was enough to see off an anaemic-looking Hull, who badly needed a result here to allay relegation worries of their own. They never looked like getting one, barely showing any fight even when behind, and fell into the bottom three as a result with Tottenham and Manchester United their remaining opponents.\n\nThe possibility now exists that both these teams will end up in the Championship next season, which is more or less what the east Lancashire fans spent the afternoon telling their counterparts from East Yorkshire.\n\n“No regrets. We have learned a lot this season and we have to keep moving forward,” Sean Dyche said. “There is disappointment. We all want to stay in the Premier League, but we gave it a good go.”\n\nThat is more than Steve Bruce was able to say of his players. “We didn’t perform. We were nowhere near the level we should be in all departments,” the Hull manager said. “Every time we come to a game we are expected to win we seem to struggle and now we have made life very hard for ourselves.”\n\nHull had marginally the better chances in a nervy and undistinguished first half, though that is not saying a great deal. Burnley struggled to contain Stephen Quinn and Robbie Brady, who interchanged neatly on the left wing without managing to put in a telling final ball. When Brady did get a decent cross in midway through the first half it found Ahmed Elmohamady in space at the far post, only for the winger to fail to keep his header on target. Brady also hit the bar with a free-kick from 25 yards out 10 minutes before the interval, by which point it appeared set pieces might be the best route to goal for both sides.\n\nBurnley hardly threatened at all for the first half-hour, then Ashley Barnes had two opportunities for headers in quick succession. Stephen Harper made a comfortable save from the second, but Barnes really should have done better with the first, heading over the bar from the six-yard line when Graham Jones’s corner found him unmarked.\n\nThe travelling fans at least appeared ready to accept their fate cheerfully. “You’re going down with the Burnley,” they chanted while the game was still scoreless, as yet another Hull attack broke down on the edge of the area. Sunderland’s win at Everton in the early kick-off had put another struggling side out of Burnley’s reach and though the matter will not be put to the test Dyche and his players must have been aware as they surveyed the half-time scores that even nine points from their last three games would not guarantee survival.\n\nTom Huddlestone saw a shot saved at the start of the second half as Hull began to show a little more urgency, before Barnes went close, just not close enough, to getting a decisive touch to a Matty Taylor cross at the other end. Danny Ings beat James Chester to make a determined run into the box a couple of minutes later, creating a promising shooting chance but going to ground in search of a penalty that never came.\n\nBruce decided he needed to be more proactive after an hour, sending on Nikica Jelavic at the expense of Paul McShane, a central defender. That might have cost Hull, for having reverted to a back four Michael Dawson was off the field receiving attention to a facial injury when Ings put Burnley in front.\n\nGeorge Boyd, formerly of Hull, stopped a ball going dead and surprisingly stayed onside, and with the depleted defence expecting a whistle his cross was not dealt with quickly enough to prevent Ings joining in the pinball and beating Harper with a firmly struck shot. The Burnley fans repeated their relegation chorus, just to show they were not naïve enough to imagine celebrations were in order, before adding an amusing “How crap must you be, we’ve just scored a goal?” for good measure.\n\nBruce decided another striker might now be necessary and replaced Sone Aluko with Abel Hernández, who immediately brought a save from Tom Heaton with an unconventional backheel. There was little else he could have done, standing over the ball with his back to goal a couple of yards out, but Heaton did well to read his intentions and hold the effort on the line.\n\nThe goalkeeper did not get anywhere near as close to Hull’s next effort, another solidly struck free-kick from Brady that again smacked his crossbar. Hull were not exactly unlucky, they simply did not create enough from open play to deserve anything from the game, though Brady could hardly have come any closer to scoring. The home side left the field to muted boos. Muted in part because many Hull fans had already begun to head for the exits."}, {"date": "09/05/2015", "arena": "The King Power Stadium", "attendance": 31939, "home_team": {"name": "Leicester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Kasper Schmeichel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marcin Wasilewski", "yellows": [81], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robert Huth", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wes Morgan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marc Albrighton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matthew James", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [13]}, {"name": "Esteban Cambiasso", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jeffrey Schlupp", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Riyad Mahrez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [7, 19], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leonardo Ulloa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [78]}, {"name": "Jamie Vardy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [70]}], "subs": [{"name": "Ritchie de Laet", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paul Konchesky", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Drinkwater", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [13], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dean Hammond", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [78], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mark Schwarzer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Nugent", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [70], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andrej Kramaric", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Southampton", "lineup": [{"name": "Paulo Gazzaniga", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathaniel Clyne", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "José Fonte", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Toby Alderweireld", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Bertrand", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harrison Reed", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Wanyama", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Davis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [66]}, {"name": "Sadio Mané", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eljero Elia", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [66]}, {"name": "Graziano Pellè", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Kelvin Davis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Maya Yoshida", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Florin Gardos", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shane Long", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [66], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Filip Djuricic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [66], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matt Targett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sam Gallagher", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Nigel Pearson is taking the National Three Peaks Challenge next Sunday but his Leicester City side may have already conquered the biggest mountain on their horizon by then: Premier League survival. With a trip to Sunderland looming large next Saturday, the Leicester manager could be planting flags at the top of Ben Nevis, Scafell Pike and Snowdon with the club’s own top-grade status assured.\n\nWho would have thought that two months ago, before this incredible run of six wins in seven games? Yet this sequence has been necessary and, on 37 points, Leicester still have work to do. “It’s been tough,” Pearson said, “when you think of this pretty unthinkable set of results, in terms of our season overall, we’ve needed them. When you look at the wins the other teams in the relegation battle have achieved, it’s amazing.\n\n“Our players have shown a lot of determination and quality but we need to show it again in the last two games because the sides we’re facing are teams still involved in the relegation battle. We were not at our best today but we showed a lot of discipline when we didn’t have the ball.”\n\n“We are staying up” rang around the King Power Stadium at the end of this latest triumph that came courtesy of two goals from Riyad Mahrez in the opening 20 minutes accompanied by a fourth clean sheet in five games. With Queens Park Rangers due here on the last day of the season, Leicester look all but safe. It will have been one hell of a climb.\n\nIf Southampton’s performance in the opening 20 minutes suggested they were on the beach, Leicester were in paradise. With Pearson able to field an unchanged starting lineup from last Saturday’s 3-0 dismissal of Newcastle United, Tom Meighan and Serge from Kasabian joined Steve Walsh, a veteran of Martin O’Neill’s 1990s Filbert Street gang, on the pitch beforehand to ramp up the atmosphere and it was no surprise when Leicester went ahead.\n\nIf they could have chosen their opponents, Southampton would have been a contender. With one point from six away games, Ronald Koeman’s cultured side seem to be making a bid to drop out of the Europa League placings.\n\nWith Mahrez playing in the hole behind a dynamic front two, Leicester’s urgency again reaped early rewards. The Algerian collected the ball centrally and shaped to go out to the left. Instead, he cut back inside Steven Davis and from 20 yards drilled a crisp left-footed shot into the bottom corner of Paulo Gazzaniga’s net.\n\nNot even a nasty-looking knee injury to Matty James could dampen Leicester’s bite for the fight. When Leonardo Ulloa flicked on a return header for Jamie Vardy to reach down the inside-left channel, the ensuing cross found Mahrez in unexpected space at the near post. He stabbed home his shot, left-footed, with ease, even if Gazzaniga got a hand on the ball.\n\nFor the rest of the game, Leicester were content to sit deep, clear their lines in rudimentary fashion and allow Southampton the lion’s share of possession; or should that be the mouse’s share? Although Sadio Mané headed over from close range halfway through the first half, and dispatched a 25-yard lob that Kasper Schmeichel did well to tip over midway through the second, the truth was that Southampton were in a lower gear. They simply had less at stake and it showed. Rarely can 70% of possession have delivered so little.\n\n“It’s difficult to explain,” Koeman said. “Leicester are full of confidence, they are fighting against relegation, fighting for their life and it makes them difficult to beat. Today they showed good quality, good organisation and unbelievable spirit.”\n\nMahrez sent Vardy galloping between Southampton’s two central defenders with ease but the No9’s shot was saved by Gazzaniga’s legs. Schmeichel tipped over Toby Alderweireld’s free-kick from distance just before half-time but Leicester deserved their advantage.\n\nIncreasingly, they defended with a five-man back line, with two anchormen just in front, relying on breakaways through the pace of Vardy or the ingenuity of David Nugent when he came on. They had already done more than enough. Pearson has just earned Leicester’s first top-flight manager of the month award for 15 years. Is he now a contender for manager of the year?"}, {"date": "09/05/2015", "arena": "St James' Park, Newcastle", "attendance": 47894, "home_team": {"name": "Newcastle United", "lineup": [{"name": "Tim

something to celebrate.\n\nAt least it marked the end of a ghastly eight-game losing streak that had threatened to sweep John Carver’s makeshift team into the Championship. That danger has not quite passed but there were sufficient signs of improvement to suggest that the St James’ Park board might just escape punishment for this season’s concerted cost and corner cutting.\n\nAn amalgam of Hull’s debilitating defeat to Burnley and apparently “kind” closing fixtures at QPR next week and here against West Ham in a fortnight’s time have provoked cautious optimism on Gallowgate.\n\n“Newcastle had more of the possession and more of the play,” said Tony Pulis, whose West Brom players frequently threatened at set pieces but looked happy to settle for the point which offers a mathematical guarantee of Premier League football next season.\n\n“I’m absolutely delighted,” said Pulis who has overseen the collection of 24 points in 17 games since being parachuted in to rescue the club from relegation. “In lots of respects it’s the toughest job I’ve had. I’ve had more stressful days and nights than anywhere else.”\n\nIt is still safe to assume Carver would happily have swapped places with him this spring – and never more readily than in the past week during which he has variously been threatened with replacement by Steve McClaren, quelled a dressing-room mutiny and been widely ridiculed in the national media.\n\nIf only Carver had a point for every time he has issued reminders that defending dead balls represents Newcastle’s “achilles heels”. When West Brom became merely the latest in a litany of sides to highlight this vulnerability it probably hurt Alan Pardew’s successor more than usual as, until then, his team had impressed.\n\nA combination of effort, energy and enterprise, Newcastle began brightly enough for Pulis to experience several apoplectic technical area moments. Then Jonás Gutiérrez hacked down Craig Dawson and Craig Gardner stepped forward to take the resultant dead ball. The former Sunderland midfielder is a free-kick specialist and his latest delivery did not disappoint. With its trajectory thoroughly confounding a makeshift home defence, Victor Anichebe was able to guide a superb header beyond Tim Krul.\n\nHow Carver must have rued the events of a few minutes earlier. None too shabby at set piece dispatch himself, Ryan Taylor had whipped in a free-kick which Fabricio Coloccini headed on. It fell for Moussa Sissoko and, having ridden one challenge, he unleashed a shot only to see it cleared off the line by Joleon Lescott.\n\nIf Sissoko’s powerful, pace suffused surges from deep were worrying a formidably imposing visiting backline, comprised of four tall central defenders, it was another Taylor free-kick which finally bisected that rearguard.\n\nWhether slightly miscued or a supreme piece of skill it looped up kindly for Ayoze Pérez to beat Boaz Myhill with a left-footed half volley angled low into the bottom.\n\nAnother half volley, from Gardner this time, briefly threatened to restore West Brom’s lead early in the second half before swerving off target. Not for the first time though Carver’s defence had been caught cold by Darren Fletcher’s cross.\n\nNewcastle subsequently lived dangerous when Chris Brunt first saw a header blocked by Paul Dummett before volleying the rebound against the bar and, again, as Tim Krul saved smartly from Saido Berahino.\n\nYet with Taylor making a decent job of anchoring things at the base of Carver’s slightly unorthodox midfield diamond, they remained the slightly superior side. If the sight of Papiss Cissé stepping off the bench to make a dual return from a seven match suspension and knee surgery lifted the Tyneside mood, so, too, did Pulis’s decision to replace the excellent Anichebe with Callum McManaman.\n\nAnichebe had been West Brom’s best player and Coloccini particularly looked delighted to see him leave. Greater relief was writ large on James Morrison’s face after his studs-up tackle on Taylor as Chris Foy produced a yellow rather than a red card.\n\nIt only reinforced the sense Newcastle merited victory and they would have secured it had Myhill not reacted well to save Sissoko’s late low drive.\n\nSurvival often hinges on similarly fine margins but the point Newcastle did gain probably represents a significant step towards safety."}, {"date": "09/05/2015", "arena": "Bet365 Stadium", "attendance": 27104, "home_team": {"name": "Stoke City", "lineup": [{"name": "Jack Butland",

"Maybe Tottenham are trying to avoid the Europa League this season? It certainly looks like it. They barely raised a whimper to stop Stoke equalling their record points haul in the Premier League and their manager, Mauricio Pochettino, admitted they were desperately poor.\n\nThe Europa League is a draining, unwanted competition and Spurs, despite their efforts here, are heading for another season in it. This was their 55th game of the season – 10 of those have been spread across the continent – and they looked tired and uninterested.\n\nGoals from Charlie Adam, Steven Nzonzi and Mame Diouf embarrassed Spurs, who were left with 10 men from the 51st minute when Vlad Chiriches was sent off for his second offence. But it made no matter whether there were 10 or 11 men out there, Spurs were dreadful and never in a one-sided game.\n\n“We were poor from the beginning. We were better in the second half with 10 players,” said Pochettino “We are disappointed for our supporters and for our club. The way we lost the game shows that we need to be stronger, to be ready to compete. In the first half we did not compete. This was the problem.”\n\nThe crowd showed more passion with prolonged applause after 15 minutes for the Tottenham legend Jimmy Greaves, who is making a cautious recovery following a severe stroke.\n\nThe win took Stoke to 50 points, equal to last season, with two games to go to improve their best. They attacked from the kick-off, looking to examine Tottenham’s attitude, and they liked what they saw. Spurs were behind after 21 minutes and barely had anything to say throughout the game.\n\nHarry Kane might be Mr Goals for Spurs this season, but Adam has also been prolific lately, with four in his past six games. The Tottenham defender Jan Vertonghen failed to head away a cross, sending the ball up and behind him, and there was Adam to head in near the back post. “A headed goal from Charlie? That’s very rare in itself,” said a smiling Mark Hughes. “But Adam played really well. This was such a good performance when our man of the match could have come from any of a number of contenders.”\n\nWhen Spurs needed a bit of luck soon after Adam’s goal, they did not get it. Erik Lamela’s cross was headed up, Vertonghen-like, by Muniesa and looked like being an own goal until the Stoke keeper, Jack Butland, stretched and guided the ball over the bar.\n\nJust when the 2,000 Spurs fans thought their team might be rousing themselves to make a fight of it, they were let down again. Lloris and Eric Dier tried to deal with Diouf’s cross, neither of them did, and Nzonzi was able to roll in a gift of a goal.\n\nMarko Arnautovic, a constant attacking threat, brought a good save from Lloris just before half time but it was all over when Chiriches – who had looked vulnerable since his booking for a foul on Jon Walters in the 16th minute – brought down Diouf and had to go.\n\n“The sending off of Chiriches is no excuse,” said Pochettino. “We have to be better. We made mistakes for the two goals,we are very disappointed for that. In the second half with ten players weshowed spirit but it was too late.”\n\nJust before the end Arnautovic made yet another run to set up Diouf to toe-poke in Stoke’s third.

"When it was all said and done, and Manchester United are now so nearly there in terms of Champions League qualification, Louis van Gaal’s post-match soundbite cut to the heart of the matter. “Football is crazy,” the United manager said.\n\nThis was an outlandish result for his team, chiselled from a performance so sub-standard that for large swathes of the second half, it was difficult to believe that here before our eyes were the 20-time champions of English football. Or, even, the fourth best team of this season’s Premier League.\n\nAfter the Crystal Palace substitute Jason Puncheon had cancelled out Juan Mata’s first-half penalty with a free-kick that deflected in off Daley Blind as the United midfielder shielded his eyes from the sun, the home team sensed blood. United’s vulnerabilities were alarmingly clear, particularly with the captain, Wayne Rooney, having been forced off with a dead leg at half-time.\n\nVan Gaal’s team groped for direction and leadership, and the errors pock-marked their play. Chris Smalling made some of the most glaring but the centre-half was not alone. United were clinging on after Puncheon’s equaliser and, not for the first time, they were indebted to the reflexes of David de Gea, whose headline moment was the stunning save to deny Glenn Murray at close quarters on 71 minutes.\n\nApart from a couple of bursts from Ashley Young, United offered nothing as an attacking force in the second half and yet they staged the smash-and-grab with Marouane Fellaini’s seventh goal of the season. Even that came coated in good fortune. Following Young’s cross from the left, the United substitute, Radamel Falcao, shoved Damien Delaney into Julián Speroni, which scrambled the Palace goalkeeper and allowed Fellaini to head home.\n\nVan Gaal could not explain it all, and he did not attempt to do so. “When you see how we have played against Chelsea, Everton and West Bromwich Albion [in the previous three games, each of which was lost] and you compare it with today – this was not our best match,” Van Gaal said. “But you win and that is also the beauty of football. What I have seen today is the fighting spirit of my team. I said to the players: ‘When you fight like that, you are difficult to beat.’”\n\nUnited now need only two more points from their final two matches to ensure a top-four finish and they might not even need that, if Liverpool were to slip in any of their remaining three games, the next of which is at Chelsea on Sunday.\n\n“This result brings us a big step closer to our goal and I shall sit with a fantastic glass of wine to see the match, Chelsea against Liverpool,” Van Gaal said. Would he toast a Chelsea result with champagne? “When I don’t drink too much red wine, then maybe,” he replied, with a smile.\n\nAlan Pardew looked bemused and a little shocked at how his Palace team had emerged with nothing, and the manager’s complaints centred on two penalty controversies. He felt that Scott Dann should not have been penalised for leading with his right biceps on Young’s cross, which was a tough sell, as the award for handball looked to be sound. Mata converted his 10th goal of the season to end United’s goal drought at 305 minutes.\n\nBut Pardew was on safer ground with his gripe about the referee Michael Oliver’s non-award of a penalty in the 53rd minute. Puncheon jinked back inside the area; he felt Mata catch his standing foot and down he went. It was not a natural fall but, equally, there was contact from Mata.\n\nThe temperature went up and, with United looking uncertain, it was no surprise when Puncheon fashioned the equaliser, after Smalling had conceded a free-kick 25 yards from goal.\n\nUnited had lost Luke Shaw on 39 minutes after he copped an accidental elbow in the face from James McArthur; Rooney could not continue after the interval and Smalling, too, seemed to have a knock. Van Gaal was asked what it was. “He was stumbling [around] and I don’t think he played his best match, so that’s why I substituted him,” Van Gaal replied. He did go on to say that his hapless player had some cramp.\n\nBlind had hit the post from distance early on, while Ander Herrera fluffed a 22nd-minute volley, but Palace, too, had their moments in the first half, with Mile Jedinak heading narrowly off target and Murray just failing to convert after a well-worked free-kick.\n\nPalace turned the screw after the equaliser and, for a dismal 20-minute period, United trembled. Smalling was caught in possession, leading to McArthur prodding inches wide and then the big chance, when Dann teed up Murray, six yards out. The striker went for the deft chip but De Gea threw out an arm to save. It was a priceless moment from the United player of the season and it felt even more so when Fellaini plundered the winner. There was still time for De Gea to save with his legs from Murray.

and movement by Santi Cazorla and two more goals from Alexis Sánchez were sufficient to ensure an imperious Arsenal headed back to London confident of returning to the Champions League next season.\n\nThe gap in goal difference is such that it is vitually impossible for fifth-placed Liverpool to catch Arsène Wenger’s team now but, unfortunately for Steve Bruce, the possibility of Hull dropping into the Championship remains far from theoretical.\n\nArsène Wenger challenges Arsenal to give Chelsea a fight next season Read more\n\nThird-from-bottom Sunderland are only a point behind his 17th-placed side, awkward fixtures lie ahead and the momentum gained during a recent mini-rival could be in danger of fizzling out.\n\nIn mitigation Bruce did not exaggerate when he described Arsenal’s football as “fabulous”. Fantastically fluid with constantly interchanging positional rotation and devastatingly rapid counter-attacks, Wenger’s side would have beaten many better teams than Hull.\n\n“When Arsenal play like that they’re as good as anyone in Europe,” said Bruce. “It was one of those difficult evenings – and a truly awful 15 minutes before half-time – for us. We didn’t match our standard of the last couple of games and we didn’t have any luck. Two of the goals were cruel deflections and, if you chase the game, Arsenal can really open you up.”\n\nArsenal offered a foretaste of dominance to come by, rather rudely, hogging possession for the entire opening two minutes. A nonchalant backheel from the impressive Aaron Ramsey underlined this early superiority but then Jake Livermore crunched in on Sánchez with a wince-inducing challenge and Hull were up and running.\n\nWhen James Chester hoisted a long dropping ball out of defence Dame N’Doye rushed to meet it, forcing David Ospina to race off his line and head clear from the edge of his box.\n\nAs Arsenal learnt during last season’s FA Cup final win, Hull can be troublesome opponents and so, albeit deceptively, it was proving here with Sánchez, Mesut Özil and a deep-lying Cazorla initially struggling to conjure telling final passes.\n\nIt did not deter their supporters from indulging in a brief bout of “going down” after Tom Huddlestone met a Héctor Bellerín cross with a heel and flicked it in a looping arc towards his own goal. Fortunately for Huddlestone the ball’s trajectory allowed Steve Harper a routine save. Sone Aluko soon experienced embarrassment of his own after Robbie Brady’s whipped-in cross confounded Wenger’s defence and the striker was offered a free header. Somehow failing to make proper contact with the ball, Aluko missed a highly inviting chance. It was the sort of moment which, when the music stops and relegation is confirmed or averted, can be seen as defining.\n\nIt certainly proved costly here because shortly afterwards Arsenal took the lead. It began with Huddlestone – looking a shadow of last season’s assured midfield choreographer – being caught loitering in possession by Özil. Having pinched the ball he picked out Sánchez whose advance was brought to an abrupt end by Livermore’s tackle.\n\nSanchez stepped forward and aimed to lift the ensuing free-kick over the wall. Helpfully it took a deflection off Michael Dawson, wrong-footing Harper and allowing the forward to celebrate his 15th Premier League goal of the campaign.\n\nFinally able to relax slightly, Arsenal began finding their passing range and a wonderful delivery from Cazorla bisected two defenders, enabling Ramsey to turn and shoot. Brady attempted a last-ditch tackle but instead of rescuing the situation the ball instead deflected off him, once again wrong-footing Harper.\n\nWith Cazorla particularly contributing some lovely cameos the travelling fans were singing “Boring, boring Chelsea”. As Cazorla and company increasingly invested their passing with the sort of beautiful geometry capable of thoroughly bewildering the initially impressive Dawson and friends, Bruce hung his head.\n\nEven more ominously the game was proving far too slick and speedy for Huddlestone who was caught dwelling on the ball once more by Ramsey and summarily dispossessed. Ramsey’s incisive pass enabled the accelerating Sánchez to round poor Harper and shoot his second goal and Arsenal’s 100th of the season.\n\nCesc Fàbregas: Chelsea title may herald new Mourinho era of success Read more\n\nThere was a distinct exhibition-mode feel to a second half highlighted for Arsenal by Jack Wilshere stepping off the visiting bench to make a long-awaited return from injury, while his team missed assorted chances.\n\nAt least a second-half improvement in which Hull reduced the deficit bodes well for their final three fixtures at home to Burnley and Manchester United and away to Tottenham. Ahmed Elmohamady dispatched some fine crosses from right wing-back and a typically well-weighted delivery led to Stephen Quinn heading past Ospina. A couple of minutes later an unexpected fightback gathered pace as Elmohamady crossed again and Paul McShane headed narrowly over.\n\nYet despite further valiance from the excellent David Meyler, influential after replacing Livermore for the second half when he showed Francis Coquelin that he too knows a bit about the art of enforcement, it was very much Arsenal’s night.\n\n“We’ll have to dust ourselves down and get ready for Burnley,” said Bruce. “After that the future could look a whole lot brighter.”"}, {"date": "03/05/2015", "arena": "Stamford Bridge", "attendance": 41566, "home_team":

Hazard flitted around dangerously and Fàbregas was never long off the ball.\n\nThey always kept half-a-dozen players behind the ball to protect themselves against the speed of Palace’s counter-attacking players and Mourinho’s substitutions late on told their own story. Kurt Zouma was brought on for Willian and Filipe Luís was introduced to replace Hazard. Chelsea ended up with six defenders on the pitch, two of them playing in midfield, and nothing else on their minds but to suffocate the game in its final moments. “Today was not a game to enjoy,” Mourinho said matter-of-factly. “Today was a day to finish the job.”\n\nNo doubt they will face more accusations of not winning thrillingly enough but do not presume that will bother Mourinho. “I think everyone knows we deserve this,” he said. “It’s just that some don’t say it.”\n\nChelsea’s 2014-15 Premier League title-winning squad: how they rate | Dominic Fifield Read more\n\nHis late changes also recognised the fact they were confronted by difficult opponents. Wilfried Zaha caused problems all afternoon and Palace matched their opponents until that moment a minute before half-time when Hazard played a one-two with Willian, darted between James McArthur and Adrian Mariappa and won a penalty that Alan Pardew summed up as a “nice piece of luck”. If Hazard was clipped it was mostly because he initiated the contact himself, already in midair. What looked a penalty at full speed looked considerably less so in slow motion.\n\n\n\nHazard’s penalty was struck so poorly that Speroni, having got his hands to the ball, might have made a better job of holding on to it. Instead the rebound popped up invitingly for Hazard to brace his neck muscles and score at the second attempt, showing great composure for someone who is hardly renowned for his heading ability.\n\nChelsea had not offered a great deal until that point other than a dipping free-kick from Didier Drogba that Speroni clawed away at the second attempt and a shot from Nemanja Matic towards the near post. Drogba and Willian had decent chances to soothe any lingering nerves in the second half but Chelsea always maintained a calculated measure of caution.\n\nJosé Mourinho must feel this is a special achievement even by his standards | Barney Ronay Read more\n\nMourinho’s first substitution had come at half-time, when he took off Juan Cuadrado and brought on Mikel John Obi to add more muscle and presence alongside Matic. Terry and Gary Cahill headed away just about everything and César Azpilicueta got tight to Zaha. “It’s what champions do,” Pardew said. “They don’t let you back in when they get the lead.”\n\n\n\nCuadrado had been thrust into the team after Ramires pulled out in the warm-up, feeling so unwell he was taken to hospital, but the £27m signing from Fiorentina has looked lost in his brief time at Chelsea and his struggles were in keeping with an occasionally laboured first half from Mourinho’s team. Terry’s sprawling block to turn away Jason Puncheon’s shot was also worthy of scrutiny given that the ball struck both his midriff and arm. Terry maybe deserves the benefit of the doubt after some exceptional defending to get his body in the way and the Chelsea captain was superb in the second half as Pardew’s team continued to attack with width and pace.\n\nUnfortunately for Palace Yannick Bolasie’s element of surprise did not often catch out his opponents.\n\nMourinho looked tired in his press conference after a week in which he has also flown to Portugal because his father was having an operation. At the final whistle his first reaction was to go into the seats behind the dugout to find his family. But the man who is averaging a trophy every 34 games still managed to get the last word. This one came in the form of an old Portuguese saying – “Os cães ladram, mas a caravana passa”. It translates as dogs bark but the caravan keeps on.\n\nIt means to pay no attention to what people say – good advice when the Premier League trophy is on it way back to Stamford Bridge."}, {"date": "03/05/2015", "arena": "White Hart Lane", "attendance": 35784, "home_team": {"name": "Tottenham Hotspur", "lineup": [{"name": "Hugo Lloris", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eric Dier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Federico Fazio", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jan Vertonghen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Rose", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nabil Bentaleb", "yellows": [42], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Mason", "yellows": [45], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [70]}, {"name": "Erik Lamela", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Eriksen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [59]}, {"name": "Nacer Chadli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [84]}, {"name": "Harry Kane", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Vlad Chiriches", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paulinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [70], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Roberto Soldado", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [59], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Emmanuel Adebayor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [84], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "DeAndre Yedlin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michel Vorm", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Benjamin Stambouli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Manchester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Joe Hart", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pablo Zabaleta", "yellows": [68], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martín Demichelis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eliaquim Mangala", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aleksandar Kolarov", "yellows": [74], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fernando", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fernandinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Milner", "yellows": [41], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Frank Lampard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [73]}, {"name": "David Silva", "yellows": [82], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sergio Agüero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [29], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [89]}], "subs": [{"name": "Bacary Sagna", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Samir Nasri", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [73], "sub_off": [76]}, {"name": "Edin Dzeko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willy Caballero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wilfried Bony", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [76], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gael Clichy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dedryck Boyata", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [89], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Manuel Pellegrini might wish that he could play Tottenham Hotspur every week. And so might Sergio Agüero. The Manchester City manager has now won four out of four against Tottenham and Agüero continues to excel against them.\n\nThis was by no means as comfortable as Pellegrini’s previous victories over the north London club, which were marked by a glut of goals, but the common denominator was the identity of the star turn. Agüero was not perfect but enough of what he did was close to it, particularly during a rampant first-half performance in which he scored the decisive goal.\n\nAgüero took a cute pass from David Silva following a rapier-like counter to blast high into Hugo Lloris’ near corner. Under Pellegrini, he has eight goals in four matches against Spurs while, in total, he has 10 in seven – his highest Premier League return against a single opponent.\n\nCity had seen Chelsea secure the title earlier with the 1-0 home win over Crystal Palace but they remain determined to finish he seasonas the runners-up. They got the job done here to end a damaging run of five consecutive away defeats but it spoke volumes that the goalkeeper, Joe Hart, ran Agüero close for the man of the match award.\n\nMauricio Pochettino cursed Tottenham’s wastefulness in front of goal and a draw would not have been unfair but Hart made a clutch of important saves, most notably blocks from Ryan Mason and Harry Kane, and the injury-time reaction stop to keep out Érik Lamela’s acrobatic volley.\n\nIt was an entertaining game, heavy on incident, and Pellegrini said, rather pointedly, in light of the criticism of Chelsea’s style, that it was “important for the Premier League and for the fans to play attractive football”.\n\nHe added: “Tottenham play attractive football and so do we. That’s why we saw an attractive game. Chelsea did exactly what we did last season, winning the Premier League and the Capital One Cup. We did it by scoring more goals and by playing in a different style. We scored 156 goals; 102 in the league. And we continue to be the top scorers [this season].”\n\nThis game ought to have been shaped differently, with Tottenham spurning three gilt-edged chances in the opening three minutes. Nacer Chadli failed to pick out the unmarked Lamela in the middle on the break – Aleksandar Kolarov’s block was important – and Eric Dier headed wide from Lamela’s corner. In the next attack, Lamela put Kane through but he dragged wide.\n\nCity, though, did not take long to advertise their threat and time and again it came from Agüero. By the end of the first half Tottenham’s defenders had been spooked by him. His pace and powerful running were a lethal combination.\n\nThere was controversy on 22 minutes when, after a long punt forward and a slip from Lloris, Agüero felt that he was tripped in the area by Federico Fazio. But his frustration was short-lived. The move for his goal originated from a Tottenham corner, with Silva’s work impressive and the finish unstoppable.\n\nFernandinho twice went close for City in the first half while Agüero worked Lloris after a breathtaking trick inside the area. Mason’s chance on 45 minutes was glorious but Hart was out quickly to block.\n\nTottenham have found themselves in a weird situation, given that there is little appetite from their management to finish in the Europa League places. But they have their professional pride and they chased the equaliser, with Pochettino throwing on Roberto Soldado and, towards the end, Emmanuel Adebayor.\n\nThe second half featured fewer chances but they were nonetheless presentable. Kane robbed Martín Demichelis only for Hart to crowd him out and block while Agüero took Fernandinho’s cross around Lloris but, off-balance, he could not finish. Kolarov also tested Lloris from long-range.\n\nThe home crowd revelled in the misfortune of the City substitute and the former Arsenal midfielder Samir Nasri, who was forced off with a muscle pull three minutes after coming on, and the home team caught a break in the 79th minute when the referee did not penalise Danny Rose for a lunge on Pablo Zabaleta inside the area, in which he got none of the ball and some of the man. Soldado saw a shot blocked while Hart denied the substitute, Paulinho, and, at the very end, Lamela.\n\nMan of the Match Sergio Agüero (Manchester City)"}, {"date": "02/05/2015", "arena": "The King Power Stadium", "attendance": 31576, "home_team": {"name": "Leicester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Kasper Schmeichel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marcin Wasilewski", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [68]}, {"name": "Robert Huth", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wes Morgan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [17], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marc Albrighton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matthew James", "yellows": [29], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Esteban Cambiasso", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [74]}, {"name": "Jeffrey Schlupp", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Riyad Mahrez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jamie Vardy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leonardo Ulloa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [1, 48], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [78]}], "subs": [{"name": "Ritchie de Laet", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [68], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paul Konchesky", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Drinkwater", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dean Hammond", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [74], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mark Schwarzer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Wood", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andrej Kramaric", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [78], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Newcastle United", "lineup": [{"name": "Tim Krul", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daryl Janmaat", "yellows": [16], "reds": [90], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mike Williamson", "yellows": [55], "reds": [62], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fabricio Coloccini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paul Dummett", "yellows": [70], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Colback", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Taylor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [58]}, {"name": "Jonás Gutiérrez", "yellows": [28], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Moussa Sissoko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ayoze Pérez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [74]}, {"name": "Emmanuel Riviere", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [64]}], "subs": [{"name": "Vurnon Anita", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [64], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Siem de Jong", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [58], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rémy Cabella", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sammy Ameobi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mehdi Abeid", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Armstrong", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [74], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Freddie Woodman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Forget about ostriches, fear for these flightless Magpies. Newcastle fans had to bury their heads in their hands again as their team flopped to an eighth consecutive defeat. They are falling fast towards the relegation zone while teams below are sprouting wings, none more so than Leicester, whose late-season surge continued here thanks to two goals from Leonardo Ulloa, one by Wes Morgan, and the wretchedness of a Newcastle side that finished with nine men and were accused of cowardice by their own manager.\n\nA month ago Newcastle seemed comfortable in mid-table, 17 points above the then bottom-placed Leicester. Now the gap between the clubs is a single point and the difference in momentum and mood could not be more stark. While Leicester fans generated a giddy din that can only have uplifted the home players – and the manager, Nigel Pearson, who was serenaded from early on and responded with an appreciative wave – those in the away end heaved with despair for their club and contempt for its owner, Mike Ashley.\n\nOn the pitch, Newcastle’s players could not have made a worse start if they had tried. They lost possession within three seconds of kicking off, conceded a corner after 24 seconds and fell behind after just 36.\n\nLeicester, exuding the speed and directness that have characterised their revival, took full advantage of such lightning-fast ineptitude. From Marc Albrighton’s first-minute corner, Ulloa held off Moussa Sissoko, whose return from suspension was supposed to reinforce Newcastle, and headed into the net from six yards.\n\nNewcastle attempted to respond and Ayoze Pérez flashed a dangerous shot across goal in the sixth minute after a cute pass from Daryl Janmaat. But Leicester, by far the more energetic and coherent side, responded with a diving header from Ulloa and a snapshot on the turn by Jamie Vardy, both of which were saved by Tim Krul.\n\nNewcastle’s flimsy resistance soon broke again as, on 17 minutes, Janmaat clunked into Jeff Schlupp to give away a free-kick on the left. Albrighton produced another lovely delivery and Morgan sent a free header into the net from eight yards as Newcastle appealed in vain for offside.\n\nA cosy two-goal lead allowed Leicester to spend the remainder of the first half sitting back, and occasionally springing forward on the counterattack. Newcastle did hint at threatening but their lack of sharpness was summed up after 33 minutes when Emmanuel Rivière, after opening up the home defence with a fine one-two with Pérez, lost his balance and fell over with only the goalkeeper to beat.\n\nJohn Carver could not contain his rage. “It was the most animated I’ve been in my football career,” he said of his half-time team-talk. “I couldn’t accept what was going on in the first half.”\n\nThe players’ response spoke volumes for the malaise at the club – within three minutes of the resumption they were 3-0 down, Ulloa slamming a penalty into the net after Rivière was punished for an oafish challenge on the Leicester defender Marcin Wasilewski.\n\nLeonardo Ulloa scores the third goal for Leicester against Newcastle in the Premier League at the King Power stadium. Photograph: Alan Walter/Reuters\n\nThere was now no doubt that Newcastle would lose the match, the only question was how much dignity would they lose in the process. Krul, in fairness, did his best to keep up appearances and made a series of fine blocks as Leicester sought to inflict further damage.\n\nHe could not stop Newcastle from inflicting further damage on themselves, however, and the defender Mike Williamson was sent off in the 62nd minute for a wild, late tackle on Vardy after the players pursued a ball off the pitch. “He had no need to make the challenge, now he will miss two games. Is it an easy way out?” wondered Carver, who was also exasperated by Janmaat’s expulsion for a second bookable offence in the last minute.\n\nMeanwhile, everything looks rosy again for Pearson, who was enjoying a relaxing end to an unwelcome week in the spotlight. With his side three goals to the good, he could afford to take off two key players, Wasilewski and Esteban Cambiasso, midway through the second half to preserve them for the battles ahead. “We would be foolish to assume the job’s done,” said Pearson.\n\nHe added that the result helped put all the unpleasantness about his midweek press conference behind him. “I do my job as conscientiously as I can regardless of what happens in this sort of domain,” he said.\n\n“I spoke to the owners before the game and they’re very upbeat about the progress we’re making. It was important to get back to winning ways, that’s more important than any side issue.”\n\nHe was eager, however, to clarify that he had not been forced to apologise to the journalist with whom he clashed but did so voluntarily. “I don’t like the intimation that I’m press-ganged into an apology. I make an apology based on what I think is the right thing to do.\n\n“Football is an emotional game. I’ve been criticised for not being emotional enough, likewise I’ve been criticised for being slightly too emotional. We all learn from what we do in life, whether it’s good or bad.”\n\nThe emotions at Newcastle are all negative at the moment, and they need to figure out fast how to rise above it, or they are going

was Tim Sherwood’s response to Aston Villa’s predicament last weekend and it was easy to see why the manager feels that way after an afternoon when his team’s performance did a much better job of warming the home supporters’ hearts than the bitterly cold weather.\n\nTwo goals from the revitalised Christian Benteke, taking the striker’s tally to 11 in his last nine club matches, and another from the outstanding Tom Cleverley brought Everton’s six-match unbeaten league run to an end and lifted Villa up to 14th place in the table, above Newcastle United on goal difference.\n\nLiverpool 2-1 QPR | Premier League match report Read more\n\nIt was no more than Villa deserved on the balance of play, with Fabian Delph catching the eye alongside Cleverley in front of the watching Roy Hodgson, although there was nearly a sting in the tail when Phil Jagielka pulled a goal back for Everton in injury time.\n\nVilla, however, held on for a victory that appeared even more important in the context of results elsewhere. With only three matches remaining, two of them at home against West Ham United and Burnley, Villa are still only two points clear of the bottom three. Not that Sherwood is paying much attention.\n\n“It was a huge win today but you know what, I’ve drove myself mad ever since I’ve been here looking at the fixtures of other teams and the league table. I’ve got no interest now,” the Villa manager said. “If we don’t do our job we deserve to go down. Everyone is going to win, it’s a freak season, isn’t it?\n\n“Leicester can go and win four in 29 or whatever it was and then they win five in six. It’s enough pressure trying to look after your own team, never mind worrying about everyone else’s results. If we win the games that are available to us … and I think we might need to win them all to stay in the league.”\n\nOn and off the pitch, there is no shortage of entertainment value with Sherwood in charge. Villa have now scored 17 goals in 10 league games since he replaced Paul Lambert and it is hard to reconcile the vibrant, dynamic, attacking football the players are producing now with the toothless, prosaic style of play under his predecessor.\n\nBenteke is a man transformed, Cleverley is playing with a smile on his face again, Jack Grealish is a joy to watch and Delph is running the show. Sherwood cannot get enough of the Villa captain. “I thought Fabian Delph showed why he’s probably, in my opinion, the best midfield player in the country at the moment. I wouldn’t swap him for anyone in the mess we’re in,” he said. “It’s not only about energy and desire, it’s about flair and imagination. He’s got the whole package. I see Roy Hodgson was up there, I think he would have been very impressed with the two midfield players, Cleverley as well.”\n\nAs for Everton, this display felt like something of an anticlimax on the back of their superb victory over Manchester United last Sunday. While the visitors improved in the second half, Roberto Martínez admitted that the damage was done in the opening 45 minutes, when the Everton manager conceded that his team were “second best in everything we did”.\n\nBenteke gave Villa the lead in the 11th minute when he met a splendid Delph centre with a towering header and the Belgian scored his second on the stroke of half-time after some suspect Everton defending. Ron Vlaar flicked on Grealish’s corner – one of several excellent set-pieces from the 19-year-old – and Benteke, totally unmarked, had the simple task of turning the ball home.\n\nWest Ham United 1-0 Burnley | Premier League match report Read more\n\nThe complexion of the game changed when Vlaar brought down Steven Naismith in the area just before the hour mark. Romelu Lukaku made no mistake from the spot, hesitating in his run-up before coolly rolling the ball into the corner for his 19th goal of the season. The anxiety among home fans was tangible but Villa gave themselves some breathing space when Cleverley, running on to Leandro Bacuna’s measured pass, beat Tim Howard with a rising shot from 12 yards.\n\nThat should have been that but Villa endured a nervous finale after James McCarthy’s header came back off the bar and Jagielka nodded in. Shay Given, who was making his first Premier League appearance since August 2012 after Sherwood decided to drop Brad Guzan, earned a booking for protesting that Séamus Coleman fouled him prior to Jagielka scoring. “Fortunately that [decision] hasn’t cost us today but it can on other occasions,” Sherwood said."}, {"date": "02/05/2015", "arena": "Anfield", "attendance": 44707, "home_team":

directed towards the exit by the end. Steven Gerrard dug Liverpool out of a hole, just for old times’ sake, with an 87th-minute winner on his penultimate home appearance. One man’s fairytale ending proved a nightmare for the opposition.\n\n\n\nQPR must avoid defeat at Manchester City next Sunday or they will make an immediate return to the Championship. They lost Steven Caulker to a suspected broken hand at half-time, another defender, Nedum Onuoha, to a needless red card and, not for the first time this season, their concentration late on when Gerrard appeared through a crowded six-yard box to head home Philippe Coutinho’s corner and his 184th goal for Liverpool.\n\nLeicester City 3-0 Newcastle United | Premier League match report Read more\n\nWith Rodgers also defending his tenure, Anfield witnessed an important day in the life of its manager, its indefatigable captain and relegation-threatened opponents. However, as Rodgers eloquently put it, the serious narratives were rendered “insignificant” in comparison to the news that Rio Ferdinand’s wife, Rebecca Ellison, had died of cancer on Friday at the age of 34. Both teams wore black armbands in memory of the mother of three young children and Leroy Fer revealed a T-shirt tribute to the Ferdinand family after equalising Coutinho’s opener.\n\nFer’s 73rd-minute volley gave QPR hope in their bid to avoid the drop. Gerrard offered them more encouragement when his 77th-minute penalty at the Kop end was saved by Robert Green. Ten minutes later he took it away.\n\n“A lot of players when they miss a big penalty their game goes and their confidence goes. Steven is the total opposite,” said the Liverpool manager, who was going to replace the 34-year-old with Lucas Leiva had he converted the spot-kick. “He is one of a unique group of players that when they need to respond, they do, and an outstanding header gets us the win. It is world-class talent.\n\n“The career is all flashing before his eyes now. It was brilliant to get it at the Kop end as well. This is a guy that you cannot replace. He is getting on in age a wee bit but in terms of quality, his sheer quality as a player, there are not many in our team that can rival that. It will probably only be when he is gone that people will recognise what a sheer talent he is.”\n\nAnfield desperately craved another Gerrard goal but it proved an agonising wait with the captain going close with a free-kick from the edge of the penalty area and missing a penalty here for the sixth time in his career before finally delivering.\n\nQPR made a bright, determined start and Fer had the ball in Simon Mignolet’s goal after 47 seconds only for an assistant referee to spot that Matt Phillips’s corner had curled out of play en route. Caulker and Fer also went close before Liverpool started to play with the game 10 minutes old.\n\nWith Mario Balotelli nursing a foot injury and Daniel Sturridge in Boston for an assessment on his hip problem, Rickie Lambert was handed his first start in the Premier League since 6 December. The England international took the rare, arguably overdue, opportunity well and it was his vision that allowed Coutinho to open the scoring. Liverpool broke down their right through Raheem Sterling and found Lambert. The striker picked out Coutinho lurking on the opposite side of the area. The Brazilian cut back inside Onuoha and curled a shot into the top corner.\n\nAdam Lallana and Sterling squandered glorious chances to put the game beyond QPR in the second half and their profligacy was punished when Fer vollied Joey Barton’s corner down the centre of Mignolet’s goal. Dejan Lovren and Martin Skrtel stood watching as he did so.\n\nAston Villa 3-2 Everton | Premier League match report Read more\n\nThen came Onuoha’s self-implosion. With 12 minutes remaining he pulled Skrtel to the ground at a Liverpool corner, to concede the penalty that Gerrard failed to convert, and collected a yellow card into the bargain.\n\nFour minutes later he scythed down the substitute Jordon Ibe and walked before Martin Atkinson could produce the second yellow card.\n\nFurther punishment arrived for Rangers when they failed to track Gerrard’s run to meet Coutinho’s corner and the captain steered a header into Green’s bottom left-hand corner.\n\n“The fans can see that we are not going out with a whimper,” said Chris Ramsey, seemingly resigned to his team’s fate."}, {"date": "02/05/2015", "arena": "Stadium of Light", "attendance": 39613, "home_team": {"name": "Sunderland", "lineup": [{"name": "Costel Pantilimon", "yellows": [],

relegation. Combined with a slightly contentious red card for Southampton’s James Ward-Prowse and another catalytic midfield performance from Lee Cattermole, Gómez’s superbly taken penalties re-acquainted Wearsiders with something called optimism.\n\nSunderland remain third bottom but they are one point behind Leicester and Hull and two in arrears of Newcastle and Aston Villa. Tricky, potentially hazard laden trips to Everton, Arsenal and Chelsea lie ahead but much may hinge on the remaining home game against Leicester.\n\nDick Advocaat was asked if he had “enough in his dressing room” to stay up. The Dutchman smiled broadly. “Yes, definitely,” he said. “I’m there – and 18 players.”\n\nHis cause here was helped by the reality that, until Ward-Prowse’s second-half dismissal, Southampton had done a passable impression of a team day-dreaming about impending summer holidays. Although the red card shocked them into life, their hopes of European qualification received a severe dent.\n\nAs befits two old friends and compatriots Ronald Koeman and Advocaat were all jokes and embraces but the latter had no compunction about quite possibly denying his Southampton counterpart a few continental excursions. “I was really happy when the final whistle went,” the former Holland manager said.\n\nJust before that whistle he must have had his heart in his mouth as Costel Pantilimon made a brilliant reflex save to deny Graziano Pellè what had seemed a certain goal, but Advocaat remained adamant Sunderland merited victory. “It was a real team performance to get a result we deserved. We worked so hard,” he said. “Southampton have a very good side and we had to fight for the points. My team are really knackered now.”\n\nDanny Graham, whose indomitable industry proved emblematic of the wider collective effort, swiftly set the upbeat tone by winning an early penalty. When he and José Fonte challenged for a dropping ball, the Southampton defender raised his boot, catching Graham and sending him crashing to the floor. Gómez stepped forward to take the penalty, evading Kelvin Davis’s reach with a thoroughly assured, kick, directed low into the bottom corner.\n\nAdvocaat’s celebrations proved short-lived. He had barely settled back into his seat before a ghastly defensive communications failure gifted an equaliser.\n\nIt began with Southampton lobbing a speculative ball into the box. Pantilimon came out to make a routine collection but, just in front of him, Sebastian Coates appeared hellbent on trying to head clear.\n\nGoalkeeper and defender duly collided and with John O’Shea further complicating matters by crashing into Coates, the three Sunderland players were left to slowly untangle their limbs from the undignified heap. Sadio Mané pounced, gleefully turning the ball into an unguarded net.\n\nThe start of the second half brought a second penalty for Gómez, his left foot again proving far too accurate for Davis, who dived the wrong way. A move that had been initiated by the impressive, and increasingly influential, Cattermole scything into a challenge and surging upfield, concluded with Graham holding the ball up in the manner of a top class centre-forward before playing in Jermain Defoe. The former England striker’s first touch was not exactly stellar but it did not prevent Ward-Prowse charging in and toppling Defoe.\n\nBereft of malice, the challenge probably merited a yellow card but Mike Jones produced a red, Southampton were down to 10 men and things finally looked to be going Advocaat’s way.\n\nIt served to galvanise Southampton, who beat Sunderland 8-0 in October, prefacing some of their most dangerous passages of play. Advocaat’s attempt to change the narrative involved Adam Johnson coming off the bench in the 81st minute to make his first appearance since being charged with three offences of sexual activity with a 15-year-old girl and one of grooming.\n\nGreeted warmly, the erstwhile England winger made little impact but joined team-mates in congratulating Pantilimon for that wonderful 11th-hour blocking of Pellè’s vicious 10-yard shot that may yet keep Sunderland out of the Championship.\n\nOther visiting managers might have deflected criticism by blaming defeat on the referee but Koeman is better than that. “It’s so easy to talk about refereeing decisions but we made mistakes, we gave them the possibilities to create those situations,” he said. “That was the reason we lost, not the referee. Normally our level is much higher.\n\n“We didn’t reach our level. We were very poor at times and I’m frustrated by that. It’s strange that with a player less on the pitch we showed our quality. Our reaction with one player less made us the better team, the dominating team. It’s hard to understand.\n\n“Sunderland gave everything –Advocaat is an experienced man and a good coach and I think he has given them a little bit extra – but I expect much more from my team.”"},

the battle for eighth place in the Premier League after a first goal in English football for the Ecuador winger Jefferson Montero and a late second from the substitute Ki Sung-yueng settled matters in South Wales.\n\nThe win extends Swansea’s advantage over ninth place to six points with three games of the season remaining and they look on course for their highest Premier League finish. Swansea’s manager, Garry Monk, feels his side have an outside chance of Europe, as they are now only four points adrift of Southampton, surprisingly defeated at Sunderland, and seventh place could be enough for Europa League qualification if Arsenal beat Aston Villa in the FA Cup final at the end of May.\n\n“The carrot [of Europe] is there for us but we have got Arsenal away, Man City home and Crystal Palace away and they are tough games,” said Monk.\n\n“It is feasible to get into Europe but we keep our feet firmly on the ground here. This game was about consolidating our place in the top 10 and we are in control of that eighth spot now. We have beaten our best points tally and you have to find new things to fight for.”\n\nLeicester City 3-0 Newcastle United | Premier League match report Read more\n\nStoke had started the day in ninth spot but they offered precious little in attack and were reduced to 10 men for the first time in the Premier League this season when Marc Wilson tripped Montero five minutes from the end to collect a second yellow card. “The first was a coming together and probably looked more than it was,” said Stoke’s manager, Mark Hughes. “It was a foul but I’m not sure if it was a yellow card.”\n\nSwansea eventually found the fluency which had been missing from their game in a poor first half and dominated the second period. It looked as if they might be denied until Jonjo Shelvey kept the ball in play on the right flank and crossed to the far post where Montero beat Phil Bardsley to score with a diving header.\n\nStoke were a man short by the time one substitute, Modou Barrow, broke free and found Shelvey at the far post, the midfielder pulling the ball back for another replacement, Ki, to score with a firm sidefooted finish.\n\nStoke had started well but the first opportunity still fell to Swansea when Montero crossed to the far post and Nelson Oliveira volleyed into the side netting from an acute angle. Stoke were unable to fashion any chances but they enjoyed a fair share of possession and did a fine job of protecting their goalkeeper Jack Butland, who had replaced Asmir Begovic to make his first Premier League start in 15 months.\n\nThe game finally stirred into some sort of life in the final five minutes of the half after Charlie Adam tried his luck but was off target from 25 yards.\n\nSwansea lost Oliveira to injury and Nathan Dyer teed up Shelvey up for a shot which flew straight at Butland. Stoke instantly replied as Steven Nzonzi forced Lukasz Fabianski to tip over his crossbar and Ryan Shawcross should have done better from the resulting Adam corner when he lost his marker but headed wide.\n\nSwansea needed to raise the tempo at the start of the second period and they were almost immediately rewarded for doing so when Marko Arnautovic slipped to present Àngel Rangel with possession.\n\nThe full-back squared the ball to Gylfi Sigurdsson and the Iceland international rattled the crossbar from 20 yards early in the second half . Sigurdsson had an even clearer sight of goal from Dyer’s centre but he could not keep his header down and Butland waved it over the bar.\n\nSwansea were now firmly in the ascendancy. Shelvey saw his shot blocked before Sigurdsson’s follow-up was deflected wide, but Stoke were unable to hold out in the closing stages after Montero ended their resistance, and Ki’s second made sure."}, {"date": "02/05/2015", "arena": "Upton Park", "attendance": 34946, "home_team": {"name": "West Ham United", "lineup": [{"name": "Adrián", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Carl Jenkinson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Collins", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Reece Burke", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Cresswell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mark Noble", "yellows": [44], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [24], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cheikhou Kouyaté", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stewart Downing", "yellows": [60], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin Nolan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [79]}, {"name": "Morgan Amalfitano", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Enner Valencia", "yellows": [41], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [82]}], "subs": [{"name": "Matthew Jarvis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nene", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [79], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joey O'Brien", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jussi Jaaskelainen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Carlton Cole", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [82], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex Song", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Reece Oxford", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Burnley", "lineup": [{"name": "Tom Heaton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kieran Trippier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Duff", "yellows": [], "reds": [23], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jason Shackell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Mee", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "George Boyd", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Scott Arfield", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Jones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matthew Taylor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [81]}, {"name": "Ashley Barnes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [79]}, {"name": "Danny Ings", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Ross Wallace", "yellows": [84], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [81], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Kightly", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marvin Sordell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [79], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Reid", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lukas Jutkiewicz", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matthew Gilks", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Keane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "If Burnley’s task was already tough, the challenge now is almost insurmountable. This defeat, courtesy of Mark Noble’s penalty and Michael Duff’s controversial sending off, leaves Sean Dyche’s side eight points adrift of 17th-placed Leicester with nine points to play for. The Championship trapdoor is gaping.\n\nTheir fans still applauded at the final whistle here but the sun is slowly setting on Burnley’s season in the Premier League. That said, there was certainly a sense of injustice in the air following this result, with the referee Jon Moss – who will officiate at the FA Cup final – at the centre of the storm.\n\nLiverpool 2-1 QPR | Premier League match report Read more\n\nMoss awarded a penalty in the 23rd minute after Duff’s clumsy challenge on Cheikhou Kouyaté. A correct decision, but there was an audible gasp inside the ground when he then produced a red card, given the covering defenders in place. Duff trudged off to the dismay of his team-mates and manager, who were hit with a triple-whammy of punishments.\n\nThe game was West Ham’s from thereon and, in fairness, they performed effectively to dominate opponents who continued to work tirelessly. That was little consolation to Dyche, who claimed everyone in the stadium was surprised at the sending off.\n\n“It’s a penalty, I’m amazed it’s a sending off and wholeheartedly disappointed it was a sending off,” Dyche said. “I think there was a stadium full of people that were amazed it was a sending off. The staff were surprised it was a sending off. The subs were surprised it was a sending off. I think the groundsman was surprised it was a sending off. I think the linesmen were surprised it was a sending off. There was a tube station nearby where they were surprised it was a sending off. But other than that.\n\n“I’m amazed and it’s a massive moment in the game. It’s a real sadness to me that at this stage of the season, in these vital games, I’m speaking about the referee’s decision which turned the way the game panned out.”\n\nThings almost began disastrously for Burnley when Aaron Cresswell broke down the left in the opening minutes. The full-back delivered a dangerous low ball across goal where Enner Valencia was well placed, but the onrushing striker could not make any contact.\n\nIt was an early scare but Burnley should have been ahead soon after when Danny Ings, who has not scored since February, spurned a glorious opportunity on the edge of the six-yard box. Matt Taylor found space down the left flank and picked out Ings with a fine cross but his header flew over.\n\nSix minutes later Burnley were a man and a goal down. Valencia controlled well down the West Ham left, cut inside and slid a neat ball in front of Kouyaté. He touched it inside but Duff took his legs away with a clumsy challenge and Moss awarded the penalty. Noble coolly slotted home.\n\nHad it not been for their goalkeeper, Tom Heaton, Dyche’s side would have been further behind before half-time. A swift break found Stewart Downing in space down the right. He pulled the ball back for Valencia but his quickfire shot was palmed brilliantly over the crossbar by Heaton. The goalkeeper was called on again soon after to deny Morgan Amalfitano from a tight angle.\n\nRegarding the sending off, Sam Allardyce said: “It looked unfortunate, yes. The penalty is no doubt. We won 1-0 but we should have won it by more. Our only weakness today was not converting more chances from those we created. As the second half went on we got better and better.”\n\nBurnley continued to fight after half-time, and Ings perhaps should have done better after a break down the right, cutting inside and hitting a shot into the side netting when he had options in the middle. They did, however, come close in the 58th minute when Taylor’s smart effort on the turn from inside the penalty area was saved by Adrián.\n\nIt came in the midst of a frantic spell. From one end to the other, Cresswell pulled the ball back for Nolan to shoot first-time from 20 yards. Heaton saved and the rebound trickled across goal and wide, before Downing was booked for diving.\n\nWest Ham peppered their opponents’ goal in the closing stages and, although they could not break through, Allardyce’s side move to ninth in the table."}, {"date": "02/05/2015", "arena": "Old Trafford", "attendance": 75454, "home_team": {"name": "Manchester United", "lineup": [{"name": "David De Gea", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Antonio Valencia", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Smalling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paddy McNair", "yellows": [62], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [84]}, {"name": "Daley Blind", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [63]}, {"name": "Ander Herrera", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Juan Mata", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marouane Fellaini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wayne Rooney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Young", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robin van Persie", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [74], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Phil Jones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ángel di María", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [63], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Falcao", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [84], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adnan Januzaj", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Valdes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tyler Blackett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andreas Pereira", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "West Bromwich Albion", "lineup": [{"name": "Boaz Myhill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Craig Dawson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gareth McAuley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonas Olsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [63], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joleon Lescott", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Craig Gardner", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [89]}, {"name": "Youssouf Mulumbu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [76]}, {"name": "Claudio Yacob", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Darren Fletcher", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Brunt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Saido Berahino", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [80]}], "subs": [{"name": "Andre Wisdom", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [89], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Baird", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [76], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Brown Ideye", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [80], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Anichebe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Callum McManaman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stéphane Sessegnon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Rose", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "As you were. Louis van Gaal is a duffer all over again after supervising three defeats in a row – the light aeroplane on duty at Anfield might soon be back here at this rate – while Tony Pulis is a genius once more for all but securing safety for his side at the most intimidating of venues.\n\nDoes Old Trafford still intimidate? Darren Fletcher reckons it does and he should know. “The manager reminded us beforehand that we had won here last year,” the former United midfielder said on his first, triumphant return. “You need that belief because a lot of sides are beaten before they get here.”\n\nLouis van Gaal blames Manchester United’s woes on failure to finish Read more\n\nFaced with a packed and determined defence, the home side huffed and puffed but made few inroads, leaving their visitors to steal the points and reach the accepted target of 40 with a slice of luck from a Chris Brunt free-kick that deflected in off Jonas Olsson in the second half. By the end one could only admire West Brom’s chutzpah, a quality United appear to have temporarily mislaid.\n\nThere was a show of support for Rio Ferdinand, after the news of his wife’s death was made public on the morning of the match, with both sets of supporters joining in a minute’s applause. United had Robin van Persie back in the starting lineup for the first time since February, and most of the ground thought he had put the home side into the lead when he met Ashley Young’s cross from the left with a first-time finish at the near post midway through the first half. West Brom had been carved open and Van Persie had the goal at his mercy, yet to the relief of the statuesque Boaz Myhill the drilled low shot passed harmlessly a few inches wide of an upright.\n\nThat was not the first time Young and Van Persie had combined. Craig Dawson had to make a determined block a couple of minutes earlier to prevent Young putting away the rebound when Myhill palmed away a shot from the Dutchman, though the visitors had the earliest and perhaps most inviting opportunity when Joleon Lescott’s free header at a corner went straight at David de Gea.\n\nUnited did most of the attacking without finding too many ways through Tony Pulis’s two lines of defence. When the home side had the ball, which was almost all of the time, West Brom effectively lined up with five across the midfield, with only Saido Berahino as an isolated outlet up front, hoping to keep things tight for as long as possible and rely on set pieces to get men further forward.\n\nThe Pulis game plan was basically to let the opposition have most of the possession and see what they were able to do with it, which turned out to be not an awful lot. After the couple of Van Persie chances earlier Myhill did not have much to do until the final minute of the first half, when he was almost caught out by an unexpectedly powerful Antonio Valencia drive from a narrow angle.\n\nA passage of play at the start of the second half demonstrated what United were up against. Wayne Rooney and Juan Mata spent two minutes or so playing the ball across the edge of the Albion penalty area, first one way, then the other, without finding any line of weakness in a compact defence. Finally Van Persie tired of waiting for a pass and came back to pick up the ball, only for his bright idea, a lofted pass forward in the direction of Marouane Fellaini, to hand possession back to the visitors.\n\nWhen Fellaini went down in search of a penalty a minute or so later, tumbling under an innocuous challenge from Craig Gardner, it seemed a sign that United were becoming a little desperate. They certainly must have felt that way when West Brom took a shock lead, scoring from a set piece – what else? – to leave United staring at their worst league run since 2001.\n\nPaddy McNair had given away a free-kick 25 yards out with a blatant body check on Fletcher, and when Brunt crashed in a shot a fortuitous deflection off Olsson, standing next to the defensive wall, left De Gea no chance.\n\nÁngel Di María must have been wondering when he might get a chance to pit his wits against West Brom’s blanket defence, and the answer came within seconds of his side going behind.\n\nLiverpool 2-1 QPR | Premier League match report Read more\n\nThe only surprise was that Van Gaal did not throw Radamel Falcao and Adnan Januzaj on as well as it was clearly going to take something extraordinary to get back on terms.\n\nThat something appeared to have arrived in the 72nd minute when Berahino was unlucky to be pulled up for handball in the area. Unlucky because it was debatable whether he was actually in the area when Valencia’s cross struck him on the elbow, and even more doubtful whether he had any chance of getting out of the way. That was the extent of United’s luck, however, for Myhill guessed correctly when Van Persie stepped up and dived to his left to beat out an unconvincing penalty.\n\nLuck stayed on West Brom’s side in stoppage time, too, when Myhill produced notable stops to deny first Van Persie and then Di María, though that was more likely a case of great goalkeeping.

Chelsea’s manager had retreated to his seat and was busy cleaning them with his drink bottle when Ramires arrowed in the third goal of a night that leaves the Premier League leaders one win away from being confirmed as champions. Mourinho, one imagines, will not mind too much if the stains don’t come out.\n\nFor a while, his team had looked like they might stretch out the conclusion to the title race longer than anyone had anticipated. Leicester played with great togetherness in the first half and at the interval were threatening to make to it five successive top-flight wins for the first time since 1964. Instead, that turned out to be the point at which Chelsea reminded everyone why they are the best team in this division. The comeback was laced with expertise and their supporters took great joy in mimicking the “Boring, boring Chelsea” chants that had irritated Mourinho more than he was probably willing to let on at Arsenal last Sunday.\n\nHe had let off the handbrake here and his players certainly made the point that it is not an uninteresting team that ends the season on an open-top bus. Cesc Fàbregas, in particular, underlined how remarkable it was that he did not make it on to the Professional Footballers’ Association team of the year. Didier Drogba showed glimpses of his old self and it was typical of John Terry that it was his goal, coming forward from defence, that put Chelsea into the lead 11 minutes from time. “Giants of the pitch,” Mourinho called them.\n\nChelsea certainly had to show great perseverance because Leicester did not resemble a side who had spent seven-eighths of the season looking like certainties for the relegation morgue.\n\nNigel Pearson’s team set off without even a flicker of trepidation. They pressed and they harried but they also played with width and penetration and Esteban Cambiasso’s touches in midfield must have reminded Mourinho about his contribution when Internazionale won the Champions League in 2010. Cambiasso produced one of the night’s outstanding moments to deceive Willian with some improvisational ball-juggling. The Argentinian was on the floor at the time and that, perhaps, summed up the new confidence of this team.\n\nThey also had some rotten luck given the way injuries sabotaged their planning. Andy King was the first player to be forced off after 19 minutes. Robert Huth followed five minutes later and, in the face of all this disruption Leicester did extraordinarily well to keep their structure and take the lead through Marc Albrighton in first-half stoppage time.\n\nWhat they could not do was hold out early in the second half, when it was obvious Chelsea would come back at them. Afterwards, Mourinho was asked what he had said at half-time. “If I told you there would be too many peeps,” he said. Harsh words were exchanged and Chelsea came out reinvigorated.\n\nDrogba’s equaliser came three minutes after the restart and, from that point onwards Leicester barely threatened again. Fàbregas’s ability to show for the ball was hugely influential whereas the quick, incisive football involving Willian and Eden Hazard was a frequent danger. Terry’s goal came from a corner, reacting first after Kasper Schmeichel had palmed away a splendid, twisting header from Gary Cahill. Ramires added the final flourish with a lovely left-foot shot from Fàbregas’s pass and Mourinho could talk afterwards about how pleasing it would be to clinch the title on their own ground. By the time Liverpool head to Stamford Bridge on Sunday week a guard of honour might be needed.\n\nDiego Costa might also be back this weekend, Mourinho confirmed, and Thibaut Courtois should also be fit after missing this game because he was still feeling a bang to a hip. Petr Cech was deputising and four minutes before the interval we were reminded that Chelsea have the best second-choice goalkeeper in the business with his save to turn Paul Konchesky’s snap-shot against a post.\n\nThose moments gave Leicester encouragement to think their opponents might be vulnerable and in their next attack Jamie Vardy ran through the inside-left then turned the ball across the penalty area where, for once, Chelsea’s back four was out of position. César Azpilicueta slipped and that left Albrighton in space to pick his spot.\n\nLeicester could also reflect on that moment early on when Cambiasso’s pass gave Leonardo Ulloa the chance to run clear only for the striker to waste the opportunity with a wretched first touch. Yet their shortcomings were exposed in the second half. Fàbregas was superb and it was his little up-and-over ball that took out three opponents in the moments before the equaliser. Branislav Ivanovic was forward again and Drogba, anticipating the cross, got in front of Ritchie De Laet to flash his shot past Schmeichel.\n\nWhat followed had an air of inevitability. “We played so well, so fluid,” Mourinho reflected, and they did not look like a team who will miss the opportunity against Crystal Palace on Sunday."}, {"date": "28/04/2015", "arena": "KCOM Stadium", "attendance":

matters off the pitch at the moment but Michael Dawson’s first goal since 1 January 2013 meant at least one set of fans went home happy.\n\nThe 31-year-old defender took advantage of Liverpool’s poorly organised attempt to catch him offside and headed Ahmed Elmohamady’s cross beyond Simon Mignolet. It was Dawson’s first goal since joining from Tottenham Hotspur in the summer and it arrived just when Hull needed it most.\n\nDawson ran, celebrating, towards the KC Stadium’s North Stand, from where, some 15 minutes earlier, significant numbers of home fans had voiced their discontent with the owner, Assem Allam and his continued ambition to see the club, renamed Hull Tigers.\n\nDawson’s rare goal also meant the Liverpool supporters seated to their left had more cause for complaint. The visitors had sold out their allocation of about 2,500 despite ticket prices of £48, though many had boycotted the match in objection to the cost. The away section appeared to be less than half full and some of those who had stayed away gathered outside Anfield to protest as part of a demonstration organised by the Spirit of Shankly supporters’ group.\n\nThose supporters who had made the 126-mile journey east did so hoping their faint hopes of a top-four finish would be strengthened. Qualification for the Europa League is probably as much as they can hope for now.\n\nFor the second match in succession, Liverpool failed to score, despite seeing plenty of the ball. Brendan Rodgers described his team’s performance in Saturday’s goalless draw against West Bromwich Albion as “outstanding” and made only one change to his starting lineup. Steven Gerrard appeared to be suffering with cramp towards the end of the match in the Midlands and the 34-year-old was spared an outing in east Yorkshire.\n\nLiverpool’s biggest problem, though, is clearly not in midfield. Without Luis Suárez, now of Barcelona, without Daniel Sturridge, injured more often than not, and with Mario Balotelli, they simply do not pose enough of a threat in attack.\n\nSteve Harper, the Hull goalkeeper, had saves to make – from Philippe Coutinho and twice from Jordan Henderson – but the 40-year-old will have had more strenuous evenings. His opposite number was equally as busy.\n\nDame N’Doye, the Senegalese striker, scored in Hull’s win at Crystal Palace on Saturday and he went close against Liverpool but saw his header from six yards pushed away by Mignolet after Sone Aluko’s cross from the left. Robbie Brady breezed past the right-back Emre Can to send a devilish cross into the six-yard box and Mignolet punched the ball out as far as Jake Livermore. Livermore’s header was goalbound but the goalkeeper made a reflex stop before the ball was hacked clear for a corner.\n\nHull had already troubled Liverpool more then West Brom managed to and the hosts took a deserved lead eight minutes before half-time. Liverpool’s defenders were waiting for a flag to go up against three Hull players in the area when a corner routine looked to have gone awry as Elmohamady’s cross came in from the right. A fourth player, Dawson, however, was not offside and he was free to head home. The defender ran towards the home fans, who all of a sudden seemed in a better mood.\n\n“I thought we deserved it for the way we set ourselves and played,” Steve Bruce said. “We caused them a threat. When you play against Liverpool, you need to defend well and we did.”\n\nGlen Johnson, from left back, attempted to lead Liverpool’s response but saw his low, drilled cross, elude all, including Balotelli.\n\nN’Doye and Aluko gave Hull dynamism in attack and meant the hosts remained a threat from counterattacks as Liverpool pressed for an equaliser.\n\nHull were grateful to Harper when he dived low to his right to keep out a snap-shot from Henderson after Coutinho’s deflected shot fell kindly for the Liverpool captain before Rodgers brought on Rickie Lambert and Adam Lallana in place of Balotelli and Jordon Ibe, who had been about as effective as each other – not very.\n\nHenderson let fly with a shot from 20 yards that Harper gathered the ball at the second attempt and there was time for one last chance for Liverpool as Lallana found space to curl an effort towards goal from the corner of the 18-yard box but the ball drifted narrowly wide. A tame attempt from one of Liverpool’s big summer signings that typified Liverpool’s plight.\n\nFor Hull, it was another haul of precious points and a significant step towards survival. While Rodgers was questioning his team’s mental strength, Bruce was left saluting his players’ resolve.\n\n“I’ve never really doubted the character,” the Hull manager said “We’ve had a lot to put up with injuries and conceding late goals. But the vast majority are desperate to be in the Premier League and that’s shown in the last couple of performances.”"}, {"date": "26/04/2015", "arena": "Goodison Park", "attendance": 39497, "home_team": {"name": "Everton", "lineup": [{"name": "Tim Howard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Seamus Coleman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Stones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [35], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Jagielka", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leighton Baines", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gareth Barry", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Lennon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ross Barkley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [88]}, {"name": "James McCarthy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [5], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leon Osman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [69]}, {"name": "Romelu Lukaku", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [87]}], "subs": [{"name": "Joel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Arouna Kone", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [87], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin Mirallas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [74], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [69], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Naismith", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [88], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Muhamed Besic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Luke Garbutt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Antolin Alcaraz", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Manchester United", "lineup": [{"name": "David De Gea", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Antonio Valencia", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Smalling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paddy McNair", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Luke Shaw", "yellows": [64], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daley Blind", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Juan Mata", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [63]}, {"name": "Ander Herrera", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marouane Fellaini", "yellows": [12], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Ashley Young", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wayne Rooney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [88]}], "subs": [{"name": "Ángel di María", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [63], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Falcao", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adnan Januzaj", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robin van Persie", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [88], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Valdes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tyler Blackett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andreas Pereira", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "The Grim Reaper appeared at Goodison Park to accompany David Moyes to his end as Manchester United manager 12 months ago. This time Louis van Gaal scythed through his players for a lack of “motivation, inspiration and aggression” as their hold weakened on automatic entry into next season’s Champions League. Everton revelled in their latest brand of torment.\n\nThe ramifications of a comprehensive Goodison defeat will not be as severe for Van Gaal as they were for his predecessor last April but this was a galling afternoon for a United team weak in defence and devoid of penetration in attack.\n\nAt best, their claims on a top-three finish have been undermined by a second successive Premier League defeat. At worst, the Old Trafford side have offered Liverpool a glimmer of hope in the pursuit of Champions League qualification and could be without Wayne Rooney for an extended period with a knee injury. Van Gaal pointed the finger at a complacent attitude throughout the visiting ranks but Everton out-thought and out-played their in-form opponents en route to their biggest win over United since 1992.\n\nJames McCarthy struck an early breakthrough, John Stones glanced home his first Everton goal and the substitute Kevin Mirallas sealed his team’s fifth win in an impressive six-game unbeaten run. This was Van Gaal’s first league defeat by a three-goal margin as United manager and confirmation that Roberto Martínez’s men have learned the lessons of a trying but improving campaign. “We were the better side in every department,” said a proud Everton manager, after a tactically disciplined, determined display.\n\nThere were striking parallels to Everton’s performance in the corresponding fixture last season. Martínez’s team sat deep and were content for United to dominate possession, a 62% share in the first half, yet were the more incisive, clinical team when they had the ball. A two-goal interval lead was also identical to Moyes’ final game as United manager.\n\nEverton were sharp and aggressive from the opening whistle, with McCarthy, looking leaner and quicker than he did on his return from a series of hamstring injuries, and Ross Barkley to the fore. Martínez’s decision to recall Leon Osman on the left of midfield with instruction to track Juan Mata’s runs inside was another factor in the visitors’ struggle to open up their hosts. An early breakthrough suited the Everton approach to perfection.\n\nOnly five minutes had elapsed when Gareth Barry cleared a United corner and allowed his fellow central midfielder to lead a devastating counterattack.\n\nMcCarthy sent Seamus Coleman away down the right – a potent outlet for Everton all afternoon – and though Paddy McNair stopped the full-back’s cross from reaching Romelu Lukaku his touch fell invitingly to the Republic of Ireland international. McCarthy surged through the weakest of challenges from McNair and Daley Blind inside the area, before tucking a neat finish inside David de Gea’s far corner.\n\nUnited should have been level within two minutes only for Marouane Fellaini to squander a gilt-edged chance against his former club. In contrast to a frosty return to Goodison 12 months ago, the Belgium midfielder was afforded a warm reception from his old supporters at kick-off. Their appreciation increased on seven minutes when Fellaini blazed over from 18 yards having dispossessed Barry as the midfielder attempted to control a wild pass out of defence from Stones.\n\nFellaini has been instrumental in United’s rise into the Champions League places but faded badly here after collecting an early booking and was replaced by Radamel Falcao at half-time. “There were several reasons [for the substitution],” admitted Van Gaal. The £27.5m midfielder might have departed earlier had the referee Andre Marriner spotted a deliberate handball as Fellaini lay on the ground claiming a foul from behind by Barry.\n\nHis and United’s day deteriorated regardless.\n\nEverton’s third telling break down their right flank resulted in Chris Smalling conceding a corner from another Coleman delivery. United cleared Leighton Baines’ first driven cross to the near post, did the same with his second but switched off at the third corner from the England left-back. Stones stole a march on the dawdling Antonio Valencia and steered an unstoppable header beyond De Gea and over Ashley Young on the goalline.\n\nThe pattern remained unchanged despite the introduction of Falcao and Ángel Di María in the second half. Tim Howard prevented Rooney hauling United back in the game from close range and saved comfortably from a Falcao header but, for all their control of possession, the visitors offered little pace or penetration up front. They were undone by their interpretation of the offside law as Everton extended their lead with 16 minutes remaining. Lukaku stopped when Barkley’s chipped pass forward found the centre-forward in a clear offside position. United’s defence paused too, but not the onside Mirallas who sprinted on to the loose ball and finished confidently inside De Gea’s near post. Mirallas went close to his second and Everton’s fourth with a powerful drive from 25 yards that the United keeper tipped over. Rooney then limped off after colliding with the otherwise ineffectual Blind. A painful end to another grim Goodison trip for United.\n\nMan of the match James McCarthy (Everton)"}, {"date": "26/04/2015", "arena": "Emirates Stadium", "attendance": 60066, "home_team": {"name": "Arsenal", "lineup": [{"name": "David Ospina", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Hector Bellerin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Per Mertesacker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Laurent Koscielny", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nacho Monreal", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Santi Cazorla", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Francis Coquelin", "yellows": [34], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [76]}, {"name": "Aaron Ramsey", "yellows": [89], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mesut Özil", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alexis Sánchez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Olivier Giroud", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [84]}], "subs": [{"name": "Wojciech Szczesny", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mathieu Debuchy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kieran Gibbs", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Wilshere", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Theo Walcott", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [84], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mathieu Flamini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Welbeck", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [76], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Chelsea", "lineup": [{"name": "Thibaut Courtois", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Branislav Ivanovic", "yellows": [72], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gary Cahill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Terry", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "César Azpilicueta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cesc Fàbregas", "yellows": [23], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Nemanja Matic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ramires", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willian", "yellows": [68], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Eden Hazard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Oscar", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}], "subs": [{"name": "Petr Cech", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Filipe Luis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kurt Zouma", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Didier Drogba", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Mikel Obi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Juan Cuadrado", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ruben Loftus-Cheek", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "By the end, there was the unmistakable feeling that all Arsenal were doing was delaying the inevitable. The earliest Chelsea can win the title now is at home to Crystal Palace next Sunday and, if not then, the following week against Liverpool. The only question is when the coronation happens but the real detail is that the victory parade has already been arranged for 25 May – and there was nothing Arsenal could do here to make that feel even the slightest bit premature.\n\nInstead, we had the result that everybody could probably have predicted when they saw José Mourinho had started with a team devoid of an orthodox centre-forward. Chelsea, once again, showed their qualities of structure and defensive organisation and it is now five games since Arsenal last managed a goal against them. Arsène Wenger has still not beaten Mourinho in 13 attempts and Chelsea stubbornly refused to be drawn into the kind of match that would suit their opponents.\n\n“Boring, boring Chelsea,” Arsenal’s supporters taunted. Mourinho came prepared into his press conference. “Boring?” he asked. “Ten years without a title – that’s boring.”\n\nAs put-downs go, it was one of his better ones. Yet he could hardly deny Chelsea’s conservatism. The tactic was to keep at least half a dozen players behind the ball and insure themselves against the counterattack, Wenger’s weapon of choice. Chelsea are grinding their way to glory but, boy, they are good at these smothering techniques.\n\nJohn Terry made it seem implausible he was not even on the shortlist for the PFA Player of the Year award, leading Mourinho to describe it as the greatest performance he had seen from his captain. César Azpilicueta excelled at left-back and at the final whistle the fist-pumping told its own story. Branislav Ivanovic launched himself into the air. Terry let out a cry of pent-up emotion. Gary Cahill embraced Azpilicueta. That sturdy quartet of thou-shall-not-pass defenders punched the sky and screamed their delight in a collective appreciation of their own work.\n\nDid Chelsea come for the scoreless draw? No, Mourinho always wants to win but the priority was certainly to hold the fort – and there is no better team in England when it comes to subduing high-calibre opponents. It is the first time Wenger’s team have dropped points at home since November and we have to go back to the previous February to find the last occasion they did not score a league goal at home. Mesut Özil, Alexis Sánchez and their other danger men had lots of the ball but there was always that formidable bank of blue shirts ahead of them.\n\nThe paradox, perhaps, is that Chelsea could also reflect the game might have turned out very differently but for the moment, a quarter of an hour in, that provided the game’s biggest controversy. David Ospina, Arsenal’s goalkeeper, was certainly fortunate not to be punished after charging from his goalline, missing the ball and clattering into Oscar. Héctor Bellerín prevented Oscar’s looping effort from bouncing into the goal and Chelsea had every right to argue it should have been a penalty.\n\nWenger admitted afterwards his team had been lucky but Chelsea lose an element of sympathy because of the other occasions they resorted to deceptions to try to win a penalty. Oscar can just about be given the benefit of the doubt after an optimistic fall in front of Bellerín but Cesc Fàbregas deserved all the condemnation that came his way when he wafted his leg in the direction of Santi Cazorla, then plopped to the ground in the vain hope that the referee, Michael Oliver, might be conned. All of Mourinho’s grievances will be undermined as long as his players try it on this way.\n\nArsenal had complaints of their own bearing in mind the incident later in the first half when Cahill’s left arm blocked Cazorla’s goal-bound shot inside the penalty area. Özil was Arsenal’s greatest threat in the first half. Aaron Ramsey’s link-up play with the overlapping Bellerín was another feature but, with less of the ball, Mourinho’s team still created the best chances of that period. Fàbregas’s pass for Oscar’s opportunity was the outstanding moment and, seven minutes before the interval, Ramires ought to have done better after Willian’s pass.\n\nOscar had to go off at half-time, taken to hospital and still suffering the effects of the collision with Ospina, and Didier Drogba took over as their centre-forward to give the team a more orthodox look.\n\nFàbregas took up a more attacking position and Willian switched to the right, with Ramires dropping inside to partner Nemanja Matic. Yet their tactics rarely deviated. At one point Willian led a promising break and there was only Drogba and Fàbregas who showed the faintest interest in supporting their colleague. The rest hung back.\n\nFàbregas had a mixed afternoon on his first game back at his old club. A lot of passes were misplaced and, in the worst moments, it felt as if the protective mask he is wearing to protect a broken nose must be hampering his vision.\n\nFàbregas eventually removed it after one lapse. There were boos every time he touched the ball and, unforgivably, one Arsenal supporter decided the minute’s silence for the forthcoming 30th anniversary of the Bradford City fire was an appropriate time to abuse an old favourite. Equally, many applauded him when the Spaniard was substituted late on.\n\nThe more important matter for Chelsea was that they had edged another point closer to where they want to be. The substitute Danny Welbeck could not adjust his feet quickly enough with a stoppage-time chance and Chelsea’s celebrations at the end were so jubilant it said one thing: they knew.\n\nMan of the match John Terry (Chelsea)"}, {"date": "25/04/2015", "arena": " Mary's Stadium", "attendance": 31622, "home_team": {"name": "Southampton", "lineup": [{"name": "Kelvin Davis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathaniel Clyne", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "José Fonte", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Maya Yoshida", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Bertrand", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Toby Alderweireld", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Morgan Schneiderlin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "James Ward-Prowse", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [62]}, {"name": "Sadio Mané", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Davis", "yellows": [66], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [81]}, {"name": "Graziano Pellè", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [29, 65], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Florin Gardos", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shane Long", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [62], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dusan Tadic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eljero Elia", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [81], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paulo Gazzaniga", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harrison Reed", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matt Targett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Tottenham Hotspur", "lineup": [{"name": "Hugo Lloris", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eric Dier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Federico Fazio", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jan Vertonghen", "yellows": [31], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Davies", "yellows": [34], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [76]}, {"name": "Ryan Mason", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nabil Bentaleb", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [87]}, {"name": "Erik Lamela", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [43], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Eriksen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nacer Chadli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [70], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [83]}, {"name": "Harry Kane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Vlad Chiriches", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [76], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Roberto Soldado", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [87], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "DeAndre Yedlin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michel Vorm", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andros Townsend", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mousa Dembélé", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [83], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Benjamin Stambouli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "What a stew of emotions for Mauricio Pochettino. Maybe this draw could be considered a diplomatic outcome to the Spurs manager’s return to the club that he professes still to love, but the result edged his team closer to a tournament that he is reluctant to reach.\n\n“If we reach the Europa League we need to try to win it, but that’s not my dream,” said Pochettino after gaining a point that keeps his team closer than Southampton to qualifying for the continent’s second competition. It was a point that Spurs struggled to earn, twice coming from behind in a match in which their hosts were often superior.\n\nAt least the reception given to Pochettino on his first return to St Mary’s since defecting to Tottenham last summer was not as hostile as predicted, as some Southampton fans had vowed to make it. The Argentinian was met before kick-off by a smattering of boos rather than a torrent of abuse. Others in the home crowd had resolved to declare their affection for their current manager instead of pouring scorn on their ex, but even the so-called “Ronald Koeman Day” did not take off – there were pockets of people dressed in Dutch orange around St Mary’s, but most of them were stewards in high-visibility bibs.\n\nWhen play got under way, the hostility towards Pochettino did briefly rise, probably because fans felt the need to entertain themselves during an uneventful opening on the pitch. “I was focused on my job,” said Pochettino of the back-and-forth chanting by rival fans. “We will always love Southampton. I say thank you to [Spurs fans] because they showed support to me.”\n\nIt was 24 minutes before anyone had a shot, Morgan Schneiderlin meeting a corner with a side-footed volley that forced Hugo Lloris into a good save.\n\nOne area where Southampton have improved hugely under Koeman is in defence. Tottenham’s rearguard have not made similar progress under Pochettino and the Argentinian was visibly aghast at the bungling that allowed Southampton to take the lead in the 29th minute. Graziano Pellè poked the ball into the net from eight yards after a misplaced pass and slip by Ryan Mason and dithering by Ben Davies, who, in fairness, was also shoved by Pellè.\n\nAll very sloppy, but two minutes later Southampton produced a slick move that should have resulted in a second goal. After composed play by José Fonte, Ward-Prowse swept the ball wide to Ryan Bertrand, who pinged a low cross to Steven Davis, who shanked wide from the edge of the area.\n\nSuddenly the match had fizz. In the 42nd minute Nacer Chadli jinked his way down the left and clipped a cross to Mason, whose volley was blocked by Fonte. One minute later Spurs drew level – and the home crowd found another Argentinian villain. After Eric Dier crossed from the right and Harry Kane flicked on, Érik Lamela diverted the ball into the net from seven yards with the help of an arm. The referee, Jon Moss, could be excused for not spotting the offence, which was not blatant enough to belong in the Diego Maradona category.\n\nSouthampton were much better in the second half. Except for Davis, who twice shot wide from good positions. His miss in the 54th minute was particularly galling, as he blazed wide from 10 yards after a lovely move.\n\nSouthampton regained the lead with a goal that reflected their improvement, even if Spurs’ defence was again deficient. Mané pounced on a poor header by Davies and fed Shane Long, who had just been sprung from the bench. The Irishman crossed and Pellè sent a powerful header into the net from 10 yards.\n\nSouthampton seemed on course for victory. But in the 70th minute Dier bisected the home defence with a low pass and Chadli held off Maya Yoshida to slot into the net. Fonte headed narrowly over from a stoppage-time corner but, in the end, Koeman had to congratulate Spurs for being more clinical than his team. “Spurs were not lucky, we need to shoot more on target,” he said."}, {"date": "25/04/2015", "arena": "Turf Moor", "attendance": 19582, "home_team": {"name": "Burnley", "lineup": [{"name": "Tom Heaton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kieran Trippier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Duff", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jason Shackell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Mee", "yellows": [66], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "George Boyd", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [71]}, {"name": "David Jones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Scott Arfield", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matthew Taylor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [59], "sub_off": [86]}, {"name": "Danny Ings", "yellows": [73], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lukas Jutkiewicz", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [71]}], "subs": [{"name": "Ross Wallace", "yellows": [85], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [71], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Kightly", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [86], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marvin Sordell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [71], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fredrik Ulvestad", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matthew Gilks", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stephen Ward", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Keane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Leicester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Kasper Schmeichel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marc Albrighton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [72]}, {"name": "Marcin Wasilewski", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robert Huth", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wes Morgan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paul Konchesky", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Drinkwater", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [77]}, {"name": "Esteban Cambiasso", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andy King", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jamie Vardy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [60], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leonardo Ulloa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [65]}], "subs": [{"name": "Ritchie de Laet", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [72], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matthew Upson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matthew James", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [77], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Riyad Mahrez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mark Schwarzer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Wood", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andrej Kramaric", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [65], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Leicester City are in danger of turning into an unstoppable winning machine.

Yet Burnley are bottom with four matches left – three of them away from home – and, if they go down, they will look back at the moment when Taylor sent Kasper Schmeichel the wrong way with his penalty, only to see the ball hit the left post and spin wide. “The game is cruel sometimes,” Dyche said. “We miss a penalty, they score 60 seconds later.”\n\nDyche struck a mood of defiance, but this felt like a game that Burnley needed to win. Then again, Leicester looked dead and buried not that long ago, no matter how many times you left their matches willing them to turn impressive, gutsy performances into something more substantial. They were winning plaudits rather than points, each ‘so near yet so far’ moment pushing them closer to the Premier League’s trapdoor.\n\nThe mood changed when Leicester beat West Ham United at the start of April and last weekend’s win over Swansea City hauled them off the bottom of the table for the first time in 140 days, although history is still against them; no team has survived after spending that long at the foot of the table. Yet there is little a struggling side values more than momentum.\n\nWhat Burnley would give for a taste of the stuff. It is not hard to pinpoint the source of their problems. If Dyche told his players to run in today’s London Marathon, they would sprint to the start line, but they have scored only three goals in their past 10 matches (curiously they came against Chelsea, Manchester City and Manchester United).\n\nTheir attacking deficiencies were exacerbated by the absence of the suspended Ashley Barnes and the injured Sam Vokes. The goals have dried up for Danny Ings and it was telling that his partner, Lukas Jutkiewicz, has not scored this season.\n\nIngs was often starved of service by Leicester’s three-man defence and Burnley, huffing and puffing in the final third, were reliant on set-pieces. They threatened once in the first half, from a corner, but Taylor could not force the ball past Schmeichel from close range.\n\nStoke City 1-1 Sunderland | Premier League match report Read more\n\nLeicester were not much better, and when they lost their shape at the start of the second half, Burnley almost capitalised. Jutkiewicz and Ings linked up for the first time, the latter’s shot was saved by Schmeichel, and Paul Konchesky clumsily brought down Taylor on the right side of the Leicester area.\n\nYet, soon, Taylor was crumpled in a heap on the penalty spot, his head in his hands, and what happened next was predictable. Michael Duff inadvertently diverted Marc Albrighton’s dangerous cross goalwards and, although Tom Heaton clawed the ball out, Vardy scored from a yard out.\n\nBurnley roused themselves in the final 10 minutes. Schmeichel made a wonderful reaction save from Ben Mee’s deflected volley and Ross Wallace, on in place of George Boyd, clipped a shot straight at the Leicester goalkeeper.\n\nThere were six minutes of stoppage time and even Heaton was in the Leicester area as Burnley threw everything at the visiting team’s defence in their search for an equaliser. The sound of Anthony Taylor’s final whistle, however, was met with deflation from the Burnley supporters and unbridled elation in the away end."}, {"date": "25/04/2015", "arena": "Selhurst Park", "attendance": 23876, "home_team": {"name": "Crystal Palace", "lineup": [{"name": "Julian Speroni", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Kelly", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Scott Dann", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Damien Delaney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pape Souaré", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jason Puncheon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mile Jedinak", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [64]}, {"name": "James McArthur", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wilfried Zaha", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [73]}, {"name": "Glenn Murray", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [59]}, {"name": "Yannick Bolasie", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Brede Hangeland", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yaya Sanogo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [59], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wayne Hennessey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dwight Gayle", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [73], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chung-Yong Lee", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [64], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordon Mutch", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Ledley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Hull City", "lineup": [{"name": "Steve Harper", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Chester", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Dawson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paul McShane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ahmed Elmohamady", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jake Livermore", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Huddlestone", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stephen Quinn", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [74]}, {"name": "Robbie Brady", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [84]}, {"name": "Dame N'Doye", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [90, 51], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sone Aluko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [85]}], "subs": [{"name": "Liam Rosenior", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [84], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Maynor Figueroa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex Bruce", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [85], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Abel Hernandez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yannick Sagbo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gaston Ramirez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [74], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Allan McGregor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "This has suddenly become the place to go for struggling Premier League clubs in search of points to calm relegation nerves. West Bromwich Albion claimed three there eight days ago and on Saturday it was Hull City’s turn.\n\nThe opening goal might have been disallowed for handball by another referee on another day, and only Mark Clattenburg saw the foul that ruled out what would have been an equaliser by Yaya Sanogo for Crystal Palace after 83 minutes, but Hull will not care after holding out for the win that kept them out of the bottom three.\n\nIt was their first victory in seven matches and a vital one. With home matches against Liverpool, Arsenal, Burnley and Manchester United and a trip to Tottenham remaining, this was a game they had to win, and they deserved to. They came into the match bottom-but-one of the form table over the past six games, but they looked up for the fight while Palace’s minds seemed to be on the beaches.\n\n“The manner of the performance from us, from the moment we kicked off, was there for everyone to see,” Steve Bruce said. “You’ve got to have the courage to take the ball and play, and we were worthy winners. Now we’ve got four out of five at home, we’re against big teams and we know we have to get a result against at least one of them, and the Burnley game looks huge.”\n\nDame N’Doye, the Senegal forward signed for £3 million from Lokomotiv Moscow in January, shrugged off the disappointment of a barely believable miss before the break to score early and late in the second half, his fourth and fifth goals for the club. “He has given the team a lift,” Bruce said. “You’re only as good as what you have up front.”\n\nPalace have now lost nine home games, more than any other team in the division, and although Alan Pardew admitted that Hull had deserved their result, he was unhappy about time-wasting and the non-award of a penalty to his team for a second-half trip on Wilfried Zaha as well as Clattenburg’s other rulings. “Big decisions went against us,” he said. “But we weren’t at it today as we have been. We will address that.”\n\nBruce, manager at Palace for five months in 2001 before departing for Birmingham City via a spell of gardening leave, was jeered to his place in the dugout by Palace fans with long memories, but he had the last laugh even if Hull had two early escapes when James Chester appeared to handle Jason Puncheon’s free kick, and then Glenn Murray put a good chance straight at Steve Harper, the Hull goalkeeper.\n\nBut Palace were just as uncertain in defence and after 15 minutes Robbie Brady’s first-time cross from the left found N’Doye unmarked four yards out, but he somehow managed to produce an effort that looked more like a well-timed clearance than a shot at goal. Far more impressive was Tom Huddlestone’s 22-yard curler four minutes later that was bound for the top far corner until Julián Speroni leapt to his left to turn the shot away.\n\nThe goal Hull had threatened came after 51 minutes, but Brady’s hand clearly made contact with the ball as he controlled a high pass from Sone Aluko before setting up N’Doye to score from a yard out. Controversial or not, it looked likely to be enough until the Palace substitute Sanogo headed past Harper seven minutes from time. But Clattenburg indicated that the forward had pulled back Paul McShane, a foul of which there was little evidence on TV replays.\n\nIn a final flourish, Hull hit the bar through Liam Rosenior’s dipping volley before N’Doye broke away to finish with a low shot across Speroni as Palace pushed up in vain search of an equaliser."}, {"date": "25/04/2015", "arena": "St James' Park, Newcastle",

disappointment for Newcastle United’s head coach as his side sank to a seventh straight defeat.\n\nAs Garry Monk celebrated reaching the 50-point mark – a Premier League record for eighth-placed Swansea –Newcastle were left five points above the bottom three. In mitigation, Carver’s squad is woefully under-staffed and his switch to a diamond formation prompted an initially much improved performance.\n\nManchester City 3-2 Aston Villa | Premier League match report Read more\n\n“Unlike last week there’s not many in the dressing room I’m really critical of,” said a man forced to retreat into his dugout during a second half when he was cruelly abused by a couple of moronic fans. “But when you’re on a run like ours confidence is low and you could see it draining.\n\n“I’m aware of the league table but it’s all about us, not anyone else. We’ve got four massive games coming up [away at Leicester and QPR and at home to West Brom and West Ham] and we’re not ready to throw in the towel. I know I’m getting stick from the crowd but I’ll take it on the chin and fight until the end.”\n\nAs Carver spoke, the cautious optimism he must have felt during an encouraging first half had long since evaporated and the moment Ayoze Pérez tapped the ball into an unguarded net from three yards seemed to belong to a different world.\n\nOn an afternoon punctuated by slapdash clearances – mostly from Newcastle – Jordi Amat’s error in the wake of a fine run and cross from the much improved Emmanuel Rivière left Swansea pulled horribly out of shape and Pérez well placed to capitalise.\n\nFor a while Newcastle controlled the tempo, pressing with an intensity unseen in recent weeks. As promised the 34th minute saw virtually the entire stadium getting to their feet and variously chanting “If you hate Ashley stand up” and “We want Ashley out of our club.” The timing was a reference to the £34m left lying in Newcastle’s bank account by Mike Ashley, the club’s owner, for “cash flow purposes” in a season which has left Carver’s squad alarmingly skeletal.\n\nIt would ultimately prove illusory but at that point he appeared to have made a decent job of air-brushing his team’s manifold deficiencies.\n\nWith the diamond sparkling, his latest ersatz ensemble were playing some nice stuff featuring pleasing width and neat passing interchanges. In one particularly tone-raising cameo Rivière forced Lukasz Fabianski into a stellar save after cleverly playing Vurnon Anita in before subsequently meeting his cross.\n\n“We were in control and defending set-pieces, our real achilles heel, was my only worry,” said Carver.\n\nHis worst fears were duly realised as Gylfi Sigurddson whipped in a corner and the unmarked Benfica loanee Nélson Oliveira scored his first goal in English football by heading beyond Tim Krul from 10 yards.\n\nIt marked a turning point for Swansea. Monk’s players emerged for the second half in rejuvenated mood and Sigurdsson swiftly provided them with the lead. His crisply clever finish came at the end of a slick, incisive move initiated by Krul’s sub-standard kick.\n\nStoke City 1-1 Sunderland | Premier League match report Read more\n\nIt facilitated Jefferson Montero’s advance from the left, Oliveira’s cute dummy and Sigurdsson’s first-time, 10-yard shot.\n\nFew seemed surprised when Jack Cork tapped Swansea’s third goal home. Prefaced by a sharp counter-attack it saw Oliveira display an enviable change of pace as he accelerated down the right channel before picking out Cork, the ball passing through the struggling Mike Williamson’s legs en route.\n\nA glimmer of Geordie hope was about to appear on the horizon in the shape of Siem de Jong stepping off the bench. A £6m playmaking signing from Ajax last summer, the Dutchman has spent the season sidelined by first a thigh injury and then a collapsed lung. Here he reduced the deficit by cushioning Jack Colback’s lofted cross before volleying beyond Fabianski’s grasp.\n\n“De Jong was the shining light,” said Carver. “You can see why he’s a top player.”\n\nDespite some subsequent, superior, touches even the De Jong factor could not quite spoil Monk’s party. “Very satisfying,” he said of reaching that 50-point landmark. “I’m extremely proud.”"}, {"date": "25/04/2015", "arena": "Kiyan Prince Foundation Stadium", "attendance": 18036, "home_team": {"name": "Queens Park Rangers", "lineup": [{"name": "Robert Green", "yellows": [],

Without his goals this season QPR would have long been dead and buried in the race for survival but Charlie Austin’s first-half penalty miss in this otherwise dull game has left Chris Ramsey’s team on the brink of relegation.\n\nThe QPR manager had spoken before kick-off of his side requiring three victories from their remaining five games if they were to survive and how costly could the striker’s 23rd-minute effort, which was saved by Adrián in the West Ham goal, become for the west London side.\n\nBurnley 0-1 Leicester City | Premier League match report Read more\n\nEarlier in the campaign QPR were reliant on their home form to remain in touch, but since Ramsey assumed control in February their record in west London has wilted and this result made it nine without a win on their own turf.\n\nConsidering West Ham’s limp performances of late, this represented Rangers’ best chance of victory. Now daunting trips to Liverpool and Manchester City await. Time is running out. “Realistically we still need to win but two might just do it. We have to approach these next two like finals,” Ramsey said afterwards.\n\nAs for West Ham, their form line reads one win from 13. A season that promised much has turned stodgy and some players appear to have one eye already trained on sun, sea and sand. Some of the visiting support must have wished they could change their team as easily as David Cameron after this display. “A scrappy battle,” was how Sam Allardyce described the dour affair.\n\nIt had actually started brightly when Sandro’s low drive was saved by Adrián 50 seconds in, and West Ham’s Reece Burke, making his first Premier League start at 18, had a header cleared off the line by Nedum Onuoha. But the game rapidly deteriorated into one bereft of quality. Neither side were able to take control, making Austin’s miss all the more crucial.\n\nIt was awarded when Bobby Zamora shot and James Collins reacted by raising his right arm to block it. Austin drove it low and hard down the middle but Adrián got down to deny the striker an 18th of the season. It was the Spaniard’s third straight save from the spot. “He spreads fear across the league,” Allardyce said of his keeper.\n\nStoke City 1-1 Sunderland | Premier League match report Read more\n\nMatt Phillips had a couple of half chances before the break but apart from that little of note occurred following the penalty, though the second period showed fleeting signs of life. Stewart Downing shot wide after cutting in from the right, before Rob Green produced an impressive save to turn Aaron Cresswell’s free-kick over his crossbar. At the other end Sandro blasted wildly over before Zamora turned Burke on the edge of the area but could not find the target.\n\nLeroy Fer’s introduction with a shade more than 20 minutes to go invigorated the hosts and they had the ball in the net in the 73rd minute through Richard Dunne, only for it to be ruled out by the referee, Mike Jones, after Steven Caulker fouled Adrián from a Phillips corner, leaving Ramsey displeased. “I don’t want to go down the route of criticising referees, but …” the manager sighed.\n\nDesperation took hold, meaning QPR were also living dangerously and Cheikhou Kouyaté should have punished them when fed by Valencia.

Yet by the end of these 90 frenzied minutes at the Britannia Stadium a trying week concluded with them sinking into the Premier League’s bottom three.\n\nConnor Wickham had capitalised on Asmir Begovic’s blunder to stun Stoke City and give Dick Advocaat’s team a first-minute lead, yet a deserved Charlie Adam leveller combined with results elsewhere mean the visitors’ plight became even more perilous heading into their remaining five matches.\n\nThis could yet prove a vital draw. Yet, right now, slipping into that bottom three – they trail 17th-placed Leicester City by a point – amounts to another demoralising setback as the north-east club still come to terms with Adam Johnson being charged on Thursday with three offences of sexual activity with a 15-year-old girl. Despite the winger being cleared to continue to play for Sunderland, the England international was not included in their 18-man party to face Mark Hughes’s team.\n\n“He didn’t train for three days so I thought it was better for him to stay away,” Advocaat said. “Let’s wait and see what will happen in the next days.”\n\nAs for his team’s predicament, Advocaat is remaining calm. “Yes [we are in the relegation zone] but this was an away game,” the Dutchman said. “That’s why I was surprised about Hull winning away.\n\n“We were close second half but not close enough. Next week it’s our chance again. We have five games to go and everything is open for the bottom five or six clubs. I am pleased with a point.”\n\nThe early portents had been promising for them. Will Buckley’s right-wing delivery across the face of goal looked every inch a routine ball for Begovic to deal with. But the Bosnia international somehow allowed it to spill from his grasp and, with the goal gaping, it fell perfectly for Wickham to dispatch.\n\nA golden opportunity for the visitors came after Erik Pieters failed to intercept Lee Cattermole’s probing ball to allow Jermain Defoe to race through yet, with the angle acute, he drilled into the side-netting.\n\nIt proved a pivotal moment as soon Stoke were level. Approaching the 27th minute, it was a blockbuster strike from Adam – as so often they are – as he rewarded Marko Arnautovic’s elusive footwork and lay-off inside the area with a thunderous shot which arrowed into the top-right corner. That made it three goals in his last four matches for the Scotland international.\n\n“It was a great strike from Charlie on his wrong foot which shows you the quality of his strike,” Hughes said. “It was a great response from us, I thought it was the best we’ve played for quite some time.”\n\nThere were opportunities aplenty at either end. Philipp Wollscheid could count himself extremely fortunate on the hour mark when Ryan Shawcross came to Stoke’s rescue with a fine last-ditch interception to deny Wickham, after his central-defensive partner had been caught dawdling in possession.\n\nIt was, by their usual standards, tentative defending from the home side. They looked odds-on to be punished when Billy Jones capitalised on two untimely slips from Stoke bodies to surge through only for him to be thwarted by Begovic. Redemption in some form.\n\nAnother mind-boggling save soon came at the opposite end as Mame Biram Diouf, having chested down Adam’s free-kick inside the six-yard area, looked certain to score, yet Costel Pantilimon saved superbly from point-blank range.\n\nWith 10 minutes remaining Peter Odemwingie was introduced to a rousing reception for his first appearance since suffering cruciate knee ligament damage against in August.\n\nHughes added: “It’s a little bit soon for him, he’s not ready to start games yet but hopefully he can contribute in the remaining games.”"}, {"date":

already knew. With Luis Suárez long gone and Daniel Sturridge absent once again, Liverpool are unrecognisable from the team that swept opponents aside last season and it is easy to see why the manager talked on the eve of this match about signing a consistent goalscorer who can perform “at a top level every week”.\n\nMario Balotelli, making his first league start for five months, showed why he is not that man, on a day when Steven Gerrard’s 500th Premier League appearance for Liverpool turned into something of a nonevent.\n\nBurnley 0-1 Leicester City | Premier League match report Read more\n\nThe Italian was involved in Liverpool’s best moment of the match, when he released Jordon Ibe and the winger struck the crossbar, but it was hardly a performance that pointed to a brighter future at Anfield.\n\nAs for Gerrard, the 34-year-old spent the afternoon patrolling the area in front of the back four, watching Liverpool dominate the ball but struggle time and again to break Tony Pulis’s team down. There was plenty of huffing and puffing from the visitors but not much penetration or refinement, as the statistics showed. Liverpool enjoyed 74% of possession but managed only five shots on target, one more than Albion.\n\nWith Liverpool’s hopes of finishing in the top four looking slim beforehand, Rodgers conceded after another two points were dropped that it would be “very difficult” to qualify for the Champions League. The Liverpool manager talked about the need to win all five of their remaining games “to give ourselves a chance”.\n\nThat looks unlikely on this evidence. “We just needed a little break,” Rodgers said. “West Brom defended very well, they play with a really low block, so you’ve got to be patient and work your way through. In the first half the idea was good but we were probably just a little bit slow in our play. The second half was much better but we needed that little bit of luck or quality that didn’t come our way.”\n\nLiverpool, in truth, were toothless as an attacking force and Rodgers needs no telling why. “If you take 52 goals out of our team it doesn’t help you,” he said. “We had two players last year who played in our front three and between them got 50-plus goals, and we don’t have that. We just don’t score as many goals, it’s as simple as that. It’s an area that we will look at in the summer and definitely one that we have to do some work on.”\n\nAfter a soporific first half that felt more like a pre-season friendly, the game flickered into life after the interval. Boaz Myhill, the Albion goalkeeper, denied Philippe Coutinho and Jordan Henderson after Balotelli’s close-range effort had been blocked, while at the other end Craig Gardner, meeting Chris Brunt’s deep cross on the full, volleyed into the side-netting.\n\nManchester City 3-2 Aston Villa | Premier League match report Read more\n\nThen came that opportunity for Ibe. Cutting in from the left, the 19-year-old swapped passes with Balotelli, darted into the area and struck a rising left-footed shot that cannoned off the top of the crossbar. At the other end, James Morrison’s far-post header was hacked clear by Dejan Lovren and Simon Mignolet stuck out a boot to keep out Callum McManaman’s low effort.\n\nLovren was one of Liverpool’s better players and had a late chance to win the game but his injury-time header, from Gerrard’s diagonal cross, sailed the wrong side of the upright. Seconds later the Albion supporters were celebrating the point that inches them closer to safety.\n\nPulis praised the effort and commitment of his players but, even with 37 points on the board, Albion’s head coach refuses to accept that they are safe. “Four games [left] and we need to pick points up,” he said. “I’ve been in this game long enough to know that strange things can happen.”"},

frankly ludicrous dalliance with the Irons, your boys took a hell of a beating.\n\nActually they didn’t. That was just a topical reference. Aston Villa were quite good for much of this game and a little unlucky not to take something from it, though, in common with the Prime Minister, they suffered a brainfade that people are going to be tittering about for years. Villa might be going to Wembley, but fans singing that happy tune had the smiles wiped off their faces when Sergio Agüero stepped up to put City in front with virtually his first touch of the ball.\n\nWest Bromwich Albion 0-0 Liverpool | Premier League match report Read more\n\nTim Sherwood’s side are not yet in the sort of league position to give away comedy goals less than three minutes in, yet that is exactly what happened here. Agüero will probably never score an easier goal, or a more unexpected one, after being handed the opportunity on a plate by a miskick by Brad Guzan. The Villa goalkeeper fielded a back pass from Ron Vlaar on one side of his area and was attempting to feed it out to Jores Okore on the other, already a risky strategy as he had no real need to be playing a ball across the face of goal. His miskick simply invited Agüero to find an empty net from near the penalty spot, which he duly did as the Villa defenders involved stared at each other open-mouthed.\n\n“Brad will get over it, but it’s hard enough coming here without offering gimmes,” Sherwood said. “It was a poor start, but we performed well afterwards; if we play like that in our remaining games we’ll be OK. We were a bit unlucky right at the end when Christian Benteke was wrongly flagged for offside – that should have been a penalty and a sending off – but wherever we play, we go into games expecting to win now.”\n\nA bad start could easily have got worse for the visitors had Jesús Navas been able to demonstrate speed of thought as well as foot when he was played in behind the Villa cover minutes later. The Spaniard was bearing down on goal before Villa were fully awake to the danger, but as happens quite often he was unable to be decisive about whether to pass or shoot, and Kieran Richardson came back to block him while he was still making up his mind.\n\nGuzan, jeered every time he had to deal with the ball on the floor, was also showing signs of nervousness in his decision-making, coming out to claim an Aleksandar Kolarov free-kick and missing it by a mile to let Fernando get in a header.\n\nVilla somehow managed to reach the interval without further mishap, even creating a couple of chances of their own around the half-hour mark.\n\nJoe Hart saved with his legs when Benteke shot from what looked like an offside position, and when Richardson sent over a cross from the left, Tom Cleverley reached it first, but could not keep his attempt low enough. Jack Grealish showed up well as Villa came back into the game, at one point putting in a change of direction so swift that it left Martin Demichelis on his backside, but mostly demanding the ball in the centre of the pitch then transferring it neatly and efficiently to players in space on the flanks.\n\nBy the time the break arrived, Villa had recovered from their inauspicious opening to the extent of looking the side most likely to score next. They were not exactly peppering Hart’s goal, but they were doing more than the home side, who were inviting the sort of ennui with which the Etihad has become familiar this season by stroking the ball around midfield without any urgency or threat of penetration. It was dull, unimaginative stuff, and Sherwood probably spent the interval telling his players that City were there for the taking.\n\nThat impression would have been reinforced when Yaya Touré failed to come out for the second half, though, in truth, his contribution before a hamstring injury had been minimal. With the game in the balance, Fabian Delph stroked a volley narrowly wide at one end, while Leandro Bacuna got away with tugging over Agüero in the penalty area at the other. Frank Lampard made way for James Milner after an hour, just in time for him to play a part in City’s second goal. Presented with a free-kick when Carlos Sanchez fouled Fernandinho, 20 yards out, Milner dummied to shoot to one side of the goal then left Kolarov to find the other with a left-foot shot around the edge of the wall. Whether Guzan was fooled by the routine is debatable, but he left fractionally too much space to his right and was late to get down to a low and accurate short.\n\nSouthampton 2-2 Tottenham Hotspur | Premier League match report Read more\n\nThat ought to have made the game safe, but the contest was thrown wide open again two minutes later, when Cleverley beat Hart with a thumping drive from the edge of the area as City scrambled to clear a free-kick.\n\nHart had come out to claim the ball and was left in no-man’s land when Fernandinho headed it out instead, straight to Cleverley, who returned it emphatically.\n\nCity withdrew Agüero for Wilfried Bony and promptly saw Villa draw level. An mix-up at a corner, five minutes from the end, resulted in Hart colliding with several of his own defenders as he attempted to punch clear, succeeding only in finding Carlos Sanchez, who came up with a volley right on target.\n\nA draw would have been fair after what had become an enjoyable and evenly contested game, but after Benteke was, possibly wrongly, pulled up for offside before Hart brought him down, City were stirred sufficiently to go upfield and claim a late winner. Villa left Fernandinho unmarked at a corner, and though his first touch was inconclusive, the substitute turned his second into an acrobatic shot that left Guzan with no chance.\n\n“We didn’t play well, but we showed our spirit,” Manuel Pellegrini said. “It is not easy to hit back when you only have a couple of minutes after an equaliser, but we did it.”"}, {"date": "19/04/2015", "arena":

True, West Ham United were the perfect patsies due to a quality deficit but, notwithstanding, the champions ended the game having convinced in all departments.\n\nEliaquim Mangala’s commanding display allowed his season-long struggles to be forgotten. Yaya Touré ran the show from midfield and was pivotal in City’s second goal. And the under-pressure Manuel Pellegrini could enjoy an afternoon when calm was restored and the awful run of six defeats from the last eight outings was arrested. Even when the Hammers rallied towards the close this merely allowed Joe Hart to illustrate again how he has raised his game as the goalkeeper repelled any threat.\n\n“It was important to win because we came here from two defeats,” Pellegrini said. “We must continue working together and it is very important to finish as near to the top of the table as possible.”\n\nCity’s opener featured the sort of luck any team suffering a harrowing slump will gratefully embrace. Jesús Navas took possession near halfway and raced forward along the right. When he glanced up Sergio Agüero had peeled into space in the far corner of West Ham’s area. Navas pinged over a cross towards the striker but the winger’s radar was awry. The ball was at a height where James Collins felt he had to put a boot through it but in doing so the central defender could only lob Adrián and see the ball ricochet in off the frame.\n\nIt was fortuitous but deserved on the balance of play. West Ham were offering only rare moments of menace in an error-strewn display that showed why they arrived here having won only once in the last 11 matches. “You can’t make the mistakes we made and expect to get anything out of the game,” said Sam Allardyce, the West Ham manager.\n\nThe Collins own-goal came in the 18th minute. By the 36th Agüero had City’s second and his 20th in the league this season. The maligned (in some quarters) Touré was crucial. Without the Ivorian sticking out a leg to make a sliding interception inside his half, West Ham would have kept possession. Instead Agüero was able to race forward and swap passes with Navas before he pulled the trigger to beat Adrián and ensure the scoreline reflected how City had coasted through the opening half.\n\nPellegrini had a point beforehand when he suggested City played well in the opening minutes of last Sunday’s 4-2 derby defeat at Manchester United before the team tailed off. The manager was also honest enough to state: “We’ve been doing some things badly.” The chief fault might be a lack of sharpness, a vital edge missing from City’s in-game imagination and execution.\n\nThe opposite was the case on Sunday. When Fernando, playing alongside Touré in central midfield, raced back to catch Cheikhou Kouyaté and snap cleanly into a tackle that killed the threat, he showed what is needed.\n\nCity should have gone further ahead in the second half. Aleksandar Kolarov had a fierce shot blocked by Carl Jenkinson and the latter did the same when Agüero bore down on Adrián at close range after 49 minutes. There was also a long range shot from David Silva that flew over the bar, and a chance for Agüero from a Navas delivery that came to nothing, the Argentinian allowing the ball to slip under his boot.\n\nAs the hour passed and City continued to stroll in the Manchester sun, the sense that they were toying with Allardyce’s men continued. Silva saw a shot cannon off the West Ham defence and a few moments later, when Jenkinson found himself in City’s half, it felt like a collector’s item.\n\nAfter 66 minutes Allardyce had seen enough. Yet to replace Carlton Cole, the lone striker, with Kevin Nolan hardly seemed the answer to West Ham’s ills. The manager also brought on Matt Jarvis for Alex Song, though as the latter had been among Hammer’s better players this may have been injury driven.\n\nA minute or so later and there was no doubt Silva was in discomfort after Kouyaté’s flailing arm downed the playmaker, who required several minutes of treatment. The replays suggested it was unfortunate and innocuous, though Silva was taken off on a stretcher and replaced by Samir Nasri.\n\nIt was the only sour note of a match that by its finish had brought some desperately needed succour to City and their manager before Saturday’s visit of Aston Villa.\n\nMan of the match Yaya Touré (Manchester City)"}, {"date": "19/04/2015", "arena": "St James' Park,

rediscovered his scoring touch, Tottenham Hotspur climbed to sixth place and eyebrows were raised when the official attendance was announced. Sometimes statistics deceive. Admittedly John Carver’s Newcastle ended the afternoon well outclassed but, given their current injury crisis and the slenderness of their squad, they were not always quite as bad as the scoreline might suggest on a day when Kane took quite a while to wake up.\n\nAs for the crowd, officially it was declared to be just over 47,000 but the number of seats left empty looked indicative of a gathering somewhat nearer the 40,000 mark. It seemed a fair number of supporters had responded to pleas for a boycott in protest at Mike Ashley’s ownership of the club.\n\nThose inside St James’ Park would eventually be treated to the sight of Kane recovering from a recent dip in form to score his 30th goal of an extraordinary season but, first, they bore witness to a, rather bizarre, first half fly past from an aeroplane bearing a message from some near, and not so dear, neighbours. Flying arguably lower than is acceptable over a congested public place it trailed a banner declaring : “5 in a row Sunderland.”\n\nIt was a reference to the Wearsiders’s quintet of successive north east derby wins against Newcastle but Sunderland are not really in a position to crow about anything at the moment and a stunt presumably intended to exacerbate Geordie disgruntlement produced zero reaction.\n\nDown on the pitch, Spurs started strongly but allowed Newcastle to grow into the game. So much so that Ayoze Pérez, Carver’s lone forward in an initial 4-1-4-1 formation featuring Ryan Taylor in a holding role and Vurnon Anita at left-back, should probably have done better than sidefoot straight at Michel Vorm from Yoan Gouffran’s cross.\n\nThe impressive Nacer Chadli was soon to display a much more ruthless streak. Benefiting from Gouffran’s needless concession of possession, Chadli advanced purposefully, and unchallenged, before confounding Tim Krul courtesy of a crisp, dipping, swerving, left-footed shot. “We conceded a real poor goal,” acknowledged Carver, although he refused to criticise Krul’s part in it.\n\nHis goalkeeper had got a hand on the ball but could not quite hold it and something similar could be said about Newcastle’s tentative grip on a contest in which they sporadically threatened Spurs without ever really damaging Mauricio Pochettino’s team.\n\nWith the home side gently booed off at the interval Newcastle’s head coach knew something had to change. Accordingly Carver switched to 4-4-2 with Sammy Ameobi and Gabriel Obertan replacing Gouffran and Mehdi Abeid. Within seconds of the restart the alterations paid off.\n\nAmeobi helped initiate a move featuring a neat interchange between Pérez and Daryl Janmaat before Janmaat’s shot was blocked. No matter; the rebound fell kindly for Jack Colback to shoot beyond Vorm from around 10 yards. “Decent but unfortunately it seemed to wake Spurs up and we conceded another stupid goal,” said Carver. “Set pieces are our achilles heel.”\n\nSure enough within minutes of the equaliser Colback’s foul on Christian Eriksen gifted Spurs a free kick in a dangerous position. Forward stepped Eriksen to send a wonderfully curling dead ball skimming imperiously over the heads of Carver’s wholly ineffective defence. A trio of visiting players, including the at that point disappointingly peripheral Kane, attacked it but it eluded everyone. Unsighted until very late Krul’s fingers again looked to brush the ball as it flew into the far corner.\n\nEriksen’s goal only emphasised the success Pochettino’s players were enjoying identifying gaps in Newcastle’s reconfigured midfield and when Chadli crossed invitingly Nabil Bentaleb should have increased their lead. Instead he headed fractionally over the crossbar.\n\nWhen Kane came, finally, to life and directed a seemingly unstoppable volley at Krul another goal seemed inevitable but instead the Holland goalkeeper made a gravity-defying, save. Krul would soon be called to arms once more, this time doing well to deny Érik Lamela but, well cued up by Janmaat, Colback shot insipidly from a promising position.\n\nKane proved considerably more efficient in the 90th minute. With Newcastle pouring forward, Spurs counterattacked thanks to Lamela’s dribble. Collecting his pass, Kane accelerated beyond all comers before drawing Krul and guiding the ball into the bottom corner.\n\nIt left a suitably delighted Pochettino looking forward to another Europa League campaign and Carver distinctly downbeat. “I have to find a new method of trying to play,” he said. “It might not be pretty on the eye, people might not like what they see but we’ve got to find a way of putting some points on the board.”\n\nMan of the match Nacer Chadli (Tottenham Hotspur)"}, {"date": "18/04/2015", "arena": "Selhurst Park", "attendance": 24765, "home_team": {"name": "Crystal

successive season, Pulis has pulled off his great escape act as West Bromwich Albion moved eight points clear of the Premier League drop zone. Defeat meant that Palace failed to match last season’s club record of five top-flight wins in a row, but Alan Pardew will take heart from the knowledge that it could easily have been a different story.\n\n“My team tried everything, but it’s difficult when you concede a goal to West Brom, because they make it difficult,” Pardew conceded afterwards.\n\n“We knew that Tony would know the players well, so we tried to throw a few ideas on the pitch. Sometimes they come off and sometimes they don’t.”\n\nThe return of Pulis to Selhurst Park for the first time since he walked out on them, 48 hours before the opening match against Arsenal, was always going to divide opinion among Palace supporters. Those of a more forgiving nature were perhaps willing to let bygones be bygones, especially given that the club can now look forward to a third successive season in the Premier League after the mid-season arrival of Pardew.\n\nHowever, the nature of Pulis’s departure left a bitter taste in the mouths of some fans and there was more than a smattering of boos to greet his arrival on the touchline. Those had largely disappeared by half-time, with the home supporters instead concentrating their ire on referee Jon Moss’s decision-making.\n\nPardew abandoned his experiment of playing skipper Mile Jedinak in a more advanced role at the break and, instead, threw on Dwight Gayle to partner Glenn Murray. But the plan backfired within eight minutes when Gardner picked up the ball, 30 yards out, after a corner and lashed a shot past the helpless keeper Julián Speroni.\n\nPalace could count themselves unfortunate not to find a way back into the game and, after their recent successes, Pardew acknowledged it was not to be. For his opposite number, however, this was a victory to savour.\n\nFrom the moment Morrison headed in a corner routine honed on the training ground, Pulis must have sensed it could be his day. The former Stoke manager made a point of embracing every one of Palace’s players at the whistle and left the pitch with his arm around Jason Puncheon, with some fans even waiting behind to applaud him off.\n\n“Obviously it is lovely coming back to a former club. You never know – they did well for me last year and I hope I repaid them a little bit in respect to what we did in the dressing room and on the pitch,” said Pulis.\n\n“It is a good club. It has got unbelievable potential and I mean that. They can push on – if Alan is given the money and the opportunity to push this club forward, this could be a good, good club.”\n\nIt’s always easier to be gracious when your team has ended a run of three successive defeats, but Pulis was in no doubt just how important this result was. Concerning home defeats by Leicester and Queens Park Rangers had increased the possibility of West Brom being sucked back into trouble, but they now look to have enough of a cushion, even with matches against Liverpool, Manchester United and Chelsea to come in their run-in.\n\n“We needed a 90-minute performance and they [the players] were resolute and determined,” Pulis reflected.\n\n“Their concentration levels were good on the basis that we still need the points to stay in the league. I said to them afterwards, give me 40 points - I think it has been a good season for us; that is what we should be aiming for.”"}, {"date": "18/04/2015", "arena": "Goodison Park", "attendance": 39496, "home_team": {"name": "Everton", "lineup": [{"name": "Tim Howard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Seamus Coleman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Stones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Jagielka", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leighton Baines", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gareth Barry", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Lennon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James McCarthy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [88]}, {"name": "Ross Barkley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [11], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin Mirallas", "yellows": [51], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [29], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [61]}, {"name": "Arouna Kone", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [80]}], "subs": [{"name": "Joel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aiden McGeady", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Romelu Lukaku", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [61], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Naismith", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [80], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Muhamed Besic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [88], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Luke Garbutt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Antolin Alcaraz", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Burnley", "lineup": [{"name": "Tom Heaton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kieran Trippier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Duff", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jason Shackell", "yellows": [61], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Mee", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "George Boyd", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [84]}, {"name": "Scott Arfield", "yellows": [53], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Jones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [84]}, {"name": "Ashley Barnes", "yellows": [23], "reds": [45], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Ings", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sam Vokes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [59]}], "subs": [{"name": "Ross Wallace", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [84], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Kightly", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matthew Taylor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [84], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lukas Jutkiewicz", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [59], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matthew Gilks", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stephen Ward", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Keane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Form and fortune have deserted Burnley alike. Chaos and controversy ruled instead here. The Clarets’ most distinguished fan, Jimmy Anderson, tops the list of England’s Test wicket-takers, but, for the first time since November, his club prop up the Premier League.\n\nA defining day could have ended with them as high as 16th. Instead, Burnley’s momentum is downward and threatens to drag them into the Championship. They were condemned to an eighth defeat in 12 games by Kevin Mirallas, who ought to have been dismissed afterwards, on an afternoon when a penalty was wrongly awarded against them and squandered in bemusing fashion.\n\nIf Burnley are not receiving official assistance, nor did they help themselves. Ashley Barnes was rightly shown the red card and David Jones was mistake-prone. Brains seemed scrambled as erratic decision-making was not confined to the lamentable referee, Mike Jones. Even the victors were affected, in strangely familiar fashion.\n\nThis marked the second episode of the Goodison Park penalty mystery. Everton possess one of the division’s outstanding finishers from 12 yards. Leighton Baines boasts a 94% success rate from the penalty spot in the Premier League. Yet Mirallas commandeered a penalty he ought to have taken against West Brom and missed. Now, Ross Barkley staged a repeat, albeit without the same sense of insurrection.\n\n“Ross showed incredible responsibility,” said the Everton manager, Roberto Martínez, who, in a confusing, contradictory analysis, described Baines as a “specialist” and agreed with the suggestion he was the club’s best penalty taker, only to state the substitute Romelu Lukaku would have been his preferred candidate.\n\n“There is no such thing as a best penalty taker,” he said, failing to clarify matters. “I don’t agree with penalty takers being a designated one apart from Romelu.”\n\nWhat can be said with certainty is that it amounted to a match to forget for the different Joneses. Burnley’s midfielder David coughed up possession, attempted to make amends and fouled the faster Aaron Lennon. The referee Mike pointed to the spot, even though the challenge was outside the 18-yard area. Up stepped Barkley and Tom Heaton produced an outstanding save.\n\nMike Jones compounded his earlier error by ignoring penalty appeals when Danny Ings crashed into Séamus Coleman. David Jones’s shooting proved as ill-judged as his tackling as he blazed over the bar. Ings’s late header also had too much elevation so Burnley’s goal drought has now extended to 389 minutes.\n\n“There has never been a lack of belief, a lack of organisation or a lack of energy,” said the Burnley manager, Sean Dyche. “It has been the cutting edge and the details of the game.”\n\nThe crucial detail, the scoreline, was determined by Mirallas. Few wide players can rival his goalscoring record and when James McCarthy crossed he skipped past a sliding Kieran Trippier to slide his shot past Heaton.\n\nThere ought to have been a second. Arouna Koné diverted Baines’s cross on to the post with a flick and McCarthy marred an otherwise excellent performance by sidefooting wide when Lennon centred.\n\nMeanwhile, the scorer turned sinner by planting his studs into George Boyd’s shin. Jones only cautioned Mirallas. “It is just a normal action,” said Martínez, defying credibility again. “It is not malicious from Kevin, just a typical striker’s challenge.”\n\nDyche predictably disagreed. “It is high and late,” he said. “It is impossible he stays on the football pitch.”\n\nYet Mirallas did, while Barnes had already departed. Booked for a challenge on McCarthy, he then upended Coleman. He has been the Premier League’s most prolific fouler this season and a 66th offence brought Burnley’s first dismissal. “They are just silly challenges,” said Dyche. “There is no malice.”"}, {"date": "18/04/2015", "arena": "The King Power Stadium", "attendance": 31121, "home_team": {"name": "Leicester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Kasper Schmeichel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marcin Wasilewski", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Robert Huth", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wes Morgan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marc Albrighton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andy King", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [89], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Esteban Cambiasso", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jeffrey Schlupp", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andrej Kramaric", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [74]}, {"name": "Leonardo Ulloa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [15], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [68]}, {"name": "Jamie Vardy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Ritchie de Laet", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paul Konchesky", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Drinkwater", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [74], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matthew James", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Lawrence", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Riyad Mahrez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [68], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mark Schwarzer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Swansea City", "lineup": [{"name": "Lukasz Fabianski", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Angel Rangel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Federico Fernandez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Williams", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordi Amat", "yellows": [3], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Cork", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sung-Yueng Ki", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [58]}, {"name": "Jonjo Shelvey", "yellows": [88], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gylfi Sigurdsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nélson Oliveira", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [75]}, {"name": "Wayne Routledge", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [70]}], "subs": [{"name": "Leon Britton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marvin Emnes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [75], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathan Dyer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [70], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jefferson Montero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [58], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matt Grimes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gerhard Tremmel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Bartley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Leicester City have lift-off at last and what a problem that could prove for other strugglers. Nigel Pearson’s side propelled themselves off the bottom of the Premier League for the first time in more than five months after Leonardo Ulloa and Andy King fired them to a third win in a row. Now they are in the relegation zone on goal difference only and the manner of their victory over Swansea City should make teams fret about being overtaken by them in the race to avoid the drop.\n\nLeicester had been sprawled on the Premier League’s floor since November but they approached this match with a sudden sense of upward mobility, having ended a long winless streak by triumphing in their two previous games. Hey presto, the King Power Stadium, which, in fairness, had never really sunk into despair, was awash with giddy optimism, especially as the visit of Swansea represented the first of five home matches to be staged by Leicester in their last seven games of the season.\n\nPearson was not about to dampen the positivity with a cautious approach, even if he originally omitted his top scorer, Ulloa. The Argentinian had not found the net in his previous 12 matches but his intended replacement, David Nugent, suffered a calf injury during the warm-up so Ulloa was restored to the starting lineup alongside Andrej Kramaric at the top of a 3-5-2 formation that frequently looked like a 3-4-3 owing to Jamie Vardy’s incessant raids forward.\n\nSwansea kicked off but Vardy dispossessed them immediately, exemplifying the vibrancy that enabled Leicester to force the visitors backwards early on. “We lost it in the first 20 minutes, when we were outfought,” Monk rued later.\n\nDespite Leicester’s effervescence, Lukas Fabianski was untroubled until the 15th minute – when he had to fetch the ball from the net. Marcin Wasilewski hoisted a long free-kick into the box and Ulloa flicked it on to Wes Morgan, who held it up eight yards out before laying it back to Ulloa to slam into the net. The end of the striker’s drought heightened Leicester’s belief in survival and the celebrations around the ground were suitably jubilant.\n\nBut Swansea soon showed that they were not willing to be run over. Monk’s side played their way back into contention with their familiar elegance, with Jonjo Shelvey a rising influence. Kasper Schmeichel twice had to save long shots from the midfielder in the first half. The goalkeeper would likely have been in even more difficulty in the 34th minute when Wayne Routledge ran on to a pass from Shelvey but Marc Albrighton made a superb tackle on the edge of his own area.\n\nThe first half ended the way it had started with Swansea struggling to repel waves of Leicester attacks but Pearson had seen enough menace from the visitors to change to a 4-4-2 for the second period. Albrighton nearly made his manager more comfortable in the 48th minute but flashed a shot inches wide from eight yards.\n\nShelvey gave Fabianski a reminder of Swansea’s threat moments later, but there was no let up from Leicester. Ulloa headed just over from a cross by Vardy, before Kramaric mis-hit from 15 yards. Leicester might have paid a heavy price for those misses if Schmeichel had not made a fabulous save to foil Nélson Oliveira in the 66th minute, diverting the striker’s close-range shot with an outstretched foot. “We really should have scored that goal and if we had, the crowd’s attitude would have changed drastically and their players would have felt that nervousness,” said Monk.\n\nFabianski thwarted Riyad Mahrez after a counterattack led by Vardy, who was later denied a penalty after going down in the area under a tackle by Ashley Williams. They got their second three minutes from time, when Fabianski fumbled a free-kick by Esteban Cambiasso and King converted the rebound.\n\n“The danger now is that people get carried away,” Pearson warned. “We’re still in a difficult situation and we’ve got to keep our fate in our hands for as long as possible.”"}, {"date": "18/04/2015", "arena": "Bet365 Stadium", "attendance": 26467,

Stoke.\n\nThe visitors took a deserved lead in the first half through Morgan Schneiderlin, but Stoke equalised through Mame Diouf following an error by the Southampton goalkeeper, Kelvin Davis, and Charlie Adam sealed all three points for the hosts six minutes from time.\n\nSaints could have moved within two points of fourth-placed Manchester City, but they remain in sixth – five points behind the champions, who play West Ham on Sunday.\n\nKoeman was determined to lead the south-coast club to Champions League qualification for the first time in their history this season, but he has downgraded his target following this loss at the Britannia Stadium. “The distance to place is five points,” the Dutchman said. “We are fighting for a Europa League place –that’s our Champions League. You have to see it like that.”\n\nThere was no shame in Koeman’s words. After all, few would have predicted at the start of the campaign that Saints would be competing for any kind of European place in April.\n\nThey were tipped as potential relegation candidates when Koeman took over following the departures of key men like Rickie Lambert, Luke Shaw, Adam Lallana, Dejan Lovren and former manager Mauricio Pochettino.\n\nBut Koeman has got the best out of a bright new bunch of players and the excellent football his team has played throughout the season was evident during much of the first half at the Britannia.\n\nHe admitted it was always going to be hard to secure a top-four finish this term. “It’s very difficult to beat the big ones in the Premier League because of the players they have and can buy,” he said. “Still, I think we are in a very good position. We know our level.\n\n“We try to play good football. That’s the quality of the team.”\n\nThe defeat was difficult to take, though. After Schneiderlin had tapped in his first league goal since September, Graziano Pellè and Nathaniel Clyne missed good chances while Dusan Tadic had an effort cleared off the line by Glenn Whelan.\n\nKoeman felt Saints were robbed of a clear goal-scoring opportunity in the second half when Sadio Mané was flagged for offside after racing through. “It was a bad decision of the linesman about the offside of Mané,” Koeman said. “He was not offside and it was one on one with keeper.”\n\nOn the plus side for Koeman, key defender Toby Alderweireld may play for the club again this season despite being carried off on a stretcher in the dying minutes. “Toby looks OK. It’s his shoulder,” said Koeman. “We have to wait for the scan but he’s back on his feet and he will be good, I think.”\n\nMark Hughes was happy to end a winless four-match run after Adam lashed home the winner from 10 yards after José Fonte had blocked Jon Walters’ shot in the box. He “It’s great technique,” the Stoke manager said of the Scot, who scored from 65 yards against Chelsea a fortnight ago.\n\n“He knows exactly what he is doing. He has hit it into the ground and that has made it even harder for the keeper to save it.”\n\nStoke’s equaliser came when Davis misjudged Steven N’Zonzi’s shot, which hit the angle and Diouf lashed in from close range.Hughes had complained before the match that Stoke’s chances of making the Europa League via the Fair Play League had been compromised by Uefa, which apparently takes a dim view of the fact that Stoke fans sing the Tom Jones song Delilah, which contains lyrics that appear to promote domestic violence.\n\nThe song was repeated on the terraces on Saturday, which brought a smile to Hughes’ face. He said: “We are not going to get too many [fair play] points today. But we got three Premier League points and that is the key.”"}, {"date": "18/04/2015", "arena": "Stamford Bridge", "attendance": 41422, "home_team": {"name": "Chelsea", "lineup": [{"name": "Thibaut Courtois", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Branislav Ivanovic", "yellows": [57], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gary Cahill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Terry", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "César Azpilicueta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kurt Zouma", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nemanja Matic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Oscar", "yellows": [63], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [67]}, {"name": "Cesc Fàbregas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Eden Hazard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [38], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Didier Drogba", "yellows": [54], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Petr Cech", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Filipe Luis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ramires", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [67], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Mikel Obi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willian", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Juan Cuadrado", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dominic Solanke", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Manchester United", "lineup": [{"name": "David De Gea", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Antonio Valencia", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Smalling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paddy McNair", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Luke Shaw", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [80]}, {"name": "Ander Herrera", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Juan Mata", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [70]}, {"name": "Wayne Rooney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marouane Fellaini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Young", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [70]}, {"name": "Falcao", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Rafael", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ángel di María", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [70], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adnan Januzaj", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [70], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robin van Persie", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Valdes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tyler Blackett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [80], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andreas Pereira", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "There really can be no doubt now that when the ribbons are attached to the Premier League trophy the light blue of Manchester City will be replaced by a darker shade of the same colour. José Mourinho’s team are ticking off the challenges and their lead is now 10 points. With half a dozen games to go, the residents of Fulham can expect a letter advising them of plans for an open-top bus parade.\n\nFor long spells it was a conservative and restrained performance, but there is an expertise ingrained in this Chelsea team about the art of winning through structure, stubbornness and get-the-job-done know-how and, when the opposition makes an error, being absolutely clinical. It also helps they have a left-sided attacker, Eden Hazard, who could feasibly finish the season with a clean sweep of the player-of-the-year awards.\n\nHazard’s contribution has been immense and it was his goal, late in the first half, that gave Chelsea the opportunity to show their qualities of endurance. The ovation when he was substituted told its own story and it was not long afterwards that Mourinho was out of his dugout demanding more noise. His team could settle everything by winning their next two matches, against Arsenal and Leicester, and Mourinho was clearly just going through the motions when he insisted it was wrong to assume the title was heading to Stamford Bridge.\n\nTactically, he said, the game had been “exactly what we wanted” and his eulogy did stray dangerously close to sounding like a victory speech. “I’m the one that knows how fantastic it was. JT was amazing. Azpilicueta was the best player on the pitch. Matic worked like an animal. Zouma put Fellaini outside the game. The No11 [Didier Drogba] was another animal, fighting against two kids with the age to be his sons. And Hazard was what we know. Eden had that magic.”\n\nMourinho seemed pretty pleased with himself too bearing in mind the tactical straightjacket that meant all of United’s better performers recently – not just Fellaini but also Ashley Young, Juan Mata and Ander Herrera – were subdued. Radamel Falcao did strike the post in the second half but the player of old would have converted that chance and Louis van Gaal took everyone by surprise when he described it as United’s best performance of the season. The exaggeration was complete when he said Chelsea had not even managed a single chance in the first half. Hazard’s goal came in the 38th minute.\n\nMourinho’s first trick came before kick-off when huge jets of water started to cascade and the playing surface was drenched to the point the ball could actually be seen splashing in certain areas. The idea, plainly, was to slow down the game, though United did start brightly and moved the ball quickly during the early exchanges. Not long before Hazard stuck his shot between David de Gea’s legs, the possession statistics had flashed up that Chelsea had seen only 30% of the ball. Hazard’s goal arrived just at the point Stamford Bridge was starting to feel a little anxious.\n\nVan Gaal could be seen remonstrating with the fourth official, Craig Pawson, after the goal because he was convinced there had been a foul by John Terry in the buildup. It was rare to see the Dutchman in that finger-pointing pose but his anger would be more accurately directed at his players. Chris Smalling’s pass out of defence was the first problem, in keeping with a recurring theme when the centre-half is on the ball. Falcao had Terry closing in from behind and as soon as Chelsea’s captain came away with the ball the away team were vulnerable. Oscar’s backheel was measured perfectly to leave Hazard scampering into the penalty area and the Belgian drew De Gea out of his goal before slotting in his shot.\n\nChelsea had looked short of ideas until that point, attacking only sporadically despite the presence of the promising but raw Paddy McNair in United’s defence and a new round of injury issues affecting Van Gaal’s thinking. Luke Shaw’s surging runs from left-back were a prominent feature.\n\nAntonio Valencia had the same ambitions on the opposite side and, early on, Wayne Rooney really ought to have done better with one of Shaw’s cutbacks, managing only to hit the stanchion behind the goal. The chance fell to Rooney’s left foot and, for all his qualities, England’s captain rarely excels when the ball is on that side.\n\nChelsea stuck rigidly to their tactics once they had taken the lead, determined not to lose their shape and restricting themselves to counter-attacks. Drogba got away at one point and when his shot flicked off Smalling it looped over De Gea to drop at the far post. Hazard tried an improvisational hook-shot but could only turn a bouncing ball against the post. That apart, De Gea was seldom threatened.\n\nThe old Falcao might have buried the chance that came to him later on, after spinning away from Zouma, but Ander Herrera deserved his yellow card after flicking out his foot to try to manufacture a penalty from Gary Cahill’s challenge. The final whistle came soon afterwards and Chelsea celebrated like champions in waiting, however much their manager insisted he was taking nothing for granted."}, {"date": "13/04/2015", "arena":

in recent days, it proved too much for Newcastle United to stomach as their malaise deepened at Anfield. The Champions League may not be a pipe-dream for Brendan Rodgers’ team after all.\n\nLiverpool closed to within four points of fourth-placed Manchester City with an ultimately comfortable win courtesy of Sterling’s seventh league goal of the campaign and Joe Allen’s first. Footage of Sterling seeming to pass out having apparently taken nitrous oxide were a distraction to Rodgers in his post-match press conference but not his team’s revived pursuit of Champions League qualification.\n\nLiverpool were often careless in possession but always dangerous in attack and Sterling should really have finished on a hat-trick.\n\nJohn Carver witnessed signs of much-needed improvement from the visitors in a purposeful spell either side of the interval but it was not enough to prevent a fifth successive Premier League defeat. Newcastle’s defending continues to invite trouble, with Ryan Taylor, Gabriel Obertan and Mike Williamson found wanting for Liverpool’s two goals, and they will be without Moussa Sissoko for the next two games after the influential midfielder was sent off for a dreadful foul on Lucas Leiva.\n\nSissoko was dismissed for a second bookable offence by the referee, Lee Mason, who also denied Newcastle a clear penalty when Dejan Lovren impeded Ayoze Pérez in the first half, but the shin-high lunge was worthy of a straight red.\n\nNewcastle’s captain headed for the tunnel before Mason had pulled out the card.\n\n“The sending-off could have been a straight red,” admitted Carver. “I will be honest, I have said that to Moussa. I am quite straight and I won’t defend anyone if it is indefensible.\n\n“He got a two-match ban so we got away with one there but the pleasing thing is we have responded from that dreadful performance against Sunderland. We have got six cup finals because we need to get points.”\n\nRodgers had filed his programme notes before Manchester City’s defeat at Old Trafford offered unexpected opportunity to Liverpool. In them he cautioned that “the teams above us are not dropping points” but he was more emboldened about a Champions League place after this result. Liverpool were quick to establish a foothold over a brittle Newcastle. The performances of Philippe Coutinho and Sterling, forming a three-pronged attack alongside Jordon Ibe, ensured the injured Daniel Sturridge was not missed.\n\nCarver had pledged a reaction from Newcastle following their lame defeat in the Tyne-Wear derby last weekend and initially the “hurt” visitors delivered. Yet it underlined Newcastle’s weakness that they conceded when under pressure for the first time. The breakthrough was a moment to savour for the scrutinised Sterling.\n\nJordan Henderson instigated the ninth-minute goal with a crossfield pass that his England international colleague trapped with an exquisite first touch on the left of the visitors’ penalty area. Sterling stepped inside one weak challenge from Taylor, a second from Obertan and swept a fine right-footed finish beyond Tim Krul. It was the 20-year-old’s first goal since inviting criticism with his admission to the BBC that he had rejected a £100,000-a-week contract offer from Liverpool. Any concerns Sterling might have had over the Kop’s reaction were misplaced although the home supporters were quick to express an unflattering opinion of the player’s agent, Aidy Ward.\n\nLiverpool, wearing black armbands before the 26th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster on Wednesday, appeared on course for a comfortable victory in the immediate aftermath of Sterling’s goal as Newcastle’s resistance evaporated.\n\nBut the home side’s dominance proved deceptive. Having spent most of the first half justifying recent accusations of a lack of quality and fight, the visitors ended it in the ascendancy and rightly enraged by Mason’s refusal to award a penalty when Lovren fouled Pérez inside the Liverpool area.\n\nCarver, who continued his protest as the officials left the field at half-time, said: “The game hinged on a huge decision. I don’t want to be seen to be a moaner but it is a fact we don’t get big decisions for whatever reason. I have spoken to the referee but it doesn’t help me. Contracts, jobs and livelihoods rest on decisions like that.”\n\nPérez almost levelled with a flying header from Daryl Janmaat’s cross, only for Simon Mignolet to produce a fine save. Sterling should have scored his second when Taylor completely missed Henderson’s cross from the right and allowed the ball to reach the winger standing six yards in front of goal.\n\nSomehow Sterling side-footed his effort horribly wide. His blushes were spared by Allen of all people.\n\nNewcastle dealt comfortably with a Henderson corner from the right but not with the return ball back into their box by Emre Can. Can’s cross bounced off Williamson and, before the Newcastle central defender could react, Allen dispatched a snap-shot past Krul from close range.\n\nThe Wales international became the 18th different player to score for Liverpool this season with his first of the campaign, equalling a club record."}, {"date": "12/04/2015", "arena": "Kiyan Prince Foundation Stadium", "attendance": 17939,

Chelsea’s victorious players had gathered in front of the away support in the upper tier of the School end at the final whistle, punching the air in triumph as they celebrated the retention of a seven-point lead which has edged the Premier League title ever closer. While they rejoiced, their opponents dragged themselves from the turf in utter disbelief, the west London divide gaping wider than ever.\n\nQPR will have been numbed by this loss, all the optimism generated by an upturn in away form and 88 minutes of industry and aggression having been undone at the last. Rob Green’s sliced clearance from hand barely stretched 20 yards outside his penalty area for Eden Hazard, of all people, to collect and dart forward. The Belgian was permitted to exchange passes with Oscar, the home defence suddenly ramshackle, before pulling back for Cesc Fàbregas to place the game’s only goal inside the post. Chris Ramsey sank to his haunches, head in hands and agony etched across his face.\n\nThe implications for his team, still two points beneath the cut-off and facing a fortnight’s hiatus in their campaign, are grim. Chelsea’s pursuit of their own more glittering prize simply seems more relentless in the aftermath of a victory chiselled from an awkward and fractious occasion.\n\nJosé Mourinho admitted his team had been blessed with good fortune, prising the game’s decisive goal with their only shot on target. “I feel sorry for QPR because they worked so hard,” he said. “They didn’t let us play better and did their job very well. But every time I was a champion, I remember a couple of matches my team won in the last minute. A little light shines for the team that are going to be champions.”\n\nRoman Abramovich, up in the stand, was peering out through designer sunglasses with the implications of the result rather than the performance enough to have dazzled.\n\nThey may actually have gained more psychologically from a narrow late success in a derby than if they had stamped some authority on the contest early on and won comfortably. Fàbregas’ reward had actually been secured two minutes from time, the Spaniard removing the protective face mask – worn after a clash with Stoke’s Charlie Adam eight days earlier which had left him with a broken nose – as he raced to the corner, pursued by joyous team-mates.\n\nThose celebrations were interrupted as objects rained down upon them, Branislav Ivanovic struck on the neck by a cigarette lighter, with plastic bottles and coins among the other debris flung at them. “If somebody threw a pound, put the pound in your pocket and go,” Mourinho said. “If it’s a chocolate, eat it. No problem.” This was not a day to stoke further controversy; Chelsea had secured the reward that counted most of all.\n\nThey achieved their win despite being blunted, both by QPR’s eager energy and their own injury problems. Diego Costa remains hamstrung, while Loïc Rémy – formerly of these parts and a scorer of winning goals in his current team’s previous two matches – had succumbed to a “small injury” to his calf.\n\nThe hope is he will have returned to contention in time for the visit of Manchester United on Saturday, with another derby at second-placed Arsenal to follow. In that pair’s absence, Didier Drogba led the line at 37, his goal threat minimal even if the effort and commitment could never be questioned. Willian hit a post with a cross that caught in the wind, but the visitors carried little punch until Green’s slice offered relief.\n\nQPR were not afforded the same generosity by Thibaut Courtois. The Belgian had been beaten from 65 yards against Stoke but was back to his best here, his form confirmed by an instinctive save to deny Matt Phillips as the winger shot goalwards on the turn. “I’d told Thibaut that after Hull and Charlie Adam we needed him to give us a couple of points,” said Mourinho, “and he did that.” The home side must have feared the worst when that effort was saved, Courtois having already saved twice, from Charlie Austin and Clint Hill.\n\nThe home side had offered the more coherent threat, their menace built on the tigerish industry of Sandro and Joey Barton in central midfield, but the derby had been horribly scrappy on a scarred surface which suggested stalemate. “We’ve ended up devastated,” Barton said. “We still have a number of games and feel our destiny is in our hands, and if we play like that we will be fine. But you could see what it meant to Chelsea to win that game.”\n\nThe post-match celebrations were those of champions elect. The title creeps ever closer to a return to Stamford Bridge.\n\nMan of the match Joey Barton (QPR)"}, {"date": "12/04/2015", "arena": "Old Trafford", "attendance": 75313, "home_team": {"name": "Manchester United", "lineup": [{"name": "David De Gea", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Antonio Valencia", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Smalling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [73], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Jones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [75]}, {"name": "Daley Blind", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Carrick", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Juan Mata", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [67], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [81]}, {"name": "Ander Herrera", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marouane Fellaini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [27], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [83]}, {"name": "Ashley Young", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [14], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wayne Rooney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Rafael", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marcos Rojo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [75], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ángel di María", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [81], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Falcao", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [83], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adnan Januzaj", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Valdes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paddy McNair", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Manchester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Joe Hart", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pablo Zabaleta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Vincent Kompany", "yellows": [44], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Martín Demichelis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gael Clichy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jesus Navas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [74]}, {"name": "Yaya Touré", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fernandinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Silva", "yellows": [34], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Milner", "yellows": [24], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [63]}, {"name": "Sergio Agüero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [8, 89], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Fernando", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Samir Nasri", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [63], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Edin Dzeko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aleksandar Kolarov", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willy Caballero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Frank Lampard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [74], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eliaquim Mangala", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "These are the moments when it seems as if English football is getting the old Manchester United back. They have taken their time and there are still imperfections but finally they are operating with the dynamism, the exhilaration and sense of adventure that is supposed to be mandatory for any set of players who pull on their colours.\n\nThey played in a way that had Louis van Gaal announcing it was time for supporters to “go on the streets and hold their heads up” and they won with so much to spare it was difficult not to think Manuel Pellegrini’s position at Manchester City might have strayed dangerously close to irretrievable. This was City’s sixth defeat in eight matches and their manager increasingly sounds lost about what has gone wrong.\n\nNobody said it would be easy getting to the top of a sport and staying there but it is coming up for seven years since the money started pouring in from Abu Dhabi and City’s owners are entitled to expect better than four wins in 15 games.\n\nThe potential ramifications for Pellegrini are obvious but the real story here was of the re-emergence of one of the great forces. United were ruthless once they had shaken off the jolt of Sergio Agüero’s early goal. The plodding football we saw earlier in the season has been replaced by the old, thrilling excitement and the volume was turned high. Old Trafford, for the first time in a long time, seemed like a contented place.\n\nÁngel Di Maria and Radamel Falcao, the two players who were supposed to spearhead Van Gaal’s first season in charge, did not even set foot on the pitch until it was 4-1. Yet Van Gaal always did say the team’s structure was more important to him than selecting players based purely on their reputations and, slowly but surely, the evidence is being seen.\n\nWho could have thought, for example, that one of the forgotten men, Ashley Young, would hold this kind of influence when the superstars started arriving? Or that the coach who once led a brilliant, slick Ajax side to the European Cup would ever laud Marouane Fellaini’s ability to “play the ball to the same colour [shirt] every time”? Young and Fellaini have taken turns as the two players United’s crowd disliked the most. Yet Fellaini is now being acclaimed in a way that was once implausible while Young is playing with enough distinction that the watching England manager, Roy Hodgson, must be considering a recall.\n\nYoung started United’s recovery with their equaliser and his confidence could be measured in the moment when he subjected Pablo Zabaleta to a back-heeled nutmeg, shortly before setting up Fellaini to score the second.\n\nElsewhere Juan Mata was wonderful again, particularly when it came to those triangular passing moves with Ander Herrera and Antonio Valencia. All of these players have suffered at times during some of the more difficult periods at Old Trafford, post-Ferguson. All have been coaxed out of it.\n\nMore than that, this victory was also a demonstration of competitive courage bearing in mind the way the game started. City set off like a team in a hurry and Jesús Navas really ought to have scored even before James Milner and David Silva took advantage of slack marking to set up Agüero for the opening goal.\n\nThe problem for City was that the final whistle was still 82 minutes away. Zabaleta was at fault for United’s first two goals. Later it was Martín Demichelis’s turn when Mata made it 3-1 and Chris Smalling headed in the fourth. Silva was a frequent menace and at least Agüero is scoring again, adding a second late on for his first goals since 24 February.\n\nYet City have inexplicably dropped away from that point on New Year’s Day when they were joint-top with Chelsea. Vincent Kompany did not last beyond half-time because of recurring injury problems and it was another occasion when it seemed as though Yaya Touré’s heart was not in it.\n\nThe game started turning away from City after 14 minutes when David de Gea aimed a long clearance to the left, where Fellaini and Herrera had doubled up on Zabaleta. City were vulnerable as soon as Zabaleta lost his balance and, though Gaël Clichy was first to Herrera’s cross, the ball spun off his body and fell for Young to hook an improvised shot into the exposed net.\n\nCity, and Silva in particular, continued to move the ball at a speed that troubled their opponents but they had a raw edge. After 27 minutes Young slipped the ball through Zabaleta’s legs, then took it back from Daley Blind. Fellaini had made his way to the far post and had several inches on the nearest defender, Clichy, to head United into the lead.\n\nCity had legitimate complaints that Fellaini was fractionally offside, even if it was by little more than a few tufts of hair, and similar grievances about Mata’s starting position when Wayne Rooney played him in midway through the second half. Yet Pellegrini was more concerned about his team’s defending. Demichelis lost the ball to Fellaini in the build-up to Mata’s goal, leaving himself badly out of position as the Spaniard ran clear to clip his shot past Joe Hart.\n\nSix minutes later Demichelis did not follow Smalling’s run and the defender headed in Young’s free-kick to beat Hart again. United were rampant and Agüero’s late goal, from Zabaleta’s cutback, came almost in slow motion, with barely a flicker of celebration.\n\nMan of the match Ashley Young (Manchester United)"}, {"date":

succeeded in pleasing neither Roberto Martínez nor Garry Monk in this feisty encounter which belied the mid-table comfort Everton and Swansea currently enjoy.\n\nThe visitors had been on course for a fourth-straight win, thanks to Aaron Lennon’s second goal for the club four minutes before the interval, when Séamus Coleman conceded a penalty for handball after stumbling under pressure from the Swansea substitute Marvin Emnes.\n\nSouthampton 2-0 Hull City | Premier League match report Read more\n\nThe Republic of Ireland international clearly handled as he fell to the turf, having anticipated that Oliver would award him a free-kick following contact with Emnes, and looked up in horror as Oliver pointed to the spot and Jonjo Shelvey dispatched the penalty to earn Swansea a point they merited.\n\nMonk felt Oliver, who had infuriated the Swans manager earlier this season when awarding Victor Moses a penalty at Stoke, could have given the spot-kick for either the handball or Coleman forcing Emnes over as he surged around him. Martínez, unsurprisingly, did not agree.\n\nHe said: “Séamus felt there was contact. The defender gets in front, the striker is trying to get there. If you don’t press the brakes quick enough you are going to get some contact. The referee at that point needs to make a decision. Séamus loses his balance and as he falls he ends up touching the ball with his hand.\n\n“There was no goalscoring threat whatsoever. I think it was very harsh. The referee should have applied a bit of common sense. From my point of view, I would have wanted to see a free-kick awarded to us. Two or three actions straight after it were exactly the same and given as a free-kick. That is disappointing, you want some consistency. It is a huge punishment after a good performance.”\n\nBut Martínez could not argue Swansea did not deserve their share of the spoils as, motivated by their desire to secure a win which would see them surpass their previous highest Premier League points tally of 47, the hosts had the better of the opening half-hour.\n\nThe in-form striker Bafétimbi Gomis was lively, turning Phil Jagielka and forcing Tim Howard into an acrobatic save. Unfortunately for the Frenchman he tweaked a hamstring in the process and will undergo a scan to determine the severity of the problem.\n\nShelvey had the ball in the back of the net with a magnificent long-range volley, but the goal was chalked off, to Monk’s chagrin, by Oliver for a foul by Wayne Routledge on Leighton Baines.\n\nEverton took advantage of the let-off and, after Coleman had Lukasz Fabianski at full stretch with a low angled drive, they took the lead. James McCarthy and Arouna Koné exchanged passes down the left and when Ashley Williams missed the former’s cross, Lennon controlled and calmly finished.\n\nWest Ham United 1-1 Stoke City | Premier League match report Read more\n\nThe lead could have been greater had Steven Pienaar, on his first appearance in four months, put more power into a strike from a Koné lay-off or Fabianski not kept out Gareth Barry’s firm header.\n\nBut Swansea reasserted their authority, with Ki Sung-yueng firing over having beaten Barry with a lovely piece of skill, before the penalty arrived and Shelvey earned them a point to move level on their 47-point target.\n\nIt left Monk rueing Shelvey’s disallowed strike, while also questioning why Oliver did not send off Koné, rather than book the forward, for an aerial challenge on Federico Fernández in the first half.\n\nHe said: “I thought with the [Koné] challenge on Federico in the air, you see players get sent off for less than that. I thought he was lucky. But I was more disappointed with the disallowed goal. I thought it was very harsh, it was a soft free-kick, on what could have been one of the goals of the season.”"}, {"date": "11/04/2015", "arena": " Mary's Stadium", "attendance": 30359, "home_team": {"name": "Southampton", "lineup": [{"name": "Kelvin Davis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Toby Alderweireld", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "José Fonte", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Maya Yoshida", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Bertrand", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Wanyama", "yellows": [42], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Morgan Schneiderlin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shane Long", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [74]}, {"name": "Steven Davis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sadio Mané", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [61]}, {"name": "Graziano Pellè", "yellows": [33], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [81], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Nathaniel Clyne", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dusan Tadic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [61], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Ward-Prowse", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [56], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eljero Elia", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [74], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paulo Gazzaniga", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harrison Reed", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matt Targett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Hull City", "lineup": [{"name": "Steve Harper", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Chester", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [64]}, {"name": "Michael Dawson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex Bruce", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paul McShane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ahmed Elmohamady", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jake Livermore", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Huddlestone", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [74]}, {"name": "Stephen Quinn", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dame N'Doye", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sone Aluko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [84]}], "subs": [{"name": "Allan McGregor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Liam Rosenior", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Abel Hernandez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [84], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robbie Brady", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mohamed Diamé", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [64], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yannick Sagbo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [74], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andrew Robertson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Two Southampton players ended torturous waits here and, in so doing, deepened’s Hull’s anxiety.

The Irishman spared his former club by rounding Harper with a hefty touch that took the ball out of play.\n\nThat start suggested trouble for Hull but, in fact, they composed themselves quickly and began to unsettle their hosts. The visitors emerged as the superior team in a scruffy first period and caused problems to a home defence in which Toby Alderweireld played at right-back rather than Nathaniel Clyne, with the manager Ronald Koeman claiming the England defender was omitted because of fatigue rather than his reluctance to sign a new contract amid speculation of a transfer bid from a top-four club.\n\nHull’s bright start was betrayed by weak finishing. Sone Aluko dragged a shot wide from 15 yards in the second minute and was denied four minutes later by a good save from Kelvin Davis.\n\nSouthampton’s chances of clinching a Champions League spot may have receded in recent weeks but Koeman has made it clear that qualifying for the Europa League would be a thrill for a club that have not competed on the continent since 2003-04. He was angered by his team’s meekness in the first half. “It took a long time to recognise my team,” he said. “It was looking nervous. If you fight for relegation you have to be nervous, but if you fight for something special in a season, why are you nervous?”\n\nKoeman sought to stimulate improvement by replacing Victor Wanyama with Ward-Prowse at the break. But the visitors almost took the lead in the 54th minute, when Jake Livermore let fly from the edge of the area. Davis made a superb one-handed save.\n\nTwo minutes later Southampton took the lead thanks partially to a reckless tackle in the box by Alex Bruce on Long. Ward-Prowse slammed in the penalty, but only after Koeman told captain José Fonte to intervene to make sure that Sadio Mané did not take it, the Senegalese having grabbed the ball off the youngster. “Prowsey was accepting [Mané’s claim] and I don’t understand that because he knows he’s first choice,” said Koeman. “It was a difficult decision [to intervene] but that’s the problem of Mané. Rules in the team are more important.”\n\nWest Bromwich Albion 2-3 Leicester City | Premier League match report Read more\n\nHull, who had failed to score in 13 of their previous 23 matches, needed to sharpen up. They laboured hard but there was little sign of their toil bearing fruit. James Chester met a corner with a firm header but Ryan Bertrand whacked it off the line. Hull’s hopes were dashed nine minutes from time. It was no consolation to them that on this occasion it took a slick move to undo them.\n\nAfter snazzy interplay Morgan Schneiderlin fed Pellè, who swept the ball gratefully into the net from close range. The Italian’s joy and relief were palpable. But Bruce had cause to be angry that the striker was still on the pitch, arguing that Pellè should have been sent off rather than merely booked for a first-half foul that left Alex Bruce with a broken nose. “He’s got away with one there because he has smashed him around the chops with his forearm and from what I’ve seen from the DVD, he’s done it deliberately,” said Bruce.\n\nBruce also bemoaned his side’s familiar bluntness up front, but insisted his team can avoid relegation despite a fearsome-looking fixture list. “We created chances but we didn’t take them and therein lies our problem,” said Bruce. “But if we take those chances, I’m still convinced we’ve got enough to stay in this league.”\n\n• This article was amended on 11 April 2015 to reflect the fact Southampton played in the

Sunderland he ended the afternoon ashen-faced and speaking of deep hurt. It was late December and a fourth straight defeat against his then north-east neighbours quite possibly helped provoke the Newcastle United manager’s defection to Crystal Palace in the new year.\n\nPardew’s Palace gameplan here was devised with revenge in mind but even he could not have dared to dream it would precipitate such a near-perfect second half. Thanks to a hat-trick from the fabulous Yannick Bolasie, Palace’s impressive ascent of the table continued as a thoroughly chastened Sunderland were reminded that their latest skirmish with relegation is far from over.\n\nTottenham Hotspur 0-1 Aston Villa | Premier League match report Read more\n\nWell before the end the ground had largely emptied but those who remained to the bitter end booed Dick Advocaat’s side off at the end of a day which began deceptively brightly for the home team.\n\nBy tea-time, though, Sunderland’s limitations had been thoroughly exposed by the pace, movement and sheer workrate of a Palace side apparently reborn under Pardew’s tutelage.\n\n“Excellent,” he said. “We were almost unplayable in the second half. No disrespect to Sunderland but the scoreline slightly flatters them. We’re a dangerous team and our front quartet were irresistible at times.”\n\nIt might, just might, have been a little different had Lee Cattermole not picked up a typically silly first-half booking for pulling back Bolasie. Fresh from thoroughly subduing Moussa Sissoko in last Sunday’s 1-0 win against Newcastle United, Cattermole had started by scything into tackles, calibrating Sunderland’s passing and surging deep into opposition territory.\n\nIf only he was a little more disciplined at times Cattermole would surely be in the England squad. This enduring flaw in his make-up dictated that few were surprised when, partway through the first half, he collected his latest yellow card in the wake of Bolasie dispossessing him.\n\nIt was no coincidence that Cattermole – later replaced by Liam Bridcutt as his frustration threatened to boil over – needing to watch his step prefaced a marked improvement on Palace’s part. Goodness knows what might have happened had the referee not looked leniently on Jack Rodwell when he lunged in on James McArthur, Anthony Taylor merely booking Sunderland’s midfielder rather than issuing an arguably deserved red card.\n\nIf the first-half flow was hardly helped by far too many niggly fouls, the reasons for Advocaat to worry were gradually mounting. No matter that 43 minutes had passed before Steven Fletcher’s volley produced the first shot on target, Bolasie and Jason Puncheon were stretching the Dutchman’s defence while Pardew’s backline had succeeded in isolating Jermain Defoe.\n\nDeceivingly, in Costel Pantilimon’s most notable first-half moment the home goalkeeper received a bloody nose after a Scott Dann challenge but far worse was to follow for the Romanian.\n\nThe second half had barely begun before Pantilimon was picking the ball out of the net after being beaten by Glenn Murray’s header in the wake of Bolasie’s cross being helpfully deflected to the far post.\n\nWest Bromwich Albion 2-3 Leicester City | Premier League match report Read more\n\nWith Santiago Vergini and John O’Shea suddenly succumbing to some alarming wobbles, Sunderland appeared to have regressed to their bad old selves. During the interval Pardew had presumably instructed Wilfried Zaha to target Patrick Van Aanholt because, by now, Advocaat’s previously assured left back was struggling horribly too.\n\nSunderland fell further behind when Murray flicked on a long diagonal pass and Bolasie squeezed a shot between Pantilimon’s legs. Their surrender was confirmed when another punt forward concluded with the game’s outstanding individual holding off O’Shea before showing off stellar technique in chipping the keeper.\n\nThe Ireland centre-half’s misery deepened when Murray bullied him out of possession, permitting Bolasie to round Pantilimon and complete a richly deserved hat-trick. No matter that Bolasie stumbled as he shaped to shoot, Advocaat’s defence proved powerless to prevent the scorer recovering, extending his right boot and watching the ball hit the back of the net once again.\n\nWith Connor Wickham’s late volleyed goal offering Sunderland no consolation, Pardew assumed centre stage at the final whistle, striding on to the pitch and saluting Palace’s rightly ecstatic travelling support.\n\n“I don’t like to criticise players but that was not defending of the highest order, we couldn’t handle Palace’s pace,” said Advocaat. “We didn’t create chances, none at all. That’s a concern when you play with three strikers. We must improve. I knew when I started it would be very difficult but it’s clear some players are playing at their limit.”"}, {"date": "11/04/2015", "arena": "White Hart Lane", "attendance": 35687, "home_team": {"name": "Tottenham Hotspur", "lineup": [{"name": "Michel Vorm", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Vlad Chiriches", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [79]}, {"name": "Federico Fazio", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eric Dier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Rose", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Mason", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nabil Bentaleb", "yellows": [66], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andros Townsend", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [79]}, {"name": "Nacer Chadli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [62]}, {"name": "Christian Eriksen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Kane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Paulinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Roberto Soldado", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [62], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Erik Lamela", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [79], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "DeAndre Yedlin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [79], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Brad Friedel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Benjamin Stambouli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Davies", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Aston Villa", "lineup": [{"name": "Brad Guzan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leandro Bacuna", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ron Vlaar", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ciaran Clark", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [18]}, {"name": "Kieran  Richardson", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Cleverley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Carlos Sánchez", "yellows": [58], "reds": [90], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fabian Delph", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gabriel Agbonlahor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [70]}, {"name": "Christian Benteke", "yellows": [81], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [35], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Grealish", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [63]}], "subs": [{"name": "Nathan Baker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [18], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jores Okore", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andreas Weimann", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [63], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Cole", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [70], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charles N'Zogbia", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shay Given", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matthew Lowton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "The supply teacher returned and he had his revenge. Tim Sherwood had the last laugh. The final whistle blew, there was a wave towards the directors’ box, he shook Mauricio Pochettino’s hand, and then he was marching off towards the jubilant Aston Villa supporters in the away end.\n\nSherwood, needless to say, was determined to enjoy every minute. A few Tottenham Hotspur supporters threw some abuse his way as he walked down the tunnel and Sherwood pumped a fist in their direction. He will rank this victory over the club that sacked him last year as the most enjoyable one of his short managerial career and it must have been uncomfortable viewing for Daniel Levy, Tottenham’s chairman.\n\nThis was a tactical and motivational triumph for Sherwood. He outmanoeuvred Pochettino, Villa were the more accomplished side, and defeat for Tottenham means their season is in danger of petering out. “It is difficult to fight for the top four,” Pochettino said. “We need to be realistic.”\n\nWhile Tottenham were lowering their sights to the Europa League, Villa were taking another giant stride towards securing their Premier League status. The only blow for Sherwood is that Gabriel Agbonlahor and Ciaran Clark picked up injuries that may rule them out of the FA Cup semi-final against Liverpool next Sunday, while Carlos Sanchez will be suspended at Wembley after his late red card.\n\nYet Villa can worry about that later. This was their first victory at White Hart Lane since 2008 and the identity of their goalscorer was not a surprise. Christian Benteke has been revitalised under Sherwood and he followed up his hat-trick in last Tuesday’s 3-3 draw with Queens Park Rangers by scoring the winner here. It was his eighth goal in his past six matches.\n\nThe result rarely looked in doubt once Benteke headed Villa into the lead after 34 minutes, although Sherwood was at his wits’ end after Sanchez was shown his second yellow card for scything down Danny Rose in stoppage time. Tempers threatened to boil over and there was a fracas on the pitch, while Sherwood’s assistant, Tony Parks, had to be held back as he tried to confront one of the Tottenham coaches.\n\nThe afternoon began pleasantly enough. It was like a scene from the red carpet when Sherwood emerged, a mass of photographers huddled around the tunnel in the moments before kick-off, waiting for the grand entrance. He smiled, slapped hands with a member of Tottenham’s backroom staff and found his seat in the dug-out.\n\nWere Tottenham guilty of allowing themselves to become distracted by the Sherwood sideshow? Quite possibly. Their defence was nervy without Jan Vertonghen, who was missing because of illness, and it soon became clear that Benteke and Agbonlahor believed that they could expose Tottenham’s vulnerabilities.\n\nThe warning signs were there for Tottenham when Vlad Chiriches, who was deputising at right-back for Kyle Walker, failed to clear his lines three times in the space of a minute. This was an ordeal for Chiriches, whose confidence is so low that even the most basic tasks were beyond him. The home fans groaned whenever the ball went near the Romanian, Benteke often pulled away to the left to unsettle him, and Villa’s opener came after he conceded possession cheaply inside his own half.\n\nTom Cleverley sprayed a pass out to Leandro Bacuna on the right and his cross was met by Benteke, who took advantage of slack marking to elude Eric Dier and Federico Fazio, before guiding a low header into the far corner. The ball bounced into the net off the inside of the right post and Michel Vorm could only stand and watch as it went past him.\n\nVilla could have been out of sight by the break. Agbonlahor burst past the unconvincing Fazio and his shot from the edge of the area struck the left post.\n\nTottenham were creaking. Sherwood used a diamond in midfield, with Sanchez in the screening role and Jack Grealish at the tip of it, and Fabian Delph and Cleverley dominated. Christian Eriksen struggled to find space for Tottenham and Villa were not affected when Clark limped off with a knee injury after a collision with Fazio.\n\nNathan Baker replaced Clark and he performed commendably alongside Ron Vlaar. Villa’s centre-backs kept Harry Kane, Tottenham’s captain, unusually quiet.\n\nDanny Rose had Tottenham’s best chance, but Guzan denied him with his feet, and it was a day to forget for Pochettino’s side. There was no spark. They lacked ideas and appear to have run out of steam.\n\nThey did muster a couple of threatening moments after the break, Rose seeing a shot deflected wide and Kane bending an effort over, but Delph should have wrapped up the points when he ran clear near the end. He could not beat Vorm, however, and Villa steeled themselves for a frantic finale.\n\nYet they were stout. Vlaar was the game’s outstanding performer and Guzan did not have to make a serious save in the Villa goal.\n\nSherwood turned a deep shade of green when the fourth official’s board showed five minutes of stoppage time, but the celebrations were not far away.\n\nWest Bromwich Albion 2-3 Leicester City | Premier League match report Read more"}, {"date": "11/04/2015", "arena": "The Hawthorns",

minute, Jamie Vardy gave Leicester City a massive boost in their battle to stay in the Premier League thanks to a stunning breakaway goal two minutes into added time that draws West Bromwich Albion deeper into the scrap. Suddenly the gap to safety is three points and with a favourable run-in, Nigel Pearson’s team could well stay up.\n\nJust as the game seemed to be petering out to a draw, Vardy robbed a dawdling Gareth McAuley of possession near halfway and drove forward before finding the bottom left corner of Boaz Myhill’s goal. The away end exploded with joy, the boos from the home fans magnified the increasing fears that Tony Pulis’s side are too facing a battle to the end.\n\n“It’s an exceptional goal,” Pearson said. “But we can’t get carried away. It’s great to get back-to-back wins but we’ve got an awful lot to do.” Five of their remaining seven games are at home and Chelsea are the only top-six side left to face. Pearson continued to play their chances down, though. “Ultimately we’ve got to do it ourselves. It’s a big ask.”\n\nWest Brom, who remain seven points above the bottom three but face a daunting set of fixtures that includes the top three and Liverpool, had designated this fixture Jeff Astle Day, in memory of the striker who died from chronic traumatic encephalopathy in 2002. The Albion players wore a commemorative kit in honour of the 1968 FA Cup winner, numbered from 1-11 even though Darren Fletcher donned 11 in centre midfield, and the now customary ovation in the ninth minute was particularly moving with a mosaic at the Brummie End displaying the simple message: “Astle King”.\n\nBy that point, the hosts were in front courtesy of Fletcher and the goal decision system, after the captain arrived at the near post to head Chris Brunt’s corner home. Kasper Schmeichel’s flap could not keep it out and despite the attempts of Esteban Cambiasso to clear off the line, Martin Atkinson checked his technology and signalled that the ball had crossed fully.\n\nCambiasso was integral as Leicester regained parity with their first chance of note in the 20th minute, though, as his free-kick from a defensive position was knocked down by Leonardo Ulloa and David Nugent brushed off Craig Dawson before tucking the ball neatly past Myhill.\n\nThey were only level for eight minutes, however. Chris Brunt’s whipped cross from the left was only half-cleared by Jeffrey Schlupp, under pressure from Brown Ideye, and Craig Gardner, left all alone near the penalty spot, acrobatically sent the rebound into Schmeichel’s bottom left corner via a Wes Morgan deflection.\n\nLeicester finished the half strongly and Ulloa spurned a glorious chance three minutes before the break when blazing over from eight yards following a cute header from Nugent.\n\nPearson brought Marcin Wasilewski in for Ritchie De Laet at the interval, a move which allowed Schlupp, who started at left-back, licence to roam forward, but it was on the opposite flank where Leicester looked more likely to penetrate. Marc Albrighton cut in front in from the right shortly after the hour only for his goal-bound effort to divert for a corner off Lescott’s outstretched leg.\n\nTottenham Hotspur 0-1 Aston Villa | Premier League match report Read more\n\nWest Brom invited the pressure on. They looked agitated and rushed in possession, typified by Brunt banishing what should have been a simple pass across the field into the stands with 20 minutes to go.\n\nLeicester sensed an opportunity and began piling forward. Riyad Mahrez sent a free-kick over, Morgan headed tamely wide from a Cambiasso corner before they finally made it 2-2 with a shade more than 10 minutes remaining. Again it came from a clever Cambiasso dead-ball. Instead of pumping a corner in, he spotted Albrighton unmarked on the left edge of the box and played it short to the winger. Albrighton fizzed into the back post, Nugent hooked across the face of goal, Wasilewski headed on and Robert Huth was on hand to add the finishing touch.\n\nThe final 10 minutes were frenetic and Schlupp had genuine claims for a penalty turned down after being bundled over by Dawson. But then it was Vardy time. He pick-pocketed McAuley on halfway, raced forward and after bamboozling Lescott, sent a low finish across goal and in. “Gareth was playing like a right-winger,” Pulis said, the anxiety creeping in. “You can’t do that at this level. It’s really disappointing.”"}, {"date": "11/04/2015", "arena": "Upton Park", "attendance": 34946, "home_team": {"name": "West Ham United", "lineup": [{"name": "Adrián", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Carl Jenkinson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Collins", "yellows": [21], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Winston Reid", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Cresswell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [7], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex Song", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [68]}, {"name": "Mark Noble", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cheikhou Kouyaté", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stewart Downing", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Diafra Sakho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [59]}, {"name": "Enner Valencia", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [78]}], "subs": [{"name": "Kevin Nolan", "yellows": [80], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [68], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matthew Jarvis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nene", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joey O'Brien", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Morgan Amalfitano", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [78], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jussi Jaaskelainen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Carlton Cole", "yellows": [85], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [59], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Stoke City", "lineup": [{"name": "Asmir Begovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Geoff Cameron", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Shawcross", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Philipp Wollscheid", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marc Wilson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [49]}, {"name": "Glenn Whelan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [67]}, {"name": "Steven N'Zonzi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marko Arnautovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [90], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charlie Adam", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Moses", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [44]}, {"name": "Jon Walters", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Phil Bardsley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Erik Pieters", "yellows": [73], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [49], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stephen Ireland", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [67], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mame Biram Diouf", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [44], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steve Sidwell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Butland", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Peter Crouch", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Sam Allardyce lamented West Ham’s “nerves and panic” that allowed Stoke to snatch an equaliser deep into stoppage time. The home side looked to have done enough to battle to victory after taking an early lead through a superb free-kick by the full-back Aaron Cresswell.\n\nBut after seeing two efforts from Marko Arnautovic ruled out for offside and a header by the substitute Mame Diouf hit the post, the visitors snatched a deserved point five minutes into injury time when the Austrian forward crashed the ball into the far corner.\n\nWest Ham remain in the top 10 but Allardyce knows their position should have been much more comfortable after witnessing yet another late capitulation.\n\n“You have to give Stoke a bit of credit but from our point of view we did not play as well as we can,” said Allardyce, who revealed striker Diafra Sakho is set for a spell on the sidelines with a thigh injury.\n\n“It was not about us playing well or not, it was about winning and we had got ourselves into a fantastic position. When you are less than 30 seconds away from winning the game and you don’t, that is the ultimate blow.\n\n“We are very nervous on that stage based on what happened before. We should be on 50 points now, we have thrown away seven points in two minutes or less over four games.\n\n“We can’t find the right key elements to see the game out and leave ourselves on a nervous edge by having a little bit of panic in what we are trying to do which is coping with the opposition when they have to take more risks, playing more direct.\n\n“While it was a very good goal, we should have dealt with it and kept possession better, using your intelligence to make sure you are doing it.”\n\nAllardyce added: “If we had concentrated better in those (last) minutes, we would be sitting on our greatest total and finish ever in the (Premier) League.\n\n“Instead we are scratching our heads on when are we going to finish a game out again. I thought we were going to do it today, but finished miserably in the end over just a few seconds.”\n\nAllardyce is out of contract in the summer, with the club’s owners yet to decide in which direction they want to take West Ham before their move to the Olympic Stadium.\n\nThe 60-year-old, though, intends to remain professional in his approach over the final matches of a campaign which had earlier promised so much.“It depends on what you say. Do you say what is the overall season like? It should be 50 points, it should be very, very good. It is small margins of victories to draws and draws to defeat,” Allardyce said.\n\n“In the judgment at the end of the season, or if not what happens before that, then we talk about what we are doing going forwards. We are still on course to beat the best points record we have had, but we are making it hugely difficult for ourselves now when we really should be coasting instead of looking forward to every game we are playing.”\n\nThe Senegal forward Sakho limped off in the second half and if the problem proves serious, he might not recover before the end of the campaign.\n\nAllardyce said: “If it is a grade one off the scan, then it could be two to three weeks, if it is more, then you would be lucky to see him again this season, which is a massive blow but we have to deal with it.”\n\nMark Hughes felt Stoke had done more than enough to end a run of three defeats. “We are thankful for small mercies because we did not think we were going to get what we deserved,” he said.\n\n“I thought we totally dominated the game and should have won it by a country mile. We had the setback from the great free-kick early in the game and it is difficult when you are the away side to come back.\n\n“We showed great resilience and stuck at it, trying to create things, but just lacked that bit of quality at the top end.\n\n“If one of our disallowed goals had counted I think we would still have had time to go on and win the game. We want to better last season’s total and are determined now to get something out of all of the matches we have left,” Hughes said. PA\n\nAaron Cresswell scores for West Ham.

winning run and cut Chelsea’s lead to four points, at least until Sunday afternoon, leaving Burnley hoping to prosper against more amenable opponents in their bid for Premier League survival.\n\nDefeats for Sunderland and Hull before the game kicked off had given Burnley the chance to make a giant leap with a win. Due to Sunderland in particular throwing away their goal-difference advantage, three points for the Clarets would have allowed Sean Dyche’s side to escape the bottom three altogether and reach the dizzy heights of 16th, which would have represented their best position this season.\n\nTottenham Hotspur 0-1 Aston Villa | Premier League match report Read more\n\nThe only snag was that beating Arsenal has become rather difficult of late. Tottenham were the last side to do it in the league and since that defeat in February the Gunners had posted an impressive seven consecutive wins. Burnley’s challenge was to somehow break that sequence – a draw would not have propelled them so far up the table though it would have been more than acceptable – but on Grand National day there was never much chance of an upset. By the end of the evening Arsenal were still the form team of the Premier League and Burnley were still in trouble. Dyche had no complaints. “Arsenal are a fine side and we only really went at them in the second half,” the Burnley manager said. “The only real disappointment was the way we conceded. We have been good lately at keeping the back door shut.”\n\nSam Vokes had an early chance snuffed out by David Ospina from David Jones’ alert through-ball, though Burnley did not make the best of starts. From the outset Arsenal kept them pushed back in their own half, moving the ball slickly around the edge of the penalty area, and the amount of time and space Alexis Sánchez was finding was ominous. Jason Shackell increased the pressure on his own defence after 11 minutes with an attempted clearance that only found an Arsenal player and though Tom Heaton was able to beat away Sánchez’s shot cum cross from the left yellow shirts were queuing up for the loose ball on the six-yard line. Mesut Özil had a try but could not find a way through before Ramsey collected the rebound and found the net.\n\nBurnley could not gain sufficient control of midfield to play the game further up the pitch, though Kieran Trippier did produce a splendid diving save from Ospina with a well-struck free-kick from 20 yards out after Laurent Koscielny had fouled Ashley Barnes. Arsenal can strike from set pieces themselves and Santi Cazorla was not far away with a curling effort when Sánchez won a free kick on the edge of the area. The visitors were winning too many free-kicks around the area for the home fans’ liking and when Olivier Giroud went to ground twice in quick succession the crowd registered displeasure both with Arsenal’s gamesmanship and Mike Dean’s refereeing.\n\nSánchez joined in on the stroke of the interval, going down far too easily on the left touchline and provoking the Burnley fans once again so that the half ended with boos and cries of “cheats”. Burnley were probably relieved to turn round just one goal down. Arsenal had not created many chances, content simply to keep possession and play within themselves after taking the lead, fairly confident that the home side would not mount any sustained attacks while being penned back in their own half.\n\nBarnes brought a routine save from Ospina early in the second half, after Shackell had headed down from a corner, before Sánchez brought a smarter one from Tom Heaton with a low shot from the edge of the area that threatened to curl inside the goalkeeper’s right-hand upright. The second half was not proving quite as one-sided as the first, however. Though Koscielny blocked a couple of hopeful efforts from Vokes and Danny Ings without too much difficulty Burnley were getting closer to the Arsenal goal, taking up the sort of positions from where a defensive mistake or a moment of inspiration might have led to an equaliser.\n\nIngs almost supplied the inspiration in the 65th minute with a determined run past a couple of defenders in the penalty area only to find he could not shake off Nacho Monreal. When Ben Mee comprehensively beat Héctor Bellerin on the right to steal into the area and cross George Boyd failed to apply his usual reliable touch in the middle, and after Ings attempted an overhead kick from close to the penalty spot he kept his shot on target but could not summon the power to trouble Ospina.\n\nArsenal were concerned enough to send on Danny Welbeck for the labouring Giroud, along with Özil an almost negligible threat after the interval. While the visitors could not score another goal they did raise their game sufficiently to push Burnley back again and there were even a couple of half-chances for Welbeck and Cazorla in the closing stages. Not Arsenal at their classiest, indeed by their standards they were quite wasteful, but as their fans enjoyed chanting at the end, one-nil is never to be sneezed at.\n\nChelsea are next, after a short break for the FA Cup semi-final against Reading, and if Arsenal win that they will equal their longest winning sequence from their invincible season. Not that supporters will care about that. Beat Chelsea and the fans might start singing about winning the league again, not just going to Wembley. Arsène Wenger is not getting carried away.\n\n“It’s still in Chelsea’s hands, even if we put in a perfect run,” the Arsenal manager said. “But we will give absolutely everything to finish in a strong way.”"}, {"date": "07/04/2015", "arena": "Villa Park", "attendance": 33708, "home_team": {"name": "Aston Villa", "lineup": [{"name": "Brad Guzan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals":

have run out of legs but this battle to avoid relegation is promising to provide ample compensation. Christian Benteke scored a hat-trick to lift Aston Villa three points above the basement zone just when it appeared Charlie Austin’s 17th goal of the season had earned Queens Park Rangers a second win in four days in the West Midlands to climb clear.\n\nVilla remain the lowest scorers in the division but under Tim Sherwood they have rediscovered their attacking mojo, no one more so than Benteke, whose equalising free-kick seven minutes from time was his seventh goal in his last five games. “It doesn’t get much better than that,” the Villa manager said in appreciation of his talisman.\n\nSherwood endured mixed emotions on his reunion with Chris Ramsey, his opposite number in the dugout and longstanding coaching colleague, and now faces another homecoming as Villa visit Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday before their FA Cup semi-final at Wembley. At least life is no longer dull at Villa.\n\nQPR had lost 13 out of 14 games under Ramsey before winning four miles across Birmingham on Saturday at West Bromwich Albion and they must have believed they had chalked up another victory when Austin put them 3-2 up in the 78th minute. How that would have put pep in their boots before Sunday’s derby with champions elect Chelsea.\n\nSherwood and Ramsey embraced on the touchline before kick-off as they briefly acknowledged a friendship that had to be put on hold because of the significance of this match. By the end they could afford to renew good relations but it was the Villa manager who could afford to smile more, keeping a rival beneath them, even though he thought a boxing referee would have ended the fight at half-time, so dominant were Villa at that stage.\n\nRamsey could claim a tactical coup as his switch from 4-4-2 to 3-5-2 early in the second half helped turn the game QPR’s way, Armand Traoré coming on to offer pace on the left flank as Matt Phillips stayed very wide on the right and it was the former Wycombe Wanderers flyer who added to his opener by making QPR’s two second-half goals.\n\nIn four successive visits to Villa Park, QPR have taken the lead and failed to win. So perhaps the home side should not have panicked unduly when Phillips dived to head in Bobby Zamora’s cross from the left edge of the box in the seventh minute. But the manner in which Villa’s nervy back four failed to deal with Austin’s initial right-wing centre was evidence of the edginess pervading both sets of players defensively.\n\nSherwood unzipped his jacket at this disappointment. Within three minutes, he was throwing it to the ground in unbridled jubilation as Villa equalised. Benteke probably could not believe how much freedom he was allowed as his goals turned the game on its head by half-time.\n\nThe Belgian looked marginally offside as he ran on to Fabian Delph’s pass down the left wing. Mauricio Isla looked simply terrified as he allowed Benteke to cut back inside on to his favoured right foot as they entered the penalty area and strike a shot that deflected up off the Chilean defender and over Robert Green into the far corner of the net.\n\nVilla, cheered on wildly by Stan Collymore in the press box, proceeded to pepper the Rangers goal. Ron Vlaar, back after six weeks out with a calf injury, hammered a shot that nigh on knocked out Sandro. Gabriel Agbonlahor was hauled back by Clint Hill as the striker rolled his man going into the penalty area. Benteke saw his header from Leandro Bacuna’s cross deflected just wide but the dam had to burst.\n\nCarlos Sánchez won a crucial tackle against Niko Kranjcar on the edge of the Villa penalty area for Agbonlahor to nick the ball into the QPR half just as Sandro took him out. Benteke rampaged forwards and, turning inside the hapless Hill, calmly dinked home.\n\nThe interval came at the right time for QPR, who not only had a chance to regroup but soon to reshape. With Karl Henry introduced as a third central midfielder, the wing-backs stretched the game with pace and width and, when this yielded a corner in the 55th minute, Hill headed in Phillips’ delivery for his first goal in 20 months.\n\nThen came the breathtaking ending. Austin thought he had won it for QPR with a superb right-footed finish at the near post after a brilliant first touch to control Phillips’ pull-back, only for Benteke to equalise five minutes later with a memorable free-kick that swerved in off a post after Hill had tripped Charles N’Zogbia."}, {"date": "06/04/2015", "arena": "Selhurst Park", "attendance": 24718, "home_team": {"name": "Crystal

that erupted in this corner of south London. Manuel Pellegrini’s team are nine points from Chelsea and will limp into Sunday’s derby at Old Trafford after three successive away league defeats and languishing in fourth. The manager is in denial if he thinks his own position will not come under more scrutiny than ever in the weeks ahead.\n\nThat their ambitions have now in effect switched from hoisting silverware to securing an automatic Champions League place, without the need for a qualifying round in August, is damning. Yet that is the grim reality. This campaign has unravelled and, while they could justifiably depart here bemoaning the non-award of a second-half penalty and even disputing the validity of Crystal Palace’s opening goal, this was all too frenzied and untidy for comfort. The visitors pummelled 22 shots from their monopoly of possession but they ended up beaten by “diligence, character, resilience”, qualities rattled off by Alan Pardew through a deadpan that suggested he had been left exhausted even in victory.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Alan Pardew praises Glenn Murray after victory over Manchester City.\n\nHe could afford to admire the displays delivered by his strong-arm centre-halves, excellent goalkeeper, workaholic midfield and a centre-forward in Glenn Murray whose nomadic career has taken in spells from Workington to Wilmington Hammerheads, Barrow to Brighton. Vincent Kompany and Martín Demichelis never truly nullified his nuisance value, outwitted as they were by canny centre-forward play.\n\nA fifth goal in as many top-flight appearances was window dressing to Murray’s all-round display. He also claimed the free-kick from Fernandinho from which Jason Puncheon doubled the hosts lead early in the second half but, deep down, City will know they should not be made to feel diminished by 31-year-old journeymen enjoying Indian summers to careers spent largely in the lower divisions.\n\nThis, like the defeat to Burnley in their previous Premier League trip, may end up illustrating the scale of reinvigoration required in the summer ahead. Only two of City’s outfield starters here were under 29 and one of those, Kompany, chalks up that landmark on Friday. They were busy enough in possession, pinging their passes with menace around the Palace penalty area, but only four of that huge tally of shots tested Julián Speroni. One he blocked from David Silva with his shoulder, another from Sergio Agüero with his outstretched right hand. James McArthur hacked another from Fernandinho away from under the crossbar, and Murray had choked the midfielder’s earlier effort with his right hand, unnoticed by the referee.\n\nYet it still felt vaguely surprising when Yaya Touré shrugged himself from his own fitful display – occasionally at his brutish best, just as often rather sluggish, and nothing like the player who rampaged in this arena as City all but claimed the title last April – to fizz in a riposte 12 minutes from time, but there was to be no relief at the end. Pellegrini mumbled through his post-match assessments, questioning how his team had lost. “But with the way we played, we must win this game,” he insisted as if trying to convince himself.\n\nHe was right in the sense there were periods when Palace creaked under the weight of the pressure, sitting so deep the penalty area was starved of oxygen, but it still felt a familiar kind of City loss. Turf Moor and Selhurst Park have claimed six points from their title defence.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Manuel Pellegrini denies his job is on the line after losing to Crystal Palace.\n\nPalace can rejoice, now convinced of safety, at the prospect of ruffling feathers at this level again next term. Pardew’s impact has been staggering. Tony Pulis inherited a more crestfallen team last season but the new incumbent took over a side in the bottom three and has secured 22 points from 11 matches. This was a different kind of win to savour, with the free-spirited wingers Wilfried Zaha and Yannick Bolasie reserving their best work for defence. They had plucked the lead from incessant City pressure, Joel Ward lofting the ball towards the penalty area for Joe Ledley to flick on and Scott Dann to volley at goal. Joe Hart kept that shot out but Murray tapped in, the visitors’ vociferous complaints thereafter centring on whether Dann had been offside.\n\nTouré’s dopy reaction at a defensive wall early in the second half arguably helped Puncheon curl in a glorious second. “That was about resilience and good organisation,” added Pardew, “with great character in the team. We got a bit of luck and there were some scary moments … about 23 of them, I counted. But we managed to see it through.

Kane’s breakthrough year is ever less likely to culminate in qualification for the Champions League and a sterile stalemate suggested a Spurs team playing their 50th game of the season are running out of steam.\n\nWhile Sean Dyche, the Burnley manager, was typically upbeat, he should also deem it a missed opportunity. His side clambered back above QPR in the table but remain below the dotted line and are running out of chances to extricate themselves from the relegation zone. Like Tottenham they rely on incessant running and did not display the sharpness required to be incisive. What qualified as a heatwave by Burnley’s standards contributed to a lacklustre game. They were sunbathing in the executive boxes, whereas bad weather normally makes Turf Moor an inhospitable place to visit.\n\nTottenham’s Pochettino: Champions League qualification now difficult task Read more\n\nIt amounted to the sort of match that may be remembered more for the teamsheet than anything that actually happened on the pitch. The circled “C” next to Kane’s name showed he joined an illustrious line of Spurs captains, even if he owed his elevation from the ranks to the misfortune of others.\n\nYounès Kaboul, the designated club captain, lost his place months ago. The injured Hugo Lloris, who normally wears the armband, and his ill deputy Jan Vertonghen were both sidelined. An inexperienced team contained few obvious candidates for the captaincy. Kane filled in as the leader but no one took on his usual mantle as the goal-getter.\n\nNot since Lineker has anyone mustered 30 in a season for Spurs; Kane will surely join an exclusive club but remains rooted on 29 for now. This was that rarity, a match when even the usually ubiquitous Kane was anonymous. He dragged one shot wide but Burnley’s 37-year-old centre-back Michael Duff policed the Premier League’s joint-top scorer rather better than many a more trumpeted talent.\n\nKane’s England Under-21 team-mate Danny Ings was more prominent but, while his efforts bookended the first half, the Tottenham target’s goal drought has now extended to six games. His first opportunity represented his best. Burnley tend to be swift starters and Spurs were caught out by the speed of their pressing. England’s newest debutant Ryan Mason was robbed by George Boyd, who released Ings, only for Burnley’s top scorer to direct his shot straight at Michel Vorm. Some 40 minutes later, the Dutchman flung himself to his left to tip Ings’ dipping effort over the bar.\n\nVorm also averted embarrassment when Ings’ up-and-under threatened to provide a goal from the corner flag, diverting it away. The signing from Swansea, who was beaten three times as a replacement after Lloris was carried off against Leicester, marked a belated first league start for Tottenham with a clean sheet.\n\nAs a previously porous side were without their first-choice goalkeeper and centre-back, in Vertonghen, and were forced into a defensive reshuffle when Kyle Walker sprained his ankle, that may represent progress. Vlad Chiriches, who flourished in two positions, was a stand-in who stood up to the challenge. Yet Spurs’ shut-out could say more about Burnley, who have struck only once in five games. Boyd’s winner against Manchester City was wonderful but they are failing to score the scrappier goals teams in their predicament tend to require and Boyd headed narrowly wide in stoppage time when Spurs were unsettled by a long throw.\n\nSpurs were largely limited to long-range shots as Burnley defended the penalty box doggedly. Their goalkeeper Tom Heaton was only called into action twice, holding 20-yard efforts from Nacer Chadli and Christian Eriksen, both at the second attempt.\n\nTactical indecision results in deadlock between Burnley and Spurs Read more\n\nWhile Tottenham possessed neither invention nor incision, Andros Townsend, England’s catalytic substitute in Turin, surfaced only for a seven-minute cameo. He was overlooked first when Paulinho started and then when the ineffectual Erik Lamela was introduced. The Brazilian was granted just his second league start of the season, but spurned the chance to prove Mauricio Pochettino wrong for marginalising him. His afternoon was notable for a shot that skewed off the wrong side of his foot in a manner that scarcely suggested he had played in a World Cup semi-final.\n\nIf the failings of expensive imports have been camouflaged by the homegrown favourite, this may have illustrated the extent to which Kane has carried Tottenham this season.

A truly terrible game hit almost ridiculous lows before being rescued by Jermain Defoe’s sublimely brilliant volleyed winner. Thanks to a single swipe of the former England striker’s left boot, Dick Advocaat’s hopes of saving Sunderland from relegation increased appreciably as John Carver’s already slender chances of staying in charge of Newcastle United next season receded a little further in the rear view mirror.\n\nAlong the way Sunderland, somewhat extraordinarily in the context of their recent struggles, recorded a fifth straight north-east derby victory against the Tynesiders. Carver’s injury and suspension affected side were in such disarray that they did not test Costel Pantilimon until the 78th minute.\n\nWhen Mike Williamson is a team’s sole fit senior centre-half that side has problems. This was the predicament Carver found himself in on Wearside but it had threatened to become appreciably worse when Daryl Janmaat began limping in the warm-up. Really a right-back, Janmaat is currently serving as Williamson’s partner in the centre and his loss would have been little short of catastrophic.\n\nAs it turned out things were bad enough for the visitors but at least Janmaat appeared for the first half, albeit moving a little tentatively as Sunderland began as they would continue for the next 75 minutes – firmly on the front foot. Yet despite the presence of three forwards – Defoe, Steven Fletcher and Connor Wickham – in Advocaat’s starting XI, their final ball proved consistently wanting, dictating that Tim Krul was not exerted unduly. Such attacking bluntness has been a recurring theme this season and an immensely disappointing Newcastle certainly had reason to be grateful for it as they struggled to impose themselves on the game.\n\nSignificantly Moussa Sissoko, Carver’s key midfielder, failed to make much of an impact throughout, leaving Sunderland’s Lee Cattermole free to dominate central midfield. The importance of the duel between that pair was highlighted when, for once, Sissoko won a challenge against his nemesis. Immediately Newcastle counter-attacked, briefly morphing into a very different, suddenly cohesive, side. Even so, any scouts from Arsenal, Paris Saint-Germain or elsewhere will have noted that such positive cameos were few and far between on Sissoko’s part. Cattermole is very good, but the Frenchman should have done much better against him.\n\nIt hardly helped Carver’s cause that the Tyneside injury crisis had forced him to relocate Jack Colback from his customary midfield to left-back. Once of Sunderland, Colback’s every touch was jeered to the echo but along with Janmaat, Ryan Taylor, Krul and Jonás Gutiérrez, he was one of only a handful of Newcastle players exempt from criticism. Thanks goodness a golf ball hurled at Colback by a Sunderland fan missed.\n\nJust in front of the visiting backline Gutiérrez, naturally a left-winger, fulfilled a quasi-sweeping role with considerable gusto. Considering that only a few short months ago he was undergoing chemotherapy for testicular cancer his proved a remarkable performance. If only Sissoko had exhibited merely half the Argentinian’s commitment.\n\nInstead Sunderland were allowed to showcase a general incompetence in front of goal, emphasised when Wickham accelerated down the right before shaping to cross towards the unmarked Defoe. In a moment somewhat emblematic of his season Wickham passed straight to Janmaat. Fortunately for Advocaat Defoe was about to remind everyone why the world’s best defenders once feared him so much. With a single, seamless, extension of his left boot the former Spurs striker not only raised the tone but gave Sunderland a half-time lead.\n\nIt began with an unpromising long ball punted forward for Fletcher to head up in the air, apparently destined for nowhere in particular. The good news for Advocaat was that the ball dropped on to Defoe’s out-stretched foot and, from well outside the area, he promptly executed a technically demanding volley, sending it arcing over Krul into the top corner. Carver must have felt a stake had been driven through his heart.\n\nAs the repercussions of a split second’s brilliance totally out of sync with almost everything that had gone before sunk in, Sunderland’s board presumably remembered why they had agreed to pay Defoe, who seemed close to tears, £70,000 a week.\n\nNewcastle’s manager responded by replacing Yoan Gouffran, abysmal in central midfield, with Emmanuel Rivière as he switched from 4-1-4-1 to 4-4-2. Rivière is still to score a Premier League goal and never looked like doing so here.\n\nDespite a hat-trick against Gibraltar for Scotland last week Fletcher, too, has endured a pretty woeful time in front of goal domestically. Sure enough he spurned the chance to double Sunderland’s lead by shooting wastefully over the bar from 18 yards.\n\nIt might have proved costly had Pantilimon not reacted smartly to repel Rémy Cabella’s shot. Twelve minutes of normal time remained and it was the first save Sunderland’s goalkeeper had made. Belatedly rallying, Carver’s side were to have one more chance. When Janmaat flicked on Taylor’s corner, the ball fell kindly for Ayoze Pérez but he could not quite cushion his volley and the ball squirmed over the bar.\n\nAll that remained was for Advocaat to greet the final whistle with arms folded, a slow, approving smile playing at the corners of his mouth.\n\nMan of the match Jermain Defoe (Sunderland)"}, {"date": "04/04/2015", "arena": "Emirates

wins, but even in his most optimistic moments he wouldn’t have dared to imagine the sudden blur of startling football that created a chasm between his team and Liverpool.\n\nHaving been on the receiving end last season at Anfield, when Arsenal were obliterated in an early kick-off by a burst of attacking football, the tables were turned at the Emirates. Three stunning strikes in eight first-half minutes crushed Liverpool, and demonstrated Arsenal at their best, full of self expression and the desire to play what Wenger describes as “the game we love”.\n\nThree excellent goals, from Héctor Bellerín, Mesut Özil and Alexis Sánchez, shredded Liverpool, who travelled south with a few headaches as far as their lineup was concerned, and went home with a nauseating migraine. Next season’s Champions League looks a faded dream now.\n\nPremier League: Arsenal v Liverpool – in pictures Read more\n\nThey looked flummoxed from the off, reorganised in a way that left them uncomfortable and exposed. Kolo Touré came into a back four that missed Martin Skrtel terribly. Jordan Henderson was shunted wide right. Raheem Sterling began up front, the centre of attention.\n\nAfter Arsenal forced the early issues, with Simon Mignolet picking up the pieces from a Santi Cazorla fizzer and an effort Aaron Ramsey should have scored from, Liverpool did threaten briefly.\n\nPhilippe Coutinho’s delicate pass to Lazar Markovic was perfect; Markovic’s layoff to the onrushing Sterling fractionally less so. The crowd held its breath in that millisecond as the goal gaped and the ball traversed towards the supposed man of the moment. Too strong. Sterling flashed a leg at the ball but it was gone.\n\nAnd soon, so were Liverpool. Brendan Rodgers described it as a “crazy period” from the perspective of his team’s defending. Arsenal seized the moment for an effervescent exhibition.\n\nA move of classic refinement gave them the lead. It started as Özil gathered the ball in the centre circle. He paused. Looked. Calculated. Then he lofted an arcing pass over to Aaron Ramsey on the right, who noticed Bellerín galloping upfield.\n\nThe young Spaniard, who has deputised at right-back with such aplomb this season, had the confidence to canter goalwards and plant the ball with his left foot into the far corner of the goal. “He is one of the surprises of the season,” enthused Wenger.\n\nThen came Özil takeover time. The German’s influence on big games is questioned by some, but he demonstrated the peak of his capabilities here. In a promising position he was clipped by Mamadou Sakho, and it was revealing in terms of his much analysed body language that he got up, no nonsense, and grabbed the ball with intent as if to make sure the free-kick was his and nobody else’s. His set-piece was struck beautifully, and sailed past Mignolet.\n\nMesut Özil scores Arsenal’s second goal against Liverpool in the Premier League match at the Emirates Stadium. Photograph: Julian Finney/Getty Images\n\nWenger said: “What he does is always classy, intelligent, and the timing of his passes is absolutely fantastic. He is agile, flexible and always available in between the lines. When you play with him in the team you would love to play with him. Sometimes he is criticised for his physical challenges but he is on the way and improving in that. He makes a big effort to work hard for the team.”\n\nArsenal’s third was all about Sánchez demonstrating that spark and high energy, full power game that drives him. His footwork at top speed was sensational, matched by the wellied thump he got on the ball for his 20th goal of the season. The Emirates Stadium is not known for erupting with the joyous noise that greeted that goal – it seemed to be a kind of confirmation of everything Wenger strives for.\n\nWith the game seemingly irretrievable, Rodgers sent on Daniel Sturridge at half-time. Liverpool competed more vigorously in a fairly open second half.\n\nThey did get one goal back via the penalty spot, when Bellerín tripped Sterling. Henderson stepped up and although David Ospina reached it, the ball made it over the line.\n\nCazorla came close to restoring a three-goal margin when he struck a post at the end of a sweeping move. That honour went to Giroud, who won the ball on the halfway line, sprinted onto a beautiful return pass from Cazorla, and swerved into space to fire home.\n\n“It was a very convincing win in a very important game,” concluded Wenger.\n\nArsenal are so enjoying their groove, while Liverpool’s season has been derailed in their big contests against Manchester United and Arsenal. All focus now switches to the FA Cup, where they are short of defensive resources with Emre Can joining Skrtel in the suspensions column after a sending off for two bookable challenges.\n\nIt seems bizarre to say “if only” at the end of what was, in spells, the most dazzling and accomplished football Arsenal have played this season.\n\nBut playing with the power and panache to take Liverpool apart, it is reasonable for Wenger to wonder what might have been if only Arsenal had started this irrepressible run of form earlier."}, {"date": "04/04/2015", "arena": "Goodison Park", "attendance":

Everton’s hard-fought, slender victory – their first over a top-eight team this season – prompted the latest lament from Ronald Koeman over the lack of cutting edge and creativity within his ranks. His sights have lowered as a consequence.\n\n“You never know, everyone has difficult games to play, but it is not realistic at this moment to think about the top-four positions,” the Southampton manager said. “It is more realistic to think about the Europa League, although the Europa League for us is like the Champions League to Arsenal and Manchester United. That is the difference.”\n\nThe difference here was a finishing touch. Phil Jagielka had one, indeed the England international’s performance had everything that Roberto Martínez’s team required from a captain, and Southampton did not. They took the game to Everton throughout and Tim Howard had to be in fine form to nullify a threat that evaporated after half-time, although the home side’s work-rate, tenacity and defensive organisation impressed.\n\nAaron Lennon, Ross Barkley and, particularly, Jagielka, pitted against Italy international Graziano Pellè for the second time in five days, typified a committed display that gave Everton a third consecutive Premier League win for the first time this season. This was a most un-Martínez-like win from Everton, who resembled the away team at times with their willingness to sit back, absorb pressure and hit Southampton on the counter-attack. Not that Goodison had many complaints with Romelu Lukaku sidelined by a hamstring injury, Darron Gibson facing a spell on the sidelines with a broken metatarsal and safety now beckoning.\n\nKoeman said: “I am disappointed with the final result but not with the performance. We had some good chances in the first half but it was more difficult in the second. Everton dropped back more, they were very strong defensively, and it was difficult to create chances in the second half. Everton were at home but were defending the result. That was out of respect for us and it made it difficult.”\n\nSouthampton made a determined start in their attempt to leapfrog Liverpool into fifth and it required a superb save from Howard to deny Pellè from their first meaningful attack. Shane Long left Leighton Baines trailing as he sprinted down the right and crossed to the near post where the striker steered the ball over the back-peddling Everton keeper. The US international readjusted his footing just in time to claw away Pellè’s effort on the line.\n\nHoward made another fine reaction save when James Ward-Prowse’s long-range drive appeared late through a crowded penalty area. The Southampton midfielder did leave the keeper rooted to the spot with a free-kick from 25 yards but, fortunately for Everton, his shot sailed inches wide.\n\nWhile the visitors’ attacking prowess kept Everton occupied, their defence offered them encouragement – especially from set-pieces or when Arouna Koné managed to bring Barkley, Leon Osman and Lennon into play. Koné, leading the line in the absence of Lukaku, drove the home crowd to distraction with his poor distribution but his industry could not be faulted.\n\nManchester United 3-1 Aston Villa | Premier League match report Read more\n\nRyan Bertrand produced a perfectly timed challenge to prevent James McCarthy opening the scoring from the Ivory Coast forward’s neat pass into the penalty area. That interception instigated a series of corners and, from the third, Jagielka delivered the all-important breakthrough.\n\nSouthampton’s defence failed to deal with Baines’s in-swinging delivery, Gareth Barry reacted quickest to the ensuing scramble to cut the ball back from the by-line and the defender steered his shot beyond the stand-in keeper Kelvin Davis from close range. “The ball went in off my shin pad but who cares,” he said.\n\nMartinez added: “We showed a lot of fight and character. We managed the game really well and showed we have learned our lessons from what has been a difficult season at times.”"}, {"date": "04/04/2015", "arena": "The King Power Stadium", "attendance":

the Foxes’ fading hopes of avoiding relegation.\n\nBarely five minutes remained of a flawed but frantically entertaining encounter when the substitute Andy King, a City stalwart if ever there was one, was in the right place at the right time to poke Jamie Vardy’s scuffed shot past the West Ham goalkeeper Adrián from inside the six yard box.\n\nIt was the latest in a remarkable series of chances created by both sides in the final quarter. Only a few minutes earlier the Hammers midfielder Cheikhou Kouyaté had rolled a shot against the inside of the City goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel’s right-hand post when it looked easier to score.\n\nOn such fine margins do seasons, and indeed careers, rest, and though City are still bottom, with eight games remaining they are, for the time being at least, only four points off safety.\n\nTheir manager Nigel Pearson, whose side had taken an early lead through Esteban Cambiasso – the first time they had scored in the opening 15 minutes at home this season – and then seen Adrián save David Nugent’s penalty soon afterwards, was an understandably relieved man.\n\n“I’m pleased for the players, they’ve deserved better results than we’ve had of late. Before today we were looking at a season of nine games, with six at home, and we knew we had to get a result.\n\n“One or two moments didn’t go their way, and those are the fine lines I’ve been talking about this season. Missing the penalty, which came from an exceptional move, possibly affected our belief and confidence for 20 minutes, but the whole of the second half we were in the ascendancy. They had their moments but we really tried to force the game, and all three substitutes had a positive impact.”\n\nHis side bristled with positivity from the start, and they deserved to take the lead given them in the 12th minute by Cambiasso. The deflection off James Collins that lead to the ball sitting up nicely for the veteran midfielder may have been fortunate, but the volley steered past Adrián from around 20 yards oozed class.\n\nIt should have been two three minutes later, when Carl Jenkinson brought down Leo Ulloa with a crudely mistimed tackle inside the Hammers penalty area. Nugent stepped up but Adrián dived to his left to push the spot-kick away.\n\nGradually West Ham began to assert themselves and slightly after the half hour deservedly equalised. Jeff Schlupp, criminally, allowed Alex Song’s pass to drop over his head on the right of the City penalty area, and Kouyaté, coming in behind him, controlled and shot low and firmly beyond Schmeichel.\n\nManchester United 3-1 Aston Villa | Premier League match report Read more\n\nPearson replaced the ineffectual Riyad Mahrez with Marc Albrighton at the break and once again City took the early initiative. Vardy flashed a header just the wrong side of the post and then, freed by Nugent in the West Ham penalty area, saw his technique let him down as he attempted to direct his shot inside Adrián’s right-hand post.\n\nWest Ham should have taken the lead when, with 20 minutes remaining, Song and Kouyaté combined for Kouyaté to roll a close-range shot against Schmeichel’s right-hand post. Instead it was Leicester who won the game, though not before Winston Reid and Aaron Cresswell had combined to clear Andrej Kramaric’s shot off the line. When King popped up, however, the Hammers defence was finally beaten.\n\n“It was a really open game, and from a neutral point of view it must have been fantastic entertainment, but while it’s great to play open, attractive football, but we’re professionals and the bottom line is we didn’t get anything out of the game,” said the Hammers manager Sam Allardyce."}, {"date": "04/04/2015", "arena": "Old

in March that removed the doubts about their ability to rejoin the Champions League elite.\n\nThis fifth league win in a row took them above Manchester City in the table for the first time this season, and with Arsenal moving up to second it is Manuel Pellegrini and his players who are under pressure to finish the campaign on a high. City have that tricky away fixture against Crystal Palace on Monday evening, and next weekend visit Old Trafford. They are unlikely to drop out of the top four altogether now that Liverpool’s recovery appears to have stalled but, if United and Arsenal keep up their present form, City could suddenly be looking at finishing third or fourth in what for months seemed a two-horse race.\n\n“Next week we will be playing for a place higher in the table,” Louis van Gaal said. “It will be a different type of game, because I don’t think City will set out as defensively as Aston Villa, but the most important thing is to win. We played well to win against Tottenham and Liverpool, but against City I don’t mind if we play ugly.”\n\nIn front of what commentators used to call a shirt-sleeved crowd, United greeted the warm spring sunshine with something of their old brio.\n\nThere was no hesitant sideways passing, no need for spectators to exhort Van Gaal’s players to attack. With a settled, successful side at last – Chris Smalling was the only absentee from the last starting line-up as he has a virus – the home side tore into their opponents as of old. Wayne Rooney could have had a penalty as early as the fourth minute when Ciaran Clark was lucky to get away with pulling him down by the shirt collar, then Juan Mata saw a shot blocked after a delightful run and cross from the left by Ashley Young. Marcos Rojo brought a fingertip save from Brad Guzan with a 25-yard screamer, before Rooney tried an ambitious overhead volley from Antonio Valencia’s right-wing cross and narrowly failed to connect.\n\nWith the crowd murmuring appreciation for neat work in defence from the likes of Valencia or Michael Carrick, and breaking into enthusiastic applause when Young then Daley Blind broke forward to test Guzan, all that was missing was a goal. United might have felt a little sheepish at turning round level, such had been their first-half dominance, but just when Aston Villa were beginning to feel they might reach the interval without damage the deadlock was broken.\n\nMarouane Fellaini and Young started the move on the left, the latter making smart use of Blind’s overlapping run, and when the full-back produced a pull-back rather than a cross Ander Herrera controlled the ball neatly with his right foot before finding Guzan’s bottom corner with his left.\n\nVilla needed to find a way of answering back in the second half, if only to show something has changed under Tim Sherwood and that meekly accepting their fate is now a thing of the past. All they had managed in the first 45 minutes was a commendable defensive effort and a couple of isolated charges forward by Christian Benteke and Gabriel Agbonlahor. They improved on that within minutes of the restart, with Benteke running at the United defence and finding Andreas Weimann in support at his shoulder, but the Belgian was perhaps not expecting a return pass and when it came he could only stab over the bar.\n\nYoung immediately showed more threat at the other end, cutting in from the left and sending a curling shot just the wrong side of Guzan’s upright. It seemed only a matter of time before United increased their lead, and but for Guzan clawing away a close range header from Fellaini they would have done so after an hour. United were working hard to keep Villa pressed back, the visitors were finding it difficult to break out of their own half, and with 20 minutes remaining Van Gaal sent on Ángel Di María. Then Radamel Falcao. Sherwood was not about to take that lying down so he sent on Joe Cole.\n\nEverton 1-0 Southampton | Premier League match report Read more\n\nDi María provided the necessary inspiration, beating Jores Okore to cross from the left for Rooney to put United two up with a splendid piece of control and improvisation – though Cole made a difference too. Even though his corner kick 10 minutes from time was woeful, barely deserving to beat the first defender, it nevertheless eluded every United shirt and allowed Benteke to sweep the ball past a startled David de Gea. Startled because up to that point Villa had not registered a single shot on target, nor had the goalkeeper been required to make a save. United held on without too much difficulty, especially after Rooney and Mata helped Herrera add a stylish third goal in stoppage time, though Villa gave them more to worry about in the last 10 minutes than the previous 80.\n\nIt was too little too late, and Villa need to make sure that does not become the story of their season. QPR’s win against West Brom reduces Sherwood’s margin for error, though the Villa manager remains bullish for the visit of the London club in midweek. “Our injury list is horrendous,” Sherwood said. “But we showed spirit to compete today and we will be looking to be six points clear of QPR again by Tuesday night.”"}, {"date": "04/04/2015", "arena": "The Liberty Stadium", "attendance": 20333,

The Frenchman was offside when Naughton headed the ball into the area, but Alex Bruce and Robbie Brady’s bungled defensive clearance brought him back into play to fire a stunning aerial volley high into the net.\n\nBruce sent his side out early for the second half with a flea in their collective ears and he got a response when McShane prodded home Alex Bruce’s flick-on from a Brady free-kick. But no sooner had Hull hopes risen than they were dented by Meyler. The midfielder made contact with the ball first but his studs first tackle into Naughton’s shin left referee Andre Marriner in little option but to show him a red card.\n\nAbel Hernández could still have salvaged a point for the away team, but failed to connect with McShane’s cross, and Gomis showed him how it should be done as he finished a stoppage time break out by delicately lofting over McGregor.

Relegation favourites at the start of the day, QPR finished it only one point from safety and wishing that they could play West Bromwich Albion every week. This was about as good as it gets for QPR as everything clicked into place on an afternoon when Bobby Zamora filed a contender for goal of the season and Joey Barton twisted the knife with a late fourth.\n\nIt was a scoreline that nobody could have predicted beforehand and, as Barton celebrated in front of the travelling supporters at the final whistle, it felt like a trick of the mind that QPR had come into this game on the back of five straight defeats and with only one away win to their name all season.\n\nForget those statistics. It is all about the here and now and this was a result to send confidence coursing through Chris Ramsey’s players ahead of Tuesday’s crucial game at Aston Villa. The margin of victory flattered QPR a little and who knows how Ramsey’s side would have reacted if Albion had taken one of several chances to get back to 3-2, but the visitors weathered that storm and ran out comfortable winners when Barton drilled home in injury time.\n\nBy that stage Albion were playing with 10 men after Youssouf Mulumbu was sent off for elbowing Barton 11 minutes after coming off the bench. Tony Pulis claimed that Mulumbu “led with his hand up” rather than his elbow but the fact that the Albion head coach has no intention of appealing against the decision tells its own story.\n\nPulis was more upset with how his team performed during a first half when QPR scored three times – “we powder-puffed our way through 45 minutes of Premier League football” – implying that complacency had set in. “Getting to 33 points, people listen to social media and the press,” he said. “We haven’t got over the line by a mile yet. I said to them afterwards: ‘If you’re not on it 100% in this league, you’ll get a rude awakening.’’”\n\nAlbion must be sick of the sight of QPR and Charlie Austin in particular. The striker scored a hat-trick in a 3-2 win at Loftus Road in December and he took his tally for the season to 16 with a far-post header here. To put it another way, a quarter of Austin’s Premier League goals have come against Albion.\n\nEduardo Vargas, with a superb dipping shot from 25 yards, had already put QPR in front by the time Austin nodded in Niko Kranjcar’s flick on. It was Zamora’s goal, though, that took the breath away. Running onto Matt Phillips’ pass, Zamora outpaced Joleon Lescott in the inside right channel and, without breaking stride, exquisitely flicked the ball with the outside of his left boot over the head of Boaz Myhill and into the net via the underside of the crossbar.\n\nNot bad for a player that is unable to train or complete 90 minutes because of his creaking body. “He’ll go into some sort of programme over the weekend to try and get him ready for Tuesday,” Ramsey said. “We have to take him off after a certain time because we need him for the rest of the season.”\n\nDesperate to inject fresh life into his team, Pulis brought on Victor Anichebe at half-time and was rewarded with a goal 13 minutes later when the substitute headed in Saido Berahino’s centre. The Albion comeback never materialised, however, and it was left to Barton, not for the first time in his life, to have the final word."}, {"date": "04/04/2015", "arena": "Stamford Bridge", "attendance": 41098, "home_team": {"name": "Chelsea", "lineup": [{"name": "Thibaut Courtois", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Branislav Ivanovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gary Cahill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Terry", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "César Azpilicueta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cesc Fàbregas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nemanja Matic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willian", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Oscar", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Eden Hazard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [39], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Loïc Remy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [62], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [63]}], "subs": [{"name": "Petr Cech", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Filipe Luis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kurt Zouma", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ramires", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Didier Drogba", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [57], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Diego Costa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": [57]}, {"name": "Juan Cuadrado", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [63], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Stoke City", "lineup": [{"name": "Asmir Begovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Geoff Cameron", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Shawcross", "yellows": [31], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Philipp Wollscheid", "yellows": [69], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marc Wilson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stephen Ireland", "yellows": [45], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [78]}, {"name": "Steven N'Zonzi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Glenn Whelan", "yellows": [26], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charlie Adam", "yellows": [66], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [44], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [79]}, {"name": "Mame Biram Diouf", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [62]}, {"name": "Jon Walters", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Phil Bardsley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Erik Pieters", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [79], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marc Muniesa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marko Arnautovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [62], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steve Sidwell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Butland", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Peter Crouch", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [78], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "If Chelsea’s pursuit of a first Premier League title in five years had already sported an air of inevitability, then this latest success has merely served to reinforce that sense. Even the ping of their top scorer’s hamstring or an equaliser conceded from well inside their opponents’ half cannot stop José Mourinho’s side for long these days, Charlie Adam’s jaw-dropping goal from around 65 yards rendered a mere footnote when it deserved to be a headline.\n\nThe leaders boast a seven-point advantage at the top and, even if that gap is trimmed to six by Manchester City on Monday night, they will still benefit from a game in hand on the trio of clubs closest to them in a distant chasing pack. Chelsea are ticking off the games, grinding out wins despite key players starting to wilt at the workload they have taken on this term. Five more victories and a draw will see them home even if medical checks over the week ahead will determine how much of a part Diego Costa plays in those fixtures.\n\nChelsea lose Diego Costa for key games with hamstring trouble Read more\n\nA player initially rested here ended up lasting only 12 minutes having been introduced at the break with this arena still digesting Adam’s ridiculous equaliser. Mourinho confirmed the forward faces at least two weeks on the sidelines though, in reality, that initial diagnosis may prove optimistic. His absence will be felt, particularly given there are collisions with Manchester United and Arsenal to come after next Sunday’s west London derby at Loftus Road, even if his stand-in, Loïc Rémy, has now scored the winner in successive games.\n\nThe Frenchman’s decisive goal here was a gift from the otherwise excellent Asmir Begovic, the goalkeeper rolling the ball towards Steven Nzonzi only for Willian to intercept. Eden Hazard, at his inspirational best throughout, dribbled into the area and squared for the striker to score into an empty net, with the relief around this arena palpable. Forget mind-boggling attempts from distance: this team will be more than happy to stroll over the finish line with a series of opposition aberrations and tap-ins.\n\nStoke’s own reward here had been spectacular, a goal to eclipse that of David Beckham in 1996 in terms of its audacious quality even if it lacked the player’s superstar-in-the-making looks. The visitors had been defending just before the interval when Stephen Ireland intercepted and fed Adam, the Scot meandering to the edge of the centre-circle inside his own half before pummelling a shot so optimistic it initially felt like a clearance into touch to grant his team-mates a breather. Yet the shot arced wickedly, a panicked Thibaut Courtois only able to paw at it with his left hand as he back-tracked and the ball veered into the net.\n\nMark Hughes described the midfielder’s 50th career goal as “outrageous”. Mourinho, while piqued by a foul on Hazard in the build-up, elaborated. “I didn’t enjoy it, but it was a goal every top player in the world would love to score,” he said. “From Diego Maradona to Lionel Messi, all these brilliant players … some of them did it, but not all of them. He can. It’s a fantastic goal, but we made a mistake. It’s a clear foul on Hazard, but we cannot stop waiting for the referee to give it. We have to react, press the ball, close the space. The goalkeeper also has to anticipate what can happen behind him, but it’s a goal for his history, probably the best goal for the season in the Premier League. It’s a pity it doesn’t give him any points.”\n\nBrendan Rodgers blasts Raheem Sterling’s agents after Arsenal defeat Read more\n\nIn the end the only real ramifications were felt by Costa, who had been flung on as a direct result and in pursuit of parity. Chelsea had laboured at times without him in that first period, Begovic denying them reward from an urgent opening and Stoke rugged and organised until self-destructing with half-time in sight. Hazard’s backheel and Willian’s slide-rule pass liberated Cesc Fàbregas, with Philipp Wollscheid sliding in as the Spaniard dragged the ball back with his instep. The penalty was not disputed and was dispatched with ease by Hazard.\n\nThe Belgian was inspirational, a constant menace demanding the ball and tearing at his markers. He should have supplied Juan Cuadrado with a third before the end only for the Colombian, offered a rare cameo, to strike Begovic with a point-blank shot and then with the rebound when it appeared easier to score. Mourinho had slumped across the advertising hoarding in frustration at those misses, his nerves frayed further when Nzonzi struck a post, though it mattered not.\n\n“A victory is a victory,” he added. “I sent [Aitor] Karanka an SMS yesterday after Middlesbrough won 1-0 and told him 1-0 in April is like 10-0 in November. Our countdown is only about us. At lunchtime, we needed six victories and one draw. At dinnertime, five victories and one draw.”"}, {"date": "22/03/2015", "arena": "Anfield", "attendance": 44405, "home_team": {"name": "Liverpool", "lineup": [{"name": "Simon Mignolet", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Emre Can", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Skrtel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mamadou Sakho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Raheem Sterling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordan Henderson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Allen", "yellows": [19], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alberto Moreno", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [66]}, {"name": "Adam Lallana", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Daniel Sturridge", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [69], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Philippe Coutinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Brad Jones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Glen Johnson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kolo Touré", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Gerrard", "yellows": [], "reds": [46], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rickie Lambert", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lucas Leiva", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mario Balotelli", "yellows": [67], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [66], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Manchester United", "lineup": [{"name": "David De Gea", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Antonio Valencia", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Smalling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Jones", "yellows": [56], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daley Blind", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Michael Carrick", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Juan Mata", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [14, 59], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ander Herrera", "yellows": [47], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [83]}, {"name": "Marouane Fellaini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Young", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [55]}, {"name": "Wayne Rooney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [90], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Rafael", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marcos Rojo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ángel di María", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [55], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Falcao", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [83], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adnan Januzaj", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Valdes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andreas Pereira", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "It was a performance from Manchester United that has been a long time in the making and for Steven Gerrard another personal ordeal in an expanding file. Not as harrowing, perhaps, as the one that means Anfield is now subjected to chants of “you nearly won the league” but still to be placed among the more incongruous moments of all those fine years in Liverpool’s colours. Gerrard badly let down his team-mates and for a player of his distinction that will be the hardest thing to take.\n\nPerhaps it was the taunting from the away end that got under his skin. Or more likely it was the knowledge that his team were being outplayed and this would be the last time he could influence one of these occasions. Gerrard had barely worked up a bead of sweat by the time he was on his way back down the tunnel. There wasn’t a scuff of dirt on his kit. But the occasion – his last Liverpool-United fixture, starting on the bench, with his team desperately needing him to sprinkle the game with some of his old magic – undoubtedly got to him.\n\nA half-time substitute, he had been on the pitch 38 seconds when Ander Herrera slid in and clipped his ankles. Gerrard dealt out his own retribution, bringing down his studs on Herrera’s shin while the Spaniard was on the ground. The referee, Martin Atkinson, sent the Liverpool captain off and Anfield blinked, rubbed its eyes and tried to take in a red card that, to put it into context, was crazier and more self-defeating than anything Mario Balotelli has done this season.\n\nBalotelli, another substitute, had to be restrained later by some quick-thinking supporters as he tussled with Chris Smalling by the touchline. The Italian had been booked within 90 seconds of coming on and those supporters probably spared their team from going down to nine men. We expect this kind of brainstorm from Balotelli. But Gerrard? He did at least apologise after the match but it was a gross dereliction of duty and that lack of control seemed contagious. Martin Skrtel could conceivably face retrospective action for the stamp on David de Gea that engulfed the match in more controversy at the end.\n\nA man down, Liverpool actually played with great togetherness in an attempt to pull off an improbable feat of escapology. Juan Mata’s brilliant second goal arrived just before the hour and at that stage Liverpool might have been excused for thinking the game had become an exercise in damage limitation. Instead they came back in a way that threatened to spike United’s most rounded performance of the season. Daniel Sturridge halved the lead after 69 minutes and United had to withstand some awkward moments before Simon Mignolet saved Wayne Rooney’s stoppage-time penalty and the chaotic, bad-tempered finish.\n\nThere is no doubt, however, that on the balance of play the better team won. Mata was superb, with Herrera not far behind, whereas Liverpool’s lack of discipline was accompanied by some of the flaws that undermined them earlier in the season. De Gea might be aggrieved about being beaten at his near post by Sturridge’s shot but it was a slick and controlled performance that leaves United firmly established in fourth position, only a point behind Arsenal and two short of Manchester City.\n\nIn the first half in particular, Louis Van Gaal’s team played in a way that has rarely been seen since he took the job. “We played Liverpool off the pitch,” was the Dutchman’s assessment and Brendan Rodgers did not argue. “He [Gerrard] was probably frustrated; we didn’t make a tackle.” In better times Gerrard would have found another way. There would have been a crunching tackle, a long-range shot or a driving run, something choreographed to bring the crowd to its feet and lift his team-mates. The difference is he would have relied on pure ability and competitive courage rather than resorting to studs on flesh.\n\nThere was no real mitigation. It was, however, easy to understand if Gerrard was burning with frustration. Just before the half-hour, one statistic flashed up that Mignolet had touched the ball more times (10) than Jordan Henderson (eight). Henderson was overwhelmed in a way that, ironically, must have made the home crowd crave Gerrard’s presence.\n\nRaheem Sterling was out of position and out of sorts. Joe Allen was another who let the game pass him by and defensively there were some startling moments of carelessness, all the way until Emre Can brought down Daley Blind for United’s late penalty. Marouane Fellaini’s opponents found him a difficult man to tangle with. Blind and Antonio Valencia pushed up from the full-back positions. Herrera played in a way that made it seem absurd he has found it so difficult to get a place in the team and Mata looked absolutely determined to shape the match from his new position, in Van Gaal’s words, as a “false right-winger”.\n\nHis first goal was clinical in its execution and classy in its creation but the second was a thing of beauty, a scything volley after he exchanged passes with the substitute Ángel Di María, launching himself into the air and making the perfect connection to volley the ball into the far corner. It was a Mark Hughes-type special, albeit left-footed.\n\nLiverpool’s supporters were incensed shortly beforehand that Phil Jones was not sent off for a late challenge on Henderson but it was probably a shade between a yellow and a red – a shade of orange, perhaps – and the home side’s real problem stemmed from not passing the ball well enough or defending with cohesion.\n\nAlberto Moreno’s positioning for Mata’s first goal was a case in point. Skrtel was not in line with the other centre-backs and Herrera’s pass was beautifully weighted for Mata to finish with an equally precise shot in off the post. Liverpool, as Rodgers said, needed Gerrard. The old Gerrard, that is, not the one who lasted 38 seconds.\n\nMan of the match Juan Mata (Manchester United)"}, {"date": "22/03/2015", "arena": "KCOM Stadium", "attendance": 24598, "home_team":

in hand over their nearest challengers, the characteristics of their play at both ends of this victory bode well – two quality goals in the opening 10 minutes and a clinical purloining of the points with less than a quarter of an hour remaining – their subservience to a spirited Hull in between forgotten as they enter the international break.\n\nPegged back by a draw against Southampton seven days previously, recent history threatened to repeat itself before Rémy replaced Diego Costa a quarter of an hour from the end and scuffed in the winner off Allan McGregor’s boots a couple of minutes later to provide Chelsea with what Mourinho described as their most dominant position of the campaign.\n\n“The title race should be over. In normal conditions Chelsea should have eight to 10 points more than we have and it’s over. But the reality is we have a six points lead which is our best situation for the whole season because the maximum distance we had was eight with 20 matches to go,” said Mourinho, whose side also have a game in hand, against bottom club Leicester. “I am pretty confident. I believe in my players.”\n\nChelsea certainly started and finished like champions. Within 10 minutes they had made a mockery of Hull’s relatively sound defence – at kick-off no team outside the top six had conceded fewer than their 37 goals – with a couple of imperious finishes.\n\nThe first, dispatched from 20 yards by Eden Hazard’s left boot, owed to a combination of home hesitancy once Costa’s muscular lay-off cushioned the ball into the Belgian’s path. Allowed to proceed unopposed in a central position, Hazard gave McGregor no chance with a shot that arrowed inside the upright.\n\nThe second, emanating from Hull’s gifting of possession midway inside their own half, was equally clinical and nestled in a similar place in the net. Cesc Fàbregas threaded a pass into Costa’s stride and although the angle was difficult on the left side of the area, the use of Michael Dawson as a shield to unsight McGregor, and the accuracy of the curling effort combined for his 19th league goal of the season.\n\nIf the finish was typical Costa, so unfortunately were the second-half antics in which his elbow appeared to connect with Jake Livermore during a prolonged tussle between the pair at a corner. However, there were no gripes from the Hull camp post-match, with their manager Steve Bruce claiming not to have witnessed it.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Hull City manager Steve Bruce says his side is very disappointed after losing 3-2 to Chelsea\n\nHowever, a recurrence of Costa’s hamstring injury trouble may mean further reliance on Rémy. “When a guy with a lot of hamstring injuries says with 15 minutes to go it’s over for him, it’s over for him. He has this problem. He tried to play the Champions League final with Atlético and was injured again, and again, and again. He has this fragility so we know this hamstring is not a strong one,” said Mourinho, who dismissed any notion of surgery.\n\nLike Hazard, who made it three in three, Rémy has a good scoring record against Hull and it was therefore no surprise he popped up to steer in Willian’s low centre from the right a dozen minutes after Thibaut Courtois’ act of redemption –- a triple save foiling Ahmed Elmohamady, Livermore and Gastón Ramírez shots in the space of five seconds.\n\n“At half-time I told the players there was no point in analysing details and mistakes of the first half. The team felt deeply the 2-2 but the first minute of the second half they went back to quality football, to creation and I knew sooner or later the goal should arrive,” Mourinho said.\n\nHull’s comeback had been down to the tactical touchline scheming of Bruce and his recently-arrived assistant Mike Phelan midway through the first half. Having started with the 3-5-2 formation that had resulted in nine points being collected from their previous six matches, one of their central defenders was sacrificed, Dame N’Doye redeployed on the left flank and Ramírez wedged between a four-man midfield and his fellow Uruguayan, Abel Hernández, up front.\n\nIt worked a treat as a double strike – the fastest two goals by a side in the top flight this season – had the KC Stadium rocking. Scotland full-back Andrew Robertson was the creator of the first as his burst past Willian and through Branislav Ivanovic preceded a centre that Elmohamady converted from six yards. Then came Courtois’ blunder on the Humber. Ivanovic appeared to have tidied up another Hull attack with a back pass but Ramírez’s refusal to give up a lost cause induced panic and a heavy touch was pounced upon by Hernández.\n\nUltimately, their endeavour proved futile, although Bruce sought succour in the performance of his team, who sit three points above the drop zone but have a daunting conclusion to the season: they play five of the top seven.\n\n“That’s as good as we’ve played for a long, long time, against the best team in England. We are obviously disappointed in the manner we’ve lost but we’ve created umpteen opportunities, and … the big turning point was the three saves by Courtois in quick succession,” said Bruce."},

chance of wresting a trophy from a season of gloom but, as it turned out, they left Loftus Road having salvaged something even more valuable: their pride.\n\n“This was probably the most satisfying win since I arrived at Everton,” cooed Roberto Martínez, who lauded his players for showing solidity and quality so soon after the defensive disintegration against Dynamo Kyiv on Thursday, which had sabotaged their hopes of offsetting a rotten domestic season with progress in the Europa League.\n\n“After the emotions of Thursday, this was not a day for a technical performance. We had to show a strong will and strong care and the satisfaction is immense,” said Martínez, whose joy no doubt reflected the pressure amid growing fan disgruntlement with his management.\n\nChris Ramsey’s sentiments remained stranded at the other end of the spectrum. Rangers played with gusto and for a while looked the more likely winners but they wound up empty-handed. That is a familiar story for a team who have lost nine of their last 10 matches in the Premier League, including six of Ramsey’s seven matches in charge. They squat 19th in the table, four points below Sunderland in 17th, and need a radical reversal of fortune in their remaining eight matches if they are to survive.\n\nIt is hard to see what Ramsey can do to stimulate such a turnaround. He has been grappling for solutions ever since taking charge. For this match he tried another, making four changes to the side that flopped so meekly at Crystal Palace last week, omitting Darnell Furlong, dropping Adel Taarabt to the bench and sending Shaun Wright-Phillips back to cold storage. And Rangers began brightly, passing the ball with zip and pressing Everton with an intensity that prevented the visitors from finding fluency.\n\nRangers are not awash with creativity but Matt Phillips’ occasional dangerous crosses and Joey Barton’s long balls towards Bobby Zamora were causing the visitors’ discomfort. John Stones and Phil Jagielka generally stood tall, however, and Tim Howard did not have a difficult save in the first half – but the goalkeeper should have been beaten in the 32nd minute when Zamora for once eluded his markers to meet a cross from Charlie Austin, but fluffed a header from six yards out.\n\nEverton were already a goal up by then thanks to the best move of the match and a spectacular finish by Séamus Coleman. In the 18th minute Aaron Lennon pierced the home defence with the sort of incisive pass that Rangers seem incapable of producing. The winger then skittered forward to receive the ball back from Arouna Koné and fed Leon Osman, who slipped it into the path of Coleman, arriving at speed down the right. The Irishman took a touch before whacking the ball into the net off the post from a difficult angle, 18 yards out. “It was a striker’s finish,” said Martínez.\n\nOsman had gone close before that, flashing a shot over from seven yards after a corner. Still, Everton were not playing well enough to banish QPR’s hopes of coming back. They were in the lead at half-time but not in control.\n\nRangers might have scored within moments of the resumption. Junior Hoilett, who had barely featured in the first half, almost brought the home team level with a splendid curling shot over Howard, but was aghast to see it bounce off the crossbar.\n\nRangers kept the pressure on and the home side’s persistence was rewarded. As Everton tried in vain to clear the ball from their own box following a corner, it came to Eduardo Vargas, who rammed it into the net from close range. The Chilean had just been introduced as a substitute for Hoilett, and his first goal for his club since October stoked belief that Rangers could go on to win.\n\nBut Everton fought back in the 77th minute, when a swift move culminated with Coleman delivering a low cross from the right. Nedum Onuoha prevented Ross Barkley from reaching it but the ball broke to Lennon, who slotted it into the corner from seven yards. It was the loanee’s first goal for Everton, whose celebrations showed how precious it was. There was still time for Everton to celebrate a let-off too, as Taarabt fired against the crossbar moments after coming on as a late substitute.\n\n(Everton)"}, {"date": "21/03/2015", "arena": "Etihad Stadium", "attendance": 45018, "home_team": {"name": "Manchester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Joe Hart", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pablo Zabaleta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Vincent Kompany", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eliaquim Mangala", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gael Clichy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jesus Navas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fernando", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [40], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Frank Lampard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [65]}, {"name": "David Silva", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [77], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [81]}, {"name": "Wilfried Bony", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [27], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [78]}, {"name": "Sergio Agüero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Bacary Sagna", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Milner", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [81], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Edin Dzeko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [78], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willy Caballero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fernandinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martín Demichelis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stevan Jovetic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [65], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "West Bromwich Albion", "lineup": [{"name": "Boaz Myhill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Craig Dawson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gareth McAuley", "yellows": [], "reds": [2], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonas Olsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joleon Lescott", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stéphane Sessegnon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Darren Fletcher", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Craig Gardner", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Baird", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Morrison", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Saido Berahino", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [86]}], "subs": [{"name": "Andre Wisdom", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Anichebe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [86], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jason Davidson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sébastien Pocognoli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Youssouf Mulumbu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adil Nabi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Rose", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "The good news for Manchester City is that the gap at the top of the Premier League table has now been cut to three points, at least for a few hours.

There was a similar incident in the Wolves-Derby game on Friday and the player was not even booked,” Tony Pulis said. “But once he’s decided it was a goal-scoring opportunity I can’t believe he picked the wrong player. We all know it is a tough job but we can’t keep moaning about referees. The time has come to help them with a system of referrals.”\n\nSwarbrick admitted to his error after the match via Professional Game Match Officials Limited, which said in a statement: “The referee has confirmed the offence was caused by a different player, which should be addressed now as a case of mistaken identity. The referee has apologised for his error.”\n\nThat incident all but killed the contest even if it took City another 25 minutes to take the lead, with Frank Lampard shooting narrowly wide and David Silva bringing a flying save from Boaz Myhill while the game remained scoreless, but once they did the outcome was not in doubt.\n\nFittingly, it was Bony, who might have scored after a minute, who put the home side ahead with his first goal since his £25m transfer from Swansea. City moved the ball along the edge of the area searching for an opportunity until Fernando went for goal and saw his shot half blocked. The ball went forward rather than back, and though it reached Bony at an awkward height the striker stayed onside, brought it down well and finished from the six-yard line with his usual vigour.\n\nCity’s attempts on goal tally moved beyond 20 before half-time, with West Brom allowing Joe Hart a rest after his midweek heroics by failing to register a single effort, on target or otherwise. Not all of the home side’s attacks were incisive, it was more a case of shots from distance being blocked by a packed defence or saved by the goalkeeper, until the second goal arrived courtesy of a mix-up between Myhill and Jonas Olsson.\n\nWhen Eliaquim Mangala took out a defender to reach a Jesús Navas corner the goalkeeper appeared to have the loose ball covered, only for Olsson to scoop it out of his arms at the last moment to present Fernando with a chance he could hardly miss. It was the sort of defending to keep a coach awake at night and Pulis cut a disconsolate figure on the sideline in the minutes before the interval, frequently turning away or kicking the ground in frustration.\n\nMyhill helped keep the score respectable with two excellent saves from Silva and Sergio Agüero early in the second half, before Lampard set him an easier task with an underhit shot after Silva had picked up his run with a clever pass. By the time the hour came up City were finding ever more creative ways not to score.\n\nAgüero hit the post and Bony the bar on the same attack, before Navas crashed in a shot from a narrow angle to bring another fine save. That was something like City’s 36th attempt on goal, and the traffic was so one-way that when West Brom finally won a corner after 65 minutes their supporters leapt to their feet in ironic celebration. Had Saido Berahino pulled a goal back shortly afterwards, instead of heading against the bar from a corner, the home side might have been seriously embarrassed; instead the chance was missed and Stevan Jovetic came on to make the margin of victory more flattering with a shot from the edge of the area that Silva managed to help into the net."}, {"date": "21/03/2015", "arena": "Villa Park",

breathing space in their battle against relegation but familiar failings resurfaced on a chastening afternoon for the Aston Villa manager. Toothless up front, Villa were undone by a classic counterattack in the 87th minute when Bafétimbi Gomis, who had cut a frustrated figure for long periods, slid home Jefferson Montero’s inch-perfect cross.\n\nWith Villa chasing a fourth consecutive win in all competitions, Sherwood described the result as a reality check for those that viewed the 4-0 thumping of Sunderland as a leap towards survival. Villa remain three points clear of the relegation zone but face a daunting run of games, with three of their next four fixtures away, at Manchester United, Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester City. Their other match is a relegation scrap at home against Queens Park Rangers that looks absolutely crucial.\n\nOn this evidence nothing can be taken for granted. This felt like the Villa of old rather than the rejuvenated team that swept aside Sunderland at the Stadium of Light. Villa looked flat, especially in the first half, and although there was an improvement after the interval the home team never did enough as an attacking force to open Swansea up.\n\nGabriel Agbonlahor had a goalbound shot blocked by Neil Taylor and Scott Sinclair volleyed narrowly over moments after Swansea scored but Villa were huffing and puffing for the most part. At the other end, Gomis, who was making only his second appearance since fainting at Tottenham Hotspur, squandered three decent opportunities before finding his range, the Frenchman slotting the ball beyond Brad Guzan to leave Villa firmly in the mire.\n\n“We’re right in it,” Sherwood said. “Every point is vital and we need to pick up as many as we can to keep ourselves safe. We want to do it as quickly as we possibly can, but sometimes you get a kick in the … and that happened to us today. It’s a setback but we’ll pick ourselves up and be all right.”\n\nThe result felt more disappointing for Villa coming on the back of their emphatic victory at Sunderland. “You win 4-0 last week and everyone is jumping up and down, but we knew that there was still a lot of hard work to be done,” Sherwood said. “It’s a reality check – not for us, because we knew there was a lot of work to be done – but perhaps for people looking in from the outside.” Swansea have no such concerns. The Welsh club sit eighth, unable to get into Europe and under no threat of relegation, and yet there is no sense that they are coasting towards the end of the season and thinking about their summer holidays.\n\nFederico Fernández, back in the team after missing Monday’s defeat against Liverpool because of family reasons, was outstanding in central defence while Montero’s electric pace on the left, after Monk withdrew Gylfi Sigurdsson and changed to a 4-2-3-1 formation, caught the eye.\n\nIt is Gomis, though, who will have taken most satisfaction from the game, especially after what happened at White Hart Lane. “Of course it was a concern, but we understand Bafe’s situation and I think you’ve seen from his last two performances that there is no stopping him,” Monk said. “His commitment, his effort, his workrate was incredible. Yes, he would have been disappointed not to have taken a couple of the early chances but it typified the character of the team what he did in the second half. He persevered, kept pushing and he got his goal in the end. So all credit to him.”\n\nAll three of Gomis’s Premier League goals have come late and proved to be match winners. It was a lovely breakaway move that provided the defining moment in this slow burner of a game. Wayne Routledge fed Montero on the left and the Ecuador international delivered a splendid ball with the outside of the boot that implored the onrushing Gomis to score. Guzan had denied him twice in the first half and Ciaran Clark kept another effort out but this time the Swansea striker made no mistake. Routledge could, and should, have added a second in the dying seconds."}, {"date": "21/03/2015", "arena": "St James' Park, Newcastle", "attendance": 50544, "home_team": {"name": "Newcastle United", "lineup": [{"name": "Tim Krul", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Taylor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daryl Janmaat", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mike Williamson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Colback", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Vurnon Anita", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [72]}, {"name": "Moussa Sissoko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [48], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yoan Gouffran", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rémy Cabella", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sammy Ameobi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [89]}, {"name": "Ayoze Pérez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Jonás Gutiérrez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [72], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rob Elliot", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gabriel Obertan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Emmanuel Riviere", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Armstrong", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [89], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lubomir Satka", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Olivier Kemen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Arsenal", "lineup": [{"name": "David Ospina", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Calum Chambers", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gabriel Paulista", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Laurent Koscielny", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nacho Monreal", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Ramsey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Francis Coquelin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alexis Sánchez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [71]}, {"name": "Santi Cazorla", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [71]}, {"name": "Danny Welbeck", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [89]}, {"name": "Olivier Giroud", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [24, 28], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Wojciech Szczesny", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kieran Gibbs", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Per Mertesacker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tomas Rosicky", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [71], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Theo Walcott", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mathieu Flamini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [71], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Hector Bellerin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [89], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "So Arsenal continue to keep Manuel Pellegrini and perhaps even José Mourinho sweating while Newcastle United sleepwalk their way towards the end of a deeply unsatisfactory season? Well, not entirely; sometimes scorelines fail to tell quite the whole story.\n\nDespite a combination of injuries and suspensions to key personnel leaving John Carver’s side with a distinctly ersatz look, Newcastle were not quite so makeshift in practice. Indeed, Arsène Wenger was probably extremely relieved to escape with three points on a day when Olivier Giroud’s two first-half goals following set pieces kept Arsenal four points behind the leaders Chelsea and only one in arrears of second-placed Manchester City.\n\nTottenham Hotspur 4-3 Leicester City | Premier League match report Read more\n\n“The last 40 minutes were difficult,” acknowledged Wenger. “Newcastle played very well in the second half.” Tired after their midweek Champions League exertions against Monaco, his team faded as the day wore on but still did just enough to record a sixth straight Premier League victory and remind everyone they are not about to settle for staying third. “We are in the fight,” he said. “We want to do as well as we can.”\n\nWith Daryl Janmaat outstanding in an unfamiliar central defensive role, Newcastle succeeded in surprising some of their own supporters. “There wasn’t much in it until we conceded the first goal,” said Carver. “It’s always disappointing to lose to two set-piece goals but we showed we’re not on our holidays yet. And we also showed that, even when you’re down to the bare bones, if you prepare and set up properly you give yourselves a chance.”\n\nAll pace, possession and intelligent movement, Newcastle began deceptively brightly. Then Jack Colback, Carver’s left-back for the day, played it short to Vurnon Anita. The midfielder should have been able to move the ball forward but, seemingly unsure what to do, he unwisely passed back to Colback who was now under pressure from Giroud.\n\nColback was left with little option but to impede the Arsenal striker and concede a free-kick. Up stepped Santi Cazorla and in curved the set piece, allowing Danny Welbeck to flick on before Giroud directed the ball over the line with his left knee.\n\nIt was not long before Wenger’s French centre-forward scored again. This time Cazorla whipped in a corner and Giroud got across his marker before squeezing a header into the far bottom corner. It was his 17th goal in 26 appearances this season and eighth in six games against Newcastle.\n\nConsidering Carver’s back four comprised a midfielder who has spent much of the past few years battling serious injury (Ryan Taylor) at right-back, a right-back (Janmaat) at centre-half and a midfielder (Colback) at left-back, Newcastle were probably doing as well as could be expected in the circumstances. Much more acclaimed positional specialists have struggled similarly in the face of Cazorla, Alexis Sánchez, Giroud and friends. Not that this reality prevented an initially buoyant 50,000-plus crowd from booing the home team off at the interval. The Gallowgate End wanted to see David Ospina’s goal put under much more pressure.\n\nHappily for Carver, Moussa Sissoko changed the narrative right at the start of the second half. Cued up by a wonderful one-two involving Ayoze Pérez and Rémy Cabella, the midfielder’s low, first-time, right-foot shot whizzed past Ospina as Arsenal suddenly found themselves firmly on the back foot.\n\nStoke City 1-2 Crystal Palace | Premier League match report Read more\n\nWenger’s players looked winded in the face of Sissoko’s all-round dynamism and Newcastle’s collective powers of counterattacking acceleration. They might have conceded an equaliser but Pérez dispatched a curling 25-yard shot fractionally wide and then the same striker miscued an inviting shooting chance.\n\nNo matter: the momentum was with those wearing black and white and the choruses of Blaydon Races echoing around the ground confirmed the mood had transformed almost beyond recognition.\n\nWith Jonás Gutiérrez offering the Tynesiders further impetus after replacing Anita and Janmaat’s classy ease in possession frequently discomforting a thwarted Arsenal attack, a home equaliser would have been thoroughly deserved.\n\nInstead Carver and company were left all out of luck as Wenger kept on confounding those doubters who, until very recently, claimed he had overstayed his welcome in north London.

Davis has waited 14 months since his last Southampton appearance, but called upon as an early replacement for the injured Fraser Forster – who will now almost certainly be forced to withdraw from Roy Hodgson’s England squad – the 38-year-old made a contribution that could yet prove significant to the outcome of his side’s season.\n\nForster was carried off with his left knee in a splint after slipping awkwardly making a routine, 10th-minute clearance under pressure from Sam Vokes. The keeper has been outstanding this season and his departure was clearly a setback for a Southampton side anxious to register only their second win in six games and revive their fading hopes of forcing their way into the top four.\n\nDavis, though, proved a more than capable replacement, apparently unaffected by his lack of match action and producing a number of fine saves – full-length stops from Vokes and Danny Ings were particularly eye-catching – to deflate Burnley and lay the foundation for a victory secured through Shane Long’s first-half effort and Jason Shackell’s unfortunate 58th-minute own-goal.\n\nWhile Sean Dyche, the Burnley manager, was convinced his side should have had a first-half penalty, Southampton ended the game comfortably in control.\n\nAnything less than victory would have been an enormous blow to Ronald Koeman’s side. Instead, they will look forward to their remaining games with renewed confidence, with Davis expected to play a prominent role after the manager confirmed the news on Forster was not good. “He’s in hospital,” said Koeman. “It’s not looking positive for his knee. The doctor wasn’t positive. I don’t think he’ll be available for England.”\n\nThe win moved Koeman’s side to within three points of Manchester United, who lie fourth before their meeting with Liverpool. Koeman has maintained his belief that his side can sustain their challenge for a place in next season’s Champions League, setting his side the target of five wins in their final nine fixtures before this game.\n\nLast Sunday’s draw at Chelsea suggested the manager’s confidence had transmitted itself to his players and this was by no means a straightforward win against a side given fresh hope of avoiding relegation by their impressive victory over Manchester City seven days previously.\n\nHad Dyche’s side managed to find a way past Davis when they enjoyed a period of first-half control, the visitors may have been able to add to those unexpected three points . As it was, they offered enough signs to suggest they will enjoy more productive days between now and the end of the campaign.\n\nBoth managers were in agreement about Davis’s contribution. “Kelvin was fantastic,” said Koeman. “It was a long time ago that he last played, so that’s difficult. But he’s experienced, he’s not nervous to come in and that’s important for the defenders.”\n\nDyche, though, believed his side were guilty of failing to make more of their chances and expressed his frustration at the referee Roger East’s decision not to award a penalty when José Fonte appeared to trip George Boyd. “It was very surprising we didn’t get a penalty and that was the third in a couple of weeks,” added Dyche. “I tell my players not to simulate but maybe I’ll have to change– I must be the greenest manager in the world looking at that. But we had three key chances and didn’t take them. I was disappointed in the finishing.”\n\nThe visitors found themselves behind in the 37th minute. Dyche’s side had only themselves to blame for failing to clear a weak header from Sadio Mané, but they were entitled to feel hard done to when Nathaniel Clyne’s shot found its way to Long via a defender’s boot and a Graziano Pellè miskick. Long took full advantage, finishing from close range.\n\nEfforts from Steve Davis and Long early in the second half suggested the home side were anxious to avoid a repeat of the nervy first period and they established a comfort zone when Ryan Bertrand’s drilled cross was diverted past Tom Heaton off Shackell’s knee."}, {"date": "21/03/2015", "arena": "Bet365 Stadium", "attendance": 27532,

in their 2-1 loss to Crystal Palace.\n\nAfter Mame Biram Diouf’s close-range finish had put the Potters a goal up early on in the Premier League contest at the Britannia Stadium, they suffered what Hughes deemed the first injustice when Palace equalised in the 41st minute.\n\nThe referee Andre Marriner adjudged Asmir Begovic to have fouled Yannick Bolasie, who was chasing a long ball forward, as the pair collided in the box, and awarded a spot-kick which Glenn Murray firmly despatched. The official also booked Begovic, but Hughes felt it was Bolasie who had been guilty of an infringement.\n\nThe Stoke manager said: “My take on it at the time was that is was just a long ball knocked forward, and maybe we hadn’t dealt with it as well as we’d like to. But then you see the replay and you understand why, because I thought the lad Bolasie has got his foot up high, and that is what has taken Asmir’s eye and why he has missed the ball.\n\n“The referee deems it a penalty, but in my view it was a free-kick the other way for dangerous play. That was the key moment and those are the big decisions you want referees to get [right]. Andre Marriner missed a lot of things today I felt.”\n\nHughes was also aggrieved about an incident midway through the second period – by which point Stoke were trailing to Wilfried Zaha’s goal in first-half stoppage-time – when a Diouf shot in the area struck the arms of Palace defender Joel Ward, with play being allowed to continue.\n\nHughes said: “It was clear – arguably it was the best save of the match! [Palace goalkeeper Julián] Speroni has done great, but that was a full-length save [by Ward] and he has two hands on it, for goodness sake. How he doesn’t give that penalty is beyond me.”\n\nZaha made the most of ponderous Stoke defending when he scored the winner, latching on to a Murray flick-on from Speroni’s long kick to slot past Begovic, and Hughes admitted his side should have done better on that occasion. “It is a mistake from us. It was just a long ball and needed clearing,” the Welshman said. “If you don’t deal with the first ball, you certainly deal with the second one, and we didn’t do either. That is a disappointment, because we know we are better than that.”\n\nAlan Pardew said in his post-match press conference he had not seen a replay of the Begovic-Bolasie incident, but had no doubt it had been a “turning point” in the game. The Palace manager said: “I thought it was a cracking game and that Stoke were good – in the first period we really struggled to stay with them. The goal for us was crucial. I haven’t seen it back and I think Stoke were unhappy with it. But it was a turning point - I thought wWe were good after that.\n\n“I think it was a tough day for the officials today. I thought all of it was pretty fair, but tough – it was a tough, physical encounter, almost like a Six Nations rugby union match at times in terms of real aggression in the right way. The referee had a couple of calls to make and he was never going to get them all right because both sides were as aggressive as each other.

blew in from the south side here after six minutes and, by the time that this force of nature had departed, he had his first Premier League hat-trick and Tottenham Hotspur had the result that they wanted after Sunday’s drubbing at Manchester United.\n\nKane spent the later part of the 2012-13 season on loan at Leicester City, where he managed two goals in 13 Championship appearances and the speed of his progress remains difficult to comprehend. The 21-year-old is now carrying Tottenham’s Champions League hopes; he has his first senior England call-up for the fixtures against Lithuania and Italy and he has taken his goals tally for the season to 29. He stands to become the first Spur since Gary Lineker, in 1991-92, to reach 30.\n\nNewcastle United 1-2 Arsenal | Premier League match report Read more\n\nKane’s heroics, however, were only a part of this helter-skelter, error-strewn encounter in which Leicester contributed fully. They fought back from a dreadful start to boss the second half of the first half, equalise early in the second period and look the likelier team to win until Kane completed his hat-trick from the penalty spot and Jeff Schlupp put through his own goal after Kasper Schmeichel had blocked from Christian Eriksen.\n\nThe last time Leicester played here in the Premier League, in 2004, they drew 4-4 and they almost fashioned an unlikely repeat after David Nugent had run through Tottenham’s shambolic defence to shoot home. Mauricio Pochettino, the Tottenham manager, hurled his water bottle in fury. For a former Argentina centre-half, it cannot be easy watching this team defend.\n\nTottenham, though, just about got over the line. The turning point was the penalty, and how Leicester raged about it. Nugent took a heavy touch inside his own area and then put his arm out, making contact with Danny Rose, who went to ground.\n\nThe referee, Mike Dean, took an age to point to the spot, which was one of the things that incensed Nigel Pearson, the Leicester manager, and it felt like a soft award. Yet it was one of those that was giveable.\n\nPearson disagreed. Vehemently. He said: “Nuge would be the first to admit that he should have dealt with the situation earlier but the length of time it took to give the decision – to decide that two players colliding in the box is a penalty. I just find it bizarre. We continue to be shortchanged. We can’t be on the receiving end of so many poor decisions.”\n\nPearson tore into Dean. “The arrogance of the man is frightening. What’s the point of talking to him about it? He’s one of the most arrogant men I’ve ever met. I’ll try and keep my words carefully chosen this week and hopefully your microphone will be out of the way when I choose to say something different.”\n\nPearson gave lots of death stares in his press conference. He shrugged and stared when it was put to him that he might face Football Association censure for his outburst against Dean. The anger was stamped all over his face.\n\nKane’s second goal had taken a heavy deflection; the penalty was contentious and the own goal was deeply unfortunate. There was plenty to like about Leicester’s performance. How could they have lost, Pearson wanted to scream. Yet they did. It will be the greatest of escapes if they avoid relegation.\n\nReferee apologises after West Brom suffer red-card mistaken identity Read more\n\nTottenham were in front early through Kane, when Schmeichel pawed Eric Dier’s flick down at the striker’s feet and the second followed Robert Huth’s poor clearance. Kane’s shot deflected wickedly off Huth – it could be one for the Dubious Goals Panel.\n\nTottenham had lost Hugo Lloris in the first minute after a collision with Jamie Vardy and Kyle Walker – the goalkeeper was taken off on a stretcher and then on to hospital with what Pochettino called a “big cut on the tendon of his knee”.\n\nThe home team might have led 3-0 – Nacer Chadli blazed over the crossbar after Eriksen had hit the post – but, equally, it might have been 2-2 at half-time. Matty James sparked a lovely move that led to Nugent crossing and Vardy beating the back-up goalkeeper, Michel Vorm, and, but for Rose’s challenge, Nugent might have equalised in injury-time. Leonardo Ulloa also headed over the crossbar.\n\nIt was remarkable to see how Tottenham loosened their grip and Wes Morgan equalised following slack marking at a corner.

It had looked like Advocaat’s first game in charge of Sunderland was going to end in a dull goalless draw at Upton Park and there were a few encouraging signs for his new side, a missed chance here, a flowing move there, even a hint of something approaching defensive cohesion.\n\nSunderland were a threat in the first half and although their level dropped after the break they were resilient until Diafra Sakho plunged a dagger into their heart by snatching West Ham United’s first league win since 18 January with his 88th-minute winner.\n\nThe twist in the gut for Advocaat and Sunderland was that the referee, Lee Mason, missed an obvious foul on Sebastian Larsson by the West Ham substitute, Nene, in the moments before Sakho’s goal. “I did not expect a goal from West Ham because everything was under control,” Advocaat said. “All my players said it was a foul but I don’t want to start with blaming somebody.”\n\nSam Allardyce agreed it was a foul, not that he had much sympathy for Sunderland. “About time something went our way, rather than against us,” the West Ham manager said.\n\nAdvocaat does not have time to worry about refereeing decisions. He has eight matches to secure Sunderland’s Premier League status and the international break means the latest Dutch manager to join an English club now has a fortnight to prepare for Newcastle United’s visit to the Stadium of Light. Advocaat smiled when the derby was mentioned. “The good thing is we don’t have so many international players,” he said.\n\nThere was also support for Adam Johnson who was on the bench after Sunderland lifted his suspension following his recent arrest on suspicion of sexual activity with a 15-year-old girl. The West Ham fans sent loud boos in Johnson’s direction after his introduction in the 73rd minute, and there were a few tasteless chants from both sets of supporters throughout. “Life goes on and he did well,” Advocaat said. “He is a very good player.”\n\nThe frustration for Sunderland, who remain a point above the bottom three, was their failure to build on a promising start. Their initial approach was adventurous with Connor Wickham dangerous in a roving role behind Steven Fletcher and Jermain Defoe, and the visitors twice went close to taking the lead in the opening 15 minutes.\n\nInjuries to Winston Reid and James Tomkins forced Allardyce to play Cheikhou Kouyaté, who is primarily a midfielder, alongside James Collins in central defence and West Ham were uncertain in the early stages. Wickham stung Adrián’s palms with a volley and Defoe fired over after beating the offside trap.\n\nYou would have put your house on Defoe scoring as he drew back his right foot and prepared to shoot, but it was a poor miss from the former West Ham striker, one that betrayed Sunderland’s anxiety.\n\nAnother problem for Sunderland was seeing Wes Brown limp off after 12 minutes. He was replaced by the jittery Santiago Vergini in the visitors’ back four and West Ham began to create a few chances.\n\nSunderland’s 4-3-1-2 formation meant there was space on the flanks and West Ham almost fashioned a winger-to-winger goal, Matt Jarvis inches away from connecting with Stewart Downing’s fizzing centre from the right before Sakho’s glancing header flew just wide. Pantilimon also had to push away Alex Song’s volley from 25 yards.\n\nAfter last Saturday’s debacle against Aston Villa, at least a goalless first half represented progress of sorts for Sunderland.\n\nThat 4-0 defeat against Villa cost Gus Poyet his job and it was an afternoon when Sunderland’s players suffered a collective loss of application and discipline, their first-half performance so miserable that it caused a mass walk-out at the Stadium of Light.\n\nThis time their effort could not be faulted but Sunderland’s fluidity disappeared in the second half and West Ham, who beefed up their attack at half-time by bringing on Carlton Cole for the disappointing Jarvis, capitalised with two minutes left.\n\nNenê flattened Larsson, Mark Noble’s clever lofted pass illuminated a game that was sorely lacking in technical ability and Sakho drilled the ball past Pantilimon."}, {"date": "16/03/2015", "arena": "The Liberty Stadium", "attendance": 20828, "home_team":

prove to be a critical night in the race for a place in the top four.\n\nJordan Henderson knew little about the goal that settled the match. Liverpool rode their luck in more ways than one to leave south Wales celebrating three precious points and a fifth Premier League victory in a row.\n\nBrendan Rodgers admitted his side “weren’t anywhere near it” during a first half when the combination of Swansea’s profligacy, desperate defending and Simon Mignolet’s goalkeeping kept the visitors in the game.\n\nHenderson’s freakish goal in the 68th minute ensured Liverpool chiselled out an unlikely win and, in the process, closed the gap on United to two points before Sunday’s meeting at Anfield.\n\nRodgers said it was all about the result at a stadium where United and Arsenal lost this season. For much of the first half it looked as though Swansea would be adding Liverpool to their list of scalps but the complexion of the game changed after the interval when Rodgers tweaked his tactics, urged his players to press higher up the pitch and was able to look on with delight when fate smiled on them midway through the second half.\n\nRunning on to a flick from Daniel Sturridge, Henderson was unable to get to the ball first as Jordi Amat came across to cover and make a sliding tackle. The ball cannoned off Henderson’s right leg and looped over the head of the stranded Lukasz Fabianski. Henderson wheeled away in delight, Rodgers celebrated on the touchline and it was easy to imagine a few expletives being muttered in Manchester.\n\nAfter such a miserable start to the season everything seems to be falling into place for Liverpool at just the right time. Rodgers’ side are unbeaten in 13 league games going back to their defeat at United in December, and this clean sheet means they have gone six top-flight away games without conceding for the first time since 1972.\n\nThe last time Liverpool let a goal in on their travels in the league was when Robin van Persie scored the third in that 3-0 defeat at Old Trafford.\n\nIt has been some turnaround for Liverpool and Rodgers said Manchester City’s defeat at Burnley on Saturday means a chance to finish even higher has now opened up.\n\n“Everyone talks about fourth, but it’s the same every year for me, we do the best that we can do. And I think that Manchester City’s result gives us an opportunity to finish second,” the Liverpool manager said.\n\n“So our mentality and the run and the confidence that we have at the moment, we’ve just got to take that into every game and see where it takes us.”\n\nRodgers acknowledged it was a night for Liverpool to show other attributes. “It was a wonderful demonstration of the character and resilience in the team, especially after how we played in the first half. We just weren’t anywhere near it but that resilience and character kept us in the game. We knew we were going to be better in the second half, we changed the structure – I thought second half we really dominated the game.”\n\nIt was hard not to feel some sympathy for Swansea. Garry Monk’s side are ninth and have nothing to play for on the face of it, yet that did not look like the case in a first half when they produced some of their best football of the season. The only thing missing was a goal.\n\nChances came and went. Mignolet kept out a low shot from Bafétimbi Gomis after the Frenchman, making his first appearance since fainting at White Hart Lane 12 days ago, broke clear.\n\nThe Liverpool goalkeeper produced an even better stop to keep out a curling effort from Gylfi Sigurdsson, Martin Skrtel was in the right place at the right time to head clear on a couple of occasions and Adam Lallana deflected a Jonjo Shelvey shot behind.\n\nPlaying with a diamond shape in the second half, and much greater intensity, Liverpool became a different proposition. Fabianski made a superb save to thwart Philippe Coutinho and also denied Joe Allen, while Sturridge’s curling shot hit the post in injury time. There was nothing, however, the Swansea goalkeeper could do to stop Henderson’s bizarre winner.\n\n“Unfortunately we didn’t capitalise as we should have done in the first half,” Monk said, “and ultimately that cost us the game.”"}, {"date": "15/03/2015", "arena": "Stamford Bridge", "attendance": 41624, "home_team": {"name": "Chelsea", "lineup": [{"name": "Thibaut Courtois", "yellows": [],

from a couple of barbs about Graeme Souness and the other pundits José Mourinho sneeringly believes are “paid to wear my suit”, Chelsea were on their best behaviour and wanted everyone to see as much. Mourinho rarely left his dugout. His players kept their distance from the referee even after the borderline decision for Southampton’s penalty and the manager was a model of restraint when he was asked whether Chelsea should have had a spot kick of their own. “You will have to control me,” he said, turning to his press officer in the next seat.\n\nOn another day it was probably fair to assume there might have been a long diatribe about Chelsea’s perceived injustices. Remember, it was against Southampton in December that Mourinho first went into overdrive about a refereeing conspiracy, trying to convince us there was a “campaign” against his club and eventually copping a £25,000 fine from the Football Association because of it. The penalty Nemanja Matic conceded here will almost certainly be added to his little black book of grievances as will that moment later in the first half when the referee, Mike Dean, missed Dusan Tadic clipping Branislav Ivanovic’s heel when he was in Southampton’s box.\n\nJosé Mourinho says Arsenal are rivals to Chelsea for Premier League title Read more\n\nAll the same, it was a nice change to see Mourinho exercising some restraint despite clearly being frustrated to see his team drop points at home for the third time in four league matches. Chelsea had won the previous 10 and Mourinho’s competitive spirit made it difficult for him to reflect it had still been a profitable weekend. He should not beat himself up too much.\n\nChelsea’s lead at the top of the Premier League has stretched to six points, with a game in hand, and Southampton showed again here why they have been one of the stories of the season.\n\nRonald Koeman’s side excelled during the first half, playing with a mix of high skill and fearlessness. “Why do we have to be afraid?” Southampton’s manager said. “It’s 11 versus 11, so show your qualities.” His players followed the advice and Chelsea had to work exceedingly hard before taking control in the second half, leading to a tense finale when Fraser Forster made a series of fine saves in Southampton’s goal and John Terry had two chances in quick succession during five minutes of stoppage time.\n\nMourinho’s team had taken the lead in the 11th minute when Diego Costa headed in Ivanovic’s cross for his first goal in eight matches but Tadic’s penalty came not long afterwards and for the rest of the first half Southampton played with the kind of enterprise that is usually beyond visiting sides at Stamford Bridge.\n\nThey did not keep the ball so well in the second half but it would still have been desperately harsh if they had succumbed to that late pressure, no matter how much lingering doubt there was about the penalty.\n\nMatic was booked for the challenge on Sadio Mané but his outstretched leg did reach the ball as he and Ivanovic converged on Southampton’s quick, elusive forward. Ivanovic was chasing Mané and if anything it was probably his presence that put Mané off balance. Dean, however, clearly thought it was Matic’s foul.\n\nChelsea have lost their rhythm, and none more so than Cesc Fàbregas | Dominic Fifield Read more\n\nKoeman had left out his leading scorer, Graziano Pellè, because of the deterioration in the Italian’s performances since Christmas and Shane Long’s indefatigable running was a prominent feature as Southampton dominated until half-time. Nathaniel Clyne and Ryan Bertrand attacked from the full-back positions, Victor Wanyama and Morgan Schneiderlin dovetailed with great expertise in midfield and Mané was always a difficult opponent.\n\nCosta’s goal was a throwback to those days earlier in the season when he was expected to score in almost every game. He is not, though, the marauding force we saw in the autumn and early winter. Cesc Fàbregas is struggling to recapture his best form and this was an off-day for Matic, who could feasibly have been sent off for another foul on Mané in the opening moments of the second half. Mourinho removed him not long afterwards.\n\nChelsea certainly took their time working up any real momentum but Eden Hazard came alive in the second half. Koeman accepted afterwards “you need luck” and Chelsea could look back on that moment in the 57th minute when Willian let fly and Costa threw himself at the misdirected shot only for the ball to squirt upwards and flick off the post. Forster excelled in the last half an hour and Southampton defended with great defiance.\n\nMan of the match: Morgan Schneiderlin (Southampton)"}, {"date": "15/03/2015", "arena": "Goodison Park", "attendance": 38806, "home_team": {"name": "Everton", "lineup": [{"name": "Tim Howard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Seamus Coleman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Antolin Alcaraz", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Jagielka", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leighton Baines", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Lennon", "yellows": [79], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [85]}, {"name": "James McCarthy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [20], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [86]}, {"name": "Darron Gibson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leon Osman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Romelu Lukaku", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [56], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [74]}, {"name": "Arouna Kone", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Joel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Naismith", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Muhamed Besic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [86], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Atsu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [85], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ross Barkley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [90], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [74], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Stones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Luke Garbutt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Newcastle United", "lineup": [{"name": "Tim Krul", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daryl Janmaat", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mike Williamson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fabricio Coloccini", "yellows": [], "reds": [59], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Taylor", "yellows": [29], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Moussa Sissoko", "yellows": [55], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Colback", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gabriel Obertan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Yoan Gouffran", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sammy Ameobi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [58]}, {"name": "Emmanuel Riviere", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [62]}], "subs": [{"name": "Vurnon Anita", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ayoze Pérez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonás Gutiérrez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [62], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rémy Cabella", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [58], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rob Elliot", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Armstrong", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lubomir Satka", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "The pressure was on yet it never told on Everton. Anxiety gripped players and supporters alike in the Europa League on Thursday but aided and abetted by Newcastle United’s self-destruction, Roberto Martínez’s men eased their relegation concerns with a composed, controlled and clinical victory. “We had no fear,” said a hugely encouraged Everton manager.\n\nNewcastle proved to be ideal guests for a team seeking to re-establish a six-point gap between themselves and the relegation zone. Tim Krul dived out of the way of James McCarthy’s first goal of the season, Yoan Gouffran conceded a needless penalty to gift Romelu Lukaku his 17th goal of the campaign and the United captain, Fabricio Coloccini, was sent off for a two-footed foul on Aaron Lennon before Ross Barkley completed the scoring in stoppage time. “It was reckless, high and you could tell by the reaction of the Newcastle players that they thought it was a red card,” said Martínez.\n\n“I thought from the reaction of the Everton players that it must be a red but I’ve watched it four or five times on a laptop and it is not conclusive,” contradicted John Carver, the Newcastle interim manager.\n\nNewcastle were as compliant as a team with one win in nine away games would suggest but considering the stakes for Martínez and Everton, this was a calm and confident step forward in the Premier League. The manager made five changes to the team that started against Dynamo Kyiv and altered his formation too. The tireless Lennon, Lukaku and Arouna Koné led a refreshed performance while the return of Leon Osman and Darron Gibson brought noticeable improvement in the range and speed of passing from central midfield.\n\nLukaku had called on his team-mates to continue where they left off against Dynamo and dictate the play but Newcastle made the more aggressive start and almost took the lead inside three minutes. Gabriel Obertan was denied at close range by Tim Howard from a Ryan Taylor corner. The rebound fell to Mike Williamson, who appealed strongly for a penalty when his shot appeared to strike McCarthy’s arm on the goal-line. The midfielder’s limb was across his chest when the incident occurred and the referee, Martin Atkinson, ignored Williamson’s protests. “It could have been a lot different if it had been a penalty and they were down to 10 men,” said Carver. “But 11 v 11 we were second best.”\n\nMcCarthy’s lack of goals, even attempts on goal, is well-documented but he read Lukaku’s intentions perfectly when the centre-forward collected Phil Jagielka’s long ball and invited the midfielder to run into space. McCarthy took the lay-off, advanced and shot straight at Krul who completely misread the direction of the ball and dived away from it. The midfielder had his first goal at Goodison Park.\n\nMartínez’s men have dropped more points from winning positions this season than any other Premier League team but they were gifted the comfort of a second by Gouffran. Attempting to trick his way out of Newcastle’s penalty area, the forward failed to spot Lennon closing in and sent the on-loan winger sprawling having been dispossessed. Lukaku sent Krul the wrong way from the spot.\n\nThe visitors’ day deteriorated further three minutes later when Coloccini invited a straight red card for a two-footed lunge on the impressive Lennon. Everton had chances to punish the 10-man but Krul saved well from Koné and Osman while Ryan Taylor blocked from the substitute Barkley on the goal-line.\n\nTo their credit, Newcastle finished strongly and it took a superb save from Howard to deny Moussa Sissoko plus an equally fine challenge from Antolín Alcaraz to prevent Rémy Cabella setting up a nervous finale. Barkley did get his goal in stoppage time, however, when fellow sub Christian Atsu broke from halfway and threaded a fine pass into the midfielder’s stride. Barkley rounded Krul before sealing a vital win for Everton. “The opening 20 minutes on Thursday were as bad as it can get but all of a sudden we found enjoyment in our play again and how we should perform,” said Martínez. “We carried that on today when there could have been extra pressure. I think Thursday could be a real turning point for us.”\n\nMan of the match Aaron Lennon (Everton)"}, {"date": "15/03/2015", "arena": "Old Trafford", "attendance": 75112, "home_team": {"name": "Manchester United", "lineup": [{"name": "David De Gea", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Antonio Valencia", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Smalling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Jones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daley Blind", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Carrick", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [19], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [87]}, {"name": "Juan Mata", "yellows": [32], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [77]}, {"name": "Ander Herrera", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marouane Fellaini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [9], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [83]}, {"name": "Ashley Young", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wayne Rooney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [34], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Rafael", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [87], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Falcao", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [83], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adnan Januzaj", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Anders Lindegaard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tyler Blackett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andreas Pereira", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [77], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Wilson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Tottenham Hotspur", "lineup": [{"name": "Hugo Lloris", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Walker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eric Dier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jan Vertonghen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Rose", "yellows": [72], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nabil Bentaleb", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Mason", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [64]}, {"name": "Andros Townsend", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [31]}, {"name": "Christian Eriksen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nacer Chadli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [79]}, {"name": "Harry Kane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Vlad Chiriches", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paulinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Emmanuel Adebayor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [79], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Erik Lamela", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [64], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michel Vorm", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mousa Dembélé", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [31], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Davies", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "This was an afternoon when the Louis van Gaal “philosophy” finally appeared crystal clear. As in old times under Sir Alex Ferguson, Manchester United were an unstoppable force that went for the jugular to allow Tottenham Hotspur no chance of affecting the contest.\n\nThe vital factor here was the component missing in action for most of the season: tempo. Where this collection of United players who have seemed in a permanent torpor found the zest from is intriguing, and the manager will surely demand this be the benchmark in the final nine games that are crucial to Champions League qualification hopes. The victory gives United a firmer grip on fourth place, putting five points between them and Liverpool – who travel to Swansea on Monday night – and a further one to Spurs, whose hopes of a top-four finish appear moribund.\n\nWayne Rooney and Louis van Gaal play down boxing story after United win Read more\n\nAsked if this was United’s best performance since he arrived, Van Gaal said: “I have to watch the video again. I have to say we played like a team and very determined. Maybe now is the game that gives us a fantastic boost.”\n\nThe manager believes it could galvanise the players. “I hope so. We have waited a long time for such a victory,” he said.\n\nThe opening question in Sunday’s game, as is the case in these Van Gaal days, was how they would line up. On this occasion the answer was a 4-1-4-1 formation which, in the latest bit of tinkering, featured Daley Blind at left-back and Juan Mata on the right side of midfield; each of these hardly their regular positions.\n\nThe first opening came within two minutes and arrived along Blind’s flank though the Dutchman was blameless. Phil Jones was the culprit, the defender’s heavy backpass requiring David de Gea to scramble and stick out a boot to prevent an own goal. The alarm bells rung were turned up higher when the ensuing corner had to be scrambled away by Marouane Fellaini and the thought arose that this could be another painful outing for United.\n\nBy the time – after 34 minutes – that Rooney had scored a barnstorming third for United this was all forgotten. What passed in the intervening moments was a passage of play that was certainly the best seen under Van Gaal’s leadership.\n\nRooney’s fifth goal in six games came from a shocking ball from Nabil Bentaleb that went straight to the United captain. Now came the sight of the Rooney of yore, the England captain charging at the backpedalling Spurs rearguard before he made a mug of Eric Dier, removing him from the equation by swerving left and beating Hugo Lloris with a cool finish to the goalkeeper’s right. The celebration? A few shadow punches and a fall backwards in jest at being knocked out by Stoke City’s Phil Bardsley in the kitchen last month.\n\nFellaini revealed that Rooney had given a rousing speech to the players at the team hotel on Saturday that was “very important” and had inspired the squad.\n\nPace was the key to the iron grip United had on the visitors’ throats. And in Fellaini United had a player who turned in a near-perfect first-half performance whether heading on a high pass or zooming into space to cross, or scoring, as he did after nine minutes to register United’s opening goal.\n\nThis derived from a smooth Blind ball to Michael Carrick – impressive in a first league start for two months – whose own pass found Fellaini and the Belgian made no mistake with a finish that had Old Trafford in raptures and him beating the United crest on his chest.\n\nIt was the Fellaini head that had a starring role in the second. As with Rooney’s goal, the Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino will be bitterly disappointed at his side’s defending. Mata swung over a corner and Fellaini rose to bully Dier and head towards Lloris’s goal. Nacer Chadli hooked the ball away and out to Carrick, whose placement of his header to Lloris’s left was supreme.\n\nLouis van Gaal gets passing combination right for Manchester United win | Michael Cox Read more\n\nRooney’s third was followed by the home crowd chanting “attack, attack, attack” as Old Trafford had been taken back to the days when the relentless red blur was the norm.\n\nIn Tottenham, United had an opponent in name only. If the watching Roy Hodgson was present to assess Harry Kane’s readiness for inclusion in his England squad on Thursday he will have learned little as English football’s coming man was offered barely a sniff of an opening from his insipid team-mates.\n\nHow Pochettino will wish he had even one player on the excellent Fellaini’s level. Instead, so desperate did the visiting manager become that the forgotten man of Spurs, Emmanuel Adebayor, was given a first run-out since 22 January as a second-half replacement.\n\nVan Gaal could afford to give young Andreas Pereira a league debut, and he ended the 90 minutes particularly content. As Manchester City are now only two points ahead the Dutchman could even discuss how United’s great rivals are back in what he calls the “rat race” to secure European Cup football next season.\n\n“Of course [City are in range] because Arsenal is one point behind [City] and we are two points behind. It is good for us and the fans and the media because you can write a lot of things down,” said the 63-year-old manager.\n\nMan of the match Marouane Fellaini (Manchester United)"}, {"date":

to save themselves from the drop and a couple of wins could lift them out of the bottom three, but performances such as this strengthen the suspicion that they have neither the ability nor the belief to survive.\n\nThis match was supposed to represent a chance for Rangers to show they should not be written off so soon. Crystal Palace, though beginning eight points above the visitors, are still theoretically in trouble themselves and had not won at home since Alan Pardew’s first game in charge back in January. But it quickly transpired that Rangers could kid no one, as they were blown away by half-time thanks to goals by Wilfried Zaha, James McArthur and Joel Ward. Matt Phillips, in fairness, struck back for the visitors with a phenomenal goal from over 40 yards towards the end – and it will take something equally freakish for Rangers to get out of trouble.\n\nThe Rangers head coach, Chris Ramsey, had said he was sick of reciting hard-luck stories, with relatively decent recent displays offering no consolation for a streak of four defeats from his five matches at the helm prior to this. There was no need for him to point to misfortune here, as his team fully deserved their clobbering. “I’m very disappointed,” he said afterwards. “We really have to do better.”\n\nPartly because of injuries and partly, perhaps, out of desperation, Ramsey made radical alterations to the side that began last week’s home defeat by Tottenham Hotspur. He tried again to harness Adel Taarabt’s oft-hidden talent by recalling the Moroccan for the first time in over a month and, most remarkably, he gave Shaun Wright-Phillips his first start since August’s Capital One Cup defeat by Burton Albion. It was, indeed, Wright-Phillips’ first start in the top flight for 770 days, which is the average life expectancy of a store-bought hamster or, more pertinently, roughly the time it takes a club to get relegated from the Premier League, come back up and get relegated again.\n\nThe first 20 minutes drifted by like a paper bag in the chilly breeze. As soon as Palace introduced urgency, they took the lead. Glenn Murray released Yannick Bolasie with a pass from the centre circle. The winger galloped down the left and sent a low ball across the face of goal. Zaha and Jason Puncheon threw themselves at it and the former Manchester United player poked it into the net before he, Puncheon and the bystanding Rangers defender Yun Suk-young collided painfully with the post.\n\nMcArthur and Murray both came close to increasing the hosts’ lead as Rangers struggled to deliver any counter-punches. Taarabt twinkled occasionally and came closest to giving the visitors a first-half goal, as he sent a 25-yard drive over the bar.\n\nPalace’s second goal arrived in the 40th minute via a similar route to the first. The irrepressible Bolasie supplied another low cross from the left and this time McArthur applied the decisive touch from close range. Ninety seconds later QPR’s collapse was complete. Ward ignored a weak challenge from young Darnell Furlong as two more experienced Rangers’ players loitered in the vicinity with little intent, then Ward made his way into the box and struck a shot that deflected off Sandro into the net. It was Ward’s first goal on his 90th league appearance for Palace and ensured that even the most deluded Rangers supporter did not go into the break thinking the visitors could mount a comeback.\n\nRangers at least showed a degree of pride and did not fold in the second half. They registered their first shot on target in the 71st minute, when a Charlie Austin header from seven yards prompted a reminder that Palace had fielded a goalkeeper, Julián Speroni clutching the striker’s effort easily.\n\nThen came Phillips’ reminder that, no matter how badly things seem to be going, in football a team should never abandon hope. After winning the ball in the centre circle, he wriggled a few yards forward before whacking an extraordinary shot past Speroni and into the top corner. He almost scored again before the end – from a mere 25 yards this time – but Speroni palmed his drive behind for a corner. Ramsey says he and the players still believe they can keep Rangers up. “I’m hoping nine games is enough because that’s all I’ve got. The players are disappointed but there’s no bickering and moaning at each other. We’re still unified in what we’re trying.”"}, {"date": "14/03/2015", "arena": "Emirates Stadium", "attendance": 60002, "home_team": {"name": "Arsenal", "lineup": [{"name": "David Ospina", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Calum Chambers", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Per Mertesacker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Laurent Koscielny", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nacho Monreal", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Ramsey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [81], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Francis Coquelin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Theo Walcott", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [72]}, {"name": "Mesut Özil", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [83]}, {"name": "Alexis Sánchez", "yellows": [36], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [65]}, {"name": "Olivier Giroud", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [45], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Wojciech Szczesny", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kieran Gibbs", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Santi Cazorla", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [72], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mathieu Flamini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [84], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [83], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Welbeck", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [65], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chuba Akpom", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Hector Bellerin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "West Ham United", "lineup": [{"name": "Adrián", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joey O'Brien", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Collins", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cheikhou Kouyaté", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Cresswell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mark Noble", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [82]}, {"name": "Alex Song", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stewart Downing", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin Nolan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matthew Jarvis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [75]}, {"name": "Diafra Sakho", "yellows": [78], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Nene", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [82], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Guy Demel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Morgan Amalfitano", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [75], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jussi Jaaskelainen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Diego Poyet", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Josh Cullen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Emmanuel Onariase", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Arsenal made it five Premier League wins in a row here with a straightforward victory against a well-drilled but pallid West Ham.

Moments later the Emirates saw the first glimpse of more progressive things from this high-throttle forward line as Walcott sprinted across halfway and funnelled the ball on to Sánchez, who checked back on to his right and the chance was gone.\n\nFor West Ham Matt Jarvis returned on the left of midfield and Joey O’Brien stepped in at right back in a 4-5-1 formation designed with gristly defence in mind at a ground where, despite his reputation for Wenger-baiting, Sam Allardyce has never won a game in 12 attempts.\n\nWest Ham did show some nice touches in attack at times. With 22 minutes gone Kevin Nolan, who until then had occupied himself by simply bumping into Özil at every opportunity, might have opened the scoring. Jarvis crossed from the byline and Nolan’s well judged volley brought a swift low save from David Ospina.\n\nArsenal continued to press and 12 minutes before half-time Walcott found himself again through on goal, following a fine through pass from Ramsey. This time Walcott shot straight at Adrián. The chances continued to come, the next after a dreamy exchange of passes between Özil, Walcott and Ramsey, at the end of which Sánchez’s fine volley drew an equally good save. There was still time for Walcott to miss another presentable chance before Giroud finally made it 1-0 just before half time. It was a beautiful goal too, as Özil and Ramsey exchanged passes, Ramsey’s dart and Özil’s sliderule through ball leaving Giroud with just enough angle to shoot hard into the top corner across Adrián.\n\nJosé Mourinho can drive Chelsea to title by releasing the handbrake Read more\n\nIt was fitting reward for a first half in which Arsenal enjoyed 74% of the possession and had 12 shots at goal. But West Ham did offer a little more after half-time, Mark Noble and Alex Song taking a grip of central midfield and the hitherto invisible Diafra Sakho showing his mobility and touch across the frontline.\n\nSeeking a little extra muscle, Wenger brought on Danny Welbeck for Sánchez and Santi Cazorla for Walcott, who as so often looked a high-pedigree footballer here 95% of the time, that missing 5% usually involving either shooting at goal or finding a final pass.\n\nStill Arsenal stitched together some lovely moves, with Özil’s passing at times drawing gurgles of approval, although he really should have shot rather than crossed after a fine exchange with Welbeck left him clear in the penalty area.\n\nWith eight minutes left Ramsey finally made it 2-0 after another sensational combination with Giroud, a one-two after a throw-in leaving Ramsey in on goal for a sweet close-range finish. And within two minutes it was 3-0, Mathieu Flamini scrambling the ball in from a cross by Cazorla for his first goal since last March.\n\nAsked if Giroud, who was outstanding here, will get the chance to redeem a horrible first-leg display against Monaco, Wenger offered a guarded endorsement: “This is a boy who played at 23 years of age in the second division and who comes out and becomes an international player. You have to show some special strength to do that.”"}, {"date": "14/03/2015", "arena": "The King Power Stadium", "attendance": 31456, "home_team": {"name": "Leicester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Mark

side in trouble, despite playing at home and against 10 men for the final 20 minutes, the last thing you want is to look up to see a highly successful predecessor sitting alongside the owner. Martin O’Neill’s presence at the King Power was, according to a Leicester City spokesman, the merest coincidence but, having already been sacked and reinstated once this season, Nigel Pearson desperately needed a much better performance than his players produced here.\n\nFor long periods, certainly before the dismissal of Tom Huddlestone with 18 minutes remaining, they were outplayed by the Tigers, and had the Hull striker Nikica Jelavic not missed an absolute sitter in the first half, and Foxes goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer not made an outstanding late save from Abel Hernández two minutes from time, all hope of survival would surely have been extinguished.\n\n“We’ve got 10 games left, six at home, and probably need to win five,” was said Pearson. “Our home form has to be drastically improved, and that’s it. We needed to be a bit more committed to our attacking play. If the players had a bit of an off-day, they had a bit off an off-day, and that’s that.”\n\nIt was a reaction that will be shared by many of the supporters. While the results have often been disappointing this season, the performances have rarely been less than committed and determined, but neither of those qualities were particularly apparent here.\n\nPearson kept faith with the three centre-back formation he believes is the best way of giving his side the defensive solidity they have so often lacked this season, but this time in a genuine 3-5-2 formation, the experienced trio of Robert Huth, Matthew Upson and much-criticised captain Wes Morgan operating with Ritchie De Laet and Jeffrey Schlupp pushing up on either side. He also added pace, in the shape of Jamie Vardy, to work with Andrej Kramaric up front.\n\nPearson’s opposite number, Steve Bruce, also opted for an attacking 3-5-2, suggesting openness and width was intended to be the order of the day, an impression borne out in an opening few minutes, in which play swung from penalty area to penalty area with bewildering speed.\n\nIn terms of chances created, however, the presence on the pitch of six tall, old-fashioned centre-halves ensured crosses were very much delivered in hope rather than expectation. Schwarzer should have had to, though. Huddlestone’s through ball was beautifully timed, and turned perfectly across goal by Ahmed Elmohamady so that the unmarked Jelavic, no more than six yards from goal, had only to make a clean connection to turn it past Schwarzer. Somehow the Croat failed to do so, a candidate for miss of this and many another season.\n\nHull did begin to exert a measure of control, though, Huddlestone in particular looking something like the player he did last season. Andrej Kramaric’s badly sliced shot after 36 minutes was the home team’s first serious effort on goal. Leicester had to improve, and after half-time, briefly did, Esteban Cambiasso playing his way into the Hull penalty area only to see his low shot blocked by a sliding Michael Dawson. The pattern of the game soon re-established itself, however, and again Jelavic should have done better than flash a header over from a Gastón Ramírez corner instead of under Schwarzer’s bar on the hour.\n\nDame N’Doye shot when Jelavic was in a better position, but the dismissal of Hudddlestone for a second yellow card with 20 minutes remaining changed the game. Now it was Hull’s turn to hang on, and Leonardo Ulloa, on for Kramaric, inadvertently blocked a Schlupp shot that looked to be goalbound. At the other end, Hernández, seizing on Dame N’Doye’s quickly taken free-kick two minutes before the end, should have won the game, but Schwarzer made a fine diving save to his right.\n\n“The match will be last on Match of the Day, and rightly so, but we had the best of the chances,” said Bruce, going on to bemoan the number of yellow cards and the sending-off in a game he insisted didn’t really have a single nasty challenge. “Jelavic has won us so many games, so that chance is one of those unfortunate ones he’s beating himself up about.”"}, {"date": "14/03/2015", "arena": "Stadium of Light",

and the boos were not as loud as they might have been but protests rarely prove this dramatic. The demonstration of discontent staged by Sunderland fans took the form of a mass exodus, with a ground that had been filled with 45,746 spectators appearing half empty by the interval.\n\nEvery vacant plastic red seat served as a reproach to Gus Poyet on a day when his stuttering side simply surrendered, conceding four goals to Tim Sherwood’s renascent Aston Villa in the first 45 minutes.\n\nGabriel Agbonlahor of Aston Villa celebrates scoring their second goal at Sunderland. Photograph: Jan Kruger/Getty Images\n\nIt leaves Ellis Short, Sunderland’s owner, with a very big decision to make. Short and his board had hoped Poyet could limp on in charge until the end of the season but, even though the team remain just above the bottom three, that likelihood must have receded.\n\nA couple of minutes after the final whistle Poyet paused near the mouth of the tunnel, half-turned and took a lingering look around the near-deserted stadium. The body language seemed that of a man who sensed his time was up.\n\nSherwood’s tenure has begun on a much more optimistic note with a third straight victory suggesting Villa’s relegation worries will soon be banished.\n\nUnlike Poyet, Sherwood’s default mode is adventure and his 4-4-2 formation duly offered Villa real width allied to plenty of crosses for Christian Benteke and Gabriel Agbonlahor.\n\nSure enough a pleasingly fluent passing move concluded with Leandro Bacuna advancing from right-back and crossing low in Benteke’s direction. Within seconds a wrongfooted Costel Pantilimon was beaten courtesy of the centre-forward’s first-time, 10-yard sidefoot.\n\nAlmost immediately, Villa scored again. By way of variation it was a very different type of goal featuring John O’Shea’s misjudgment of Ciaran Clark’s long, high punt forward.\n\nGus Poyet takes responsibility after Sunderland loss triggers fan protest Read more\n\nThe ball fell kindly to Agbonlahor, who was left one-on-one with Pantilimon, and made no mistake in directing an angled shot into the back of the net.\n\nBoos became audible but it could have been far worse had Scott Sinclair not lent back and skied a close-range shot over the bar when it seemed easier to score. Once again that opening was created by Bacuna’s cross and by now it was abundantly evident that Sherwood had instructed his right-back to join Charles N’Zogbia in attacking Sunderland’s defensively vulnerable left flank at every opportunity.\n\nIf Bacuna was enjoying an excellent game so, too, was Agbonlahor. He scored his second after collecting Nzogbia’s delivery, cutting inside one tentative marker and then brushing past a hesitant Wes Brown before shooting low, and powerfully, beyond Pantilimon.\n\nAlmost before the Romanian could retrieve the ball from the back of his net a significant number of Sunderland fans had begun streaming towards the exits. Poyet retreated to his dugout where he sat slumped back in his seat, arms folded and eyes fixed firmly on the sky.\n\nA few feet away a season ticket and a red and white scarf were hurled to the ground before stewards ushered their former owner away from the Uruguayan’s immediate orbit.\n\nSoon the police were involved, joining stewards to form a tight cordon behind the home bench and discouraging the growing band of locals who seemed keen to provide Poyet with helpful hints.\n\nHow Sunderland’s manager must have wished a magic carpet could land at his feet and whisk him away to almost anywhere else in the world. Such feelings can only have intensified when Benteke connected with yet another Bacuna cross and directed a header beyond Pantilimon from six yards.\n\nChristian Benteke puts Aston Villa 2-0 up against Sunderland in the Premier League at the Stadium of Light. Photograph: Neville Williams/Aston Villa FC via Getty Images\n\nThe keeper later did well to repel N’Zogbia’s capriciously curling second-half shot in impressive fashion but, by then, the sense of chaos had spread from Sunderland’s central midfield to the popular seats.\n\nWhile the sight of Roy Keane watching his old teams from the stand prompted a rash of theories that he was poised to return to Wearside in a caretaker manager capacity until the end of the season, confusion reigned as Sebastian Larsson failed to reappear at the start of the second period.\n\nSunderland were down to 10 men for fives minutes because medics were struggling to stitch a nasty leg wound suffered by the Swede. The collective mental scars sustained by Poyet and his players promise to be considerably harder to treat but, with Villa relaxing a little, they did at least manage to hit a post, Steven Fletcher’s shot beating Brad Guzan but not the woodwork.\n\nThat Fletcher injured himself in the act of shooting seemed thoroughly emblematic of the self-destruction which has afflicted so many key personnel at

"Brown Ideye’s first-half winner sealed a narrow 1-0 victory for West Bromwich Albin as Tony Pulis returned to haunt Stoke again. The striker’s seventh goal of the season settled the game to move the Baggies 11 points clear of the Premier League relegation zone.\n\nEx-Potters manager Pulis – who also beat Stoke 1-0 while at Crystal Palace last season – saw Albion recover from back-to-back defeats against Aston Villa.\n\nThey were also denied a penalty after Craig Dawson appeared to be fouled in the box and Ideye had a goal disallowed.\n\nThe Potters, who remain eighth, were poor but Jonathan Walters did force substitute goalkeeper Boaz Myhill into a smart second-half save.\n\nBen Foster, Darren Fletcher and Stephane Sessegnon were all recalled for Albion as Myhill and Jonas Olsson dropped to the bench while Claudio Yacob was banned.\n\nRyan Shawcross returned for the first time since January after a back problem and replaced Philipp Wollscheid, who was out with a groin injury. But, despite the return of their captain, Stoke were rattled early as Albion looked for the breakthrough.\n\nAsmir Begovic turned Saido Berahino’s shot wide and then claimed the forward’s drive as the Baggies dominated. Victor Moses fired over but the visitors were ragged, unable to gain enough possession or territory to make a meaningful impact. And Albion took advantage after 19 minutes when Ideye ended his four-game goal drought.\n\nIt took some shocking defending from Phil Bardsley, though, to give the home side the lead as the defender backed off Ideye, allowing him to stoop and nod Craig Gardner’s cross into the corner from 10 yards.\n\nAlbion deserved the lead and Stoke did little to suggest they would fight their way back before the break.\n\nAnd they survived a scare when Ideye had a goal ruled out – correctly – for offside, after Begovic had spilled the ball in the 35th minute.\n\nBegovic’s mistake was symptomatic of the disjointed Stoke display with the hosts well on top. But the Baggies suffered a blow 10 minutes into the second half when Foster was forced off after landing awkwardly, to be replaced by Myhill.\n\nBerahino headed wide as the hosts reacted well but Stoke had improved since the break and began to pin their hosts back. Myhill turned Walters’ header over after 62 minutes before the goalkeeper and Gareth McAuley were forced into scrambling clearances.\n\nIt was a brief recovery from the visitors, though, as they faded badly.\n\nBegovic produced a fine low save to deny Ideye a second with 25 minutes left and West Brom should have had a penalty 10 minutes later.\n\nDawson collected Sessègnon’s knockdown only to be felled by Geoff Cameron but referee Michael Oliver ignored the claims.\n\nThe hosts had regained their composure after a second-half wobble and Myhill claimed Peter Crouch’s header.\n\nAnd Albion survived one final scare in stoppage time when Myhill clattered into Crouch just outside the area and was booked but the Baggies hung on."}, {"date": "14/03/2015", "arena": "Turf Moor", "attendance":

Sean Dyche’s side were unable to climb out of the bottom three with victory over Manchester City, but are now just a point behind the side in 17th and in no danger of changing their manager. City will now be officially concentrating on making progress in Europe, where they must overcome a 2-1 deficit from the first leg to survive at Camp Nou on Wednesday. In truth this was such a lethargic, uninspired display from the visitors it was tempting to suppose they had already made that decision before kick-off.\n\nTake nothing away from Burnley, though. They were as tenacious as they have been all season and when they finally realised they had an opportunity against City they took their chance, seized the lead and defended it well.\n\nManchester City’s Manuel Pellegrini won’t concede title after Burnley loss Read more\n\n“We need to improve,” Manuel Pellegrini said, stating the obvious. “It was not a good day for us, Burnley only created one chance and it won them the game. We needed to create more.”\n\nVincent Kompany was restored to the City lineup after missing the last game against Leicester, but there was no place for Wilfried Bony with Edin Dzeko starting alongside Sergio Agüero. Both teams matched each other in the midfield areas for the first half hour without managing to create anything likely to lead to a goal. Jesús Navas made a couple of promising runs down the right but could not come up with the cross his team-mates were looking for while, apart from an optimistic Danny Ings appeal for a penalty for handball, most of Burnley’s moves broke down even further from the area.\n\nOne could understand City’s caution with Barcelona to come, though as Dyche was at pains to point out in the match programme, Burnley now need to turn good performances into points, for praise for their attitude and commitment will not keep them in the division. The home side had no need to be in awe of their visitors, having earned a point in a 2-2 draw at the Etihad in December, and really should have been having a go to test whether City were keeping something in reserve.\n\nIt took half an hour for either goalkeeper to be called on to make a save, then Tom Heaton had to produce two in quick succession to deny Dzeko and Agüero. Scott Arfield brought Joe Hart into action at the other end before City squandered the best opportunity of the first half. A goal appeared certain when David Silva, already in a good position to shoot, craftily slipped the ball forward for Dzeko to make sure, only for the striker to let the ball run and miss his chance.\n\nAgüero tried to retreive the situation – proof that City had more than enough finishers on hand to take advantage of momentary Burnley disarray – though, forced away from goal, he shot from a narrow angle and missed the target.\n\nA Manchester City fan proposed to his Burnley supporting girlfriend on the pitch at half-time, in what looked suspiciously like a pre-arranged stunt but was nevertheless more entertaining than anything the first 45 minutes had offered. The lady said yes, and the crowd responded with a burst of: “You don’t know what you’re doing.”\n\nThe prospective bridegroom pushed his luck by tipping City to win, though the visitors could have taken the lead shortly after the interval when Agüero turned Kieran Trippier on the halfway line but delayed his pass to an unmarked Silva a fraction too long.\n\nArsenal 3-0 West Ham United | Premier League match report Read more\n\nBurnley showed more attacking adventure in the second half and George Boyd fired narrowly wide with a difficult volley from the edge of the area before Ben Mee was slightly harshly booked for a challenge on Navas. It was nothing like as bad as the challenge by Martín Demichelis on Ings that quite rightly led to the Argentinian defender being cautioned a couple of minutes later and contributed to Burnley taking the lead. From the free-kick, angled into the area by Trippier, Kompany’s clearing header only found Boyd on the edge of the area and the winger drilled a low left-footed shot straight and true into Hart’s bottom left corner.\n\nThe goalkeeper was possibly unsighted at first as the penalty area was crowded, though Boyd did well to keep the shot down and pick the one spot that Hart might not have been able to reach anyway.\n\nCity wasted no time in bringing Bony on after that, withdrawing the ineffective Dzeko. Stevan Jovetic and, soon after, Frank Lampard also joined the fray, yet the closest City came was an Agüero header that flew just too high. Mee was lucky to get away with bringing down Pablo Zabaleta in the penalty area in stoppage time. While not the most obvious foul, he did not seem to get much of the ball, but the referee waved play on and Burnley held on for a famous victory.\n\n“It’s about time something went our way after all the misfortunes we’ve had this season,” Dyche said. “I don’t think anyone could question we showed the desire to win the game.”"}, {"date": "07/03/2015", "arena": "Kiyan Prince Foundation Stadium",

celebrating away fans. Every picture tells a story and the Tottenham manager spoke of his club’s joy at staying in contention for Champions League qualification. He might want to put that shot in an album alongside a portrait of Harry Kane, who delivered three points by scoring his 15th and 16th Premier League goals in a spectacular breakthrough season. Surely the 21-year-old will feature in an England squad photo soon.\n\n“He’s fantastic, he scored two goals and he has changed my opinion of him,” said Pochettino of a striker who at one stage seemed destined for a move away from Tottenham, having been farmed out on loan four times over the years. “He’s young and he can improve more,” said Pochettino, ominously for Tottenham’s future opponents.\n\nThe clash of the Premier League’s top two English goalscorers was a subplot in this high-stakes showdown, and Roy Hodgson turned up to run the rule over Kane and Charlie Austin. Both featured prominently, although the outcome also owed much to the contrast between the goalkeepers’ fortunes, as Hugo Lloris enjoyed the rub of the green that his Rangers counterpart lacked. And home fans may want to issue a Not Wanted poster for the referee, Craig Pawson, who rejected two strong penalty appeals.\n\nAn indication that things would go Lloris’s way came in the first minute, when he tipped a Bobby Zamora header over the bar and escaped without conceding a corner, as the referee seemingly thought the header had gone straight out. Four minutes later, Austin tried his luck from 20 yards but Zamora inadvertently blocked his team-mate’s well-hit shot.\n\nQuality was in short supply in the first half but the looseness of the game meant both sides got chances. In the sixth minute Kyle Walker presented Kane with an early opportunity to impress the watching England manager but instead Hodgson must have admired the reactions of Rob Green, who showed terrific reflexes to beat away the forward’s close-range header. Green could be forgiven for wishing Hodgson had left at that point – because in the 34th minute the goalkeeper charged off his line in a misguided attempt to cut out a cross from Andros Townsend. Nedum Onuoha, seemingly sensing his approach, ducked out of the way, but Green never got near the ball and Kane nodded it into the net unchallenged.\n\nSpurs had almost made things equally easy for Austin before that, as Walker carelessly headed the ball to the striker in front of goal. But Lloris repelled Austin’s flicked shot and then dived to tip the ball off his feet. Moments later Austin did beat the goalkeeper but his shot from 16 yards crashed back out off the bar.\n\nLuck smiled on Lloris again in the 39th minute, when he got away with a foul in the box on Mauricio Isla. The goalkeeper hurtled off his line and clipped the Chilean’s leg while performing a wild star jump, but again the referee apparently missed the Frenchman’s intervention.\n\nSpurs, playing their sixth match in 17 days, were looking a little sluggish. Christian Eriksen, normally their most inventive player, was a passenger for the first period but he started taking control early in the second as Spurs improved markedly. In the 47th minute the Dane let fly with a wonderful long-range shot that flew past Green and bounced back off the post. Kane bungled the follow-up.\n\nWith so much at stake, tempers began to fray. Pochettino stepped on to the pitch to drag Ryan Mason away from trouble after an angry confrontation with Karl Henry. Mason, another young English player whose performance must have pleased Hodgson, then helped give Spurs serenity. In the 68th minute the 23-year-old flighted a perfect pass over the Rangers defence. Rio Ferdinand, having utterly lost his bearings, simply stopped, and Kane was allowed to canter into the box and around Green before slotting into the net. That put him above Austin in the Premier League scoring charts and left Rangers in the mire. Ferdinand had been recalled to the team after being omitted for the mid-week visit of Arsenal – and the home fans counselled the 36-year-old to take another, longer rest. “Rio Ferdinand, it’s time to retire,” they wailed.\n\n“When goals go in there are always going to be people who get the blame,” said QPR’s head coach, Chris Ramsey. “But for Rio to be at the age he is and playing at this level and applying himself in training and the games, I think we really need to just keep encouraging him to do what he’s doing.”\n\nRangers were drifting towards another defeat but in the 75th minute they started to rebel, as Sandro guided a fine sidefooted shot into the net from the edge of the box. Two minutes later Austin unleashed a shot that Nabil Bentaleb blocked, with his hands according to the home side. Again the referee waved away their claims.

Yet, for Manchester City, any win will do at the moment. This was only their fifth in a dozen matches since the turn of the year and it was unusual to see a team of their gifts make such hard work of it against a side propping up the rest of the Premier League.\n\nManuel Pellegrini’s side had to withstand some anxious moments before the substitute James Milner soothed any lingering nerves with his 88th-minute goal and it could conceivably have been a more chastening experience but for the fact this was another night for students of refereeing demonology to flick through their little black books.\n\nDavid Silva had opened the scoring in first-half stoppage time and Leicester’s goalkeeper, Mark Schwarzer, was kept busy enough to demonstrate why he is still playing at this level at the age of 42. Yet that tells only part of the story on a night when Vincent Kompany was demoted because of his deterioration in form, Wilfried Bony had an undistinguished first start for his new club and Leicester had justifiable complaints they had been on the wrong end of some crucial refereeing errors.\n\nNigel Pearson finished the night demanding video technology and the Leicester manager needed all his restraint not to talk himself into trouble because of the decisions from the referee, Robert Madley, that went against his team.\n\nPearson thought there were three different occasions when Leicester should have been awarded penalties and that, perhaps, was doing a disservice to Joe Hart after taking the ball a split second before connecting with Andrej Kramaric for the second of them.\n\nThe two incidents sandwiching that moment, though, were more obvious injustices. Pearson was certainly entitled to be aggrieved about Bony taking down Jeff Schlupp midway through the first half and there was another let-off for the home side five minutes after the interval when Fernando fouled Kramaric and the free-kick was awarded just outside the penalty area. The replays confirmed Kramaric had been marginally inside and Pearson was simmering with anger.\n\n“Fifa have decided, in their wisdom, to block it [video technology] and that probably says something about Fifa,” he said.\n\nLeicester will have to wonder whether the occasion might have panned out very differently had the correct decisions been made. This was certainly a good time potentially to face the champions, who were at least a couple of notches below their best and grateful, at 1-0, that Riyad Mahrez’s 74th-minute shot came back off the upright.\n\nKompany was watching from the back row of the dugout, hunched up in his overcoat, while Samir Nasri and Fernandinho did not even get on the bench and Pablo Zabaleta was also among the substitutes. Pellegrini will always defend his team but his selection here confirmed how alarmed he has been by their carelessness since the turn of the year. The home side’s shortcomings early on were epitomised when Paul Konchesky, Leicester’s nomadic left-back, slipped the ball through Jesús Navas’s legs for a perfectly executed nutmeg. The crowd was flat and, though Bony worked hard to enliven the occasion, his finishing was poor. The first half was meandering to its close before Silva spared his team-mates the possibility of heading to the tunnel amid a soundtrack of discontent.\n\nYaya Touré started the move with one of his driving runs through the centre. Silva knocked the ball out to Aleksandar Kolarov on the left and then continued his forward movement into the penalty area, anticipating where the cross would come. Bony went for it first but was under pressure from Robert Huth and when the ball squirted out to Silva, he scored at the second attempt after his first effort had come back off Wes Morgan.\n\nBony’s erratic finishing throughout the night could probably be put down to anxiety. Schwarzer saved one effort in the first half but another flew over the bar and Bony missed the target again when Silva picked him out in the penalty area early in the second half. Bony, to give him his due, looked keen to justify his selection but the £25m recruit from Swansea was replaced by Milner after 72 minutes and will not remember the occasion with great fondness.\n\nSergio Agüero was strangely subdued, too, and Navas’s cross for Milner’s goal only partially disguises the way he tends to flit in and out of matches. Eliaquim Mangala, taking over from Kompany alongside Martín Demichelis, had one of his better games. Yet it was strange to see the champions looking so dishevelled against such moderate opponents.\n\nTouré tried a curler that was heading for the top corner until Schwarzer turned it away and Silva, as always, tried to lift his team, always wanting the ball and having that rare knack just about every time of doing the right thing with it.\n\nMilner turned in Navas’s centre and the home side could relax but they will know there has to be an improvement if they are to stand any chance of making up the gap to Chelsea."}, {"date": "04/03/2015", "arena": "St James' Park, Newcastle", "attendance":

controversy on a night when Ashley Young’s late winner kept Manchester United’s hopes of Champions League qualification very much alive.\n\nUnfortunately the tone had been lowered by the altercation involving Newcastle United’s No9 and Manchester United’s centre-half. After both players tussled, mutually kicking out, television replays suggested Cissé was complaining Evans had spat in his eye but other images showing the United centre-half flinching indicated that this was far from one-sided.\n\nWhile the pictures of what precisely unfolded after Cissé looked to tread on Evans are not entirely conclusive, the Football Association will surely pore over them on Thursday before quite possibly using video evidence to impose lengthy retrospective bans stemming from an incident unseen by Anthony Taylor, the referee.\n\nThe two managers were similarly in the dark. “The first I heard of it was when the television people told me,” said John Carver, Newcastle’s head coach.\n\nLouis van Gaal appeared even more astonished. “I didn’t see from the bench, it’s too far,” said Manchester United’s manager. “But I cannot imagine that Jonny Evans could do that. He is a very modest person. It was not a discussion in the dressing room.”\n\nDespite ceding the majority of possession to Van Gaal’s clearly superior side, a defeat facilitated by Mehdi Abeid’s backpass was arguably a little harsh on a Newcastle team who might have had an early penalty before seeing Emmanuel Rivière and Cissé spurn fine counter-attacking chances.\n\n“Very disappointing” said Carver, who felt his players should have been awarded a throw-in during the preamble to Young’s goal. “Manchester United have world-class players but we’ve frustrated them for 89 minutes and been denied a clear-cut penalty.”\n\nGames can hinge on the sort of controversial decision made by Taylor in the 10th minute. After Rivière collected Gabriel Obertan’s pass and sashayed beyond Daley Blind he drew the United centre- half into a rash, clumsy challenge but, puzzlingly, Taylor detected no penalty.\n\nThat cameo apart United started strongly. If at times Van Gaal’s players let themselves down with careless concessions of possession, Carver knew his side had been reprieved when, back to goal, Wayne Rooney controlled the ball on his chest, swivelled and dinked a shot wide. With the advancing Krul beaten, Rooney knew he really should have scored and Carver certainly had cause to castigate a Newcastle defence caught square ahead of appealing, forlornly, for an offside that never was.\n\nNot that United’s footwork could always quite match the ambition of their vision. Significantly half-time beckoned when Tim Krul reacted smartly to divert a header from Marouane Fellaini following Antonio Valencia’s fine cross. It represented the first on target effort.\n\nAs if to compensate, the second period represented a marked improvement. When Fabricio Coloccini’s downward header fell kindly for Rivière in the area, he seemed certain to score his first Premier League goal but De Gea spread himself, extended a hand and somehow managed to divert it for a corner.\n\nNot to be outdone Krul swiftly, and incredibly, upstaged his Manchester United counterpart with a stunning double save which prevented first Fellaini and then Young scoring from close range.\n\nThe biggest cheer of the night came shortly afterwards. St James’ Park finally found its voice to welcome back Jonás Gutiérrez into a Newcastle side for the first time since his diagnosis with testicular cancer 17 months ago. Hugged by his friend Coloccini, Gutiérrez was handed the captain’s armband after replacing Ryan Taylor at left-back and promptly collected a booking for fouling Adnan Januzaj – on for a frustrated Angel Di Maria.\n\nWithin minutes Newcastle might have been ahead. Spotting Ander Herrera lingering in possession, Ayoze Pérez dispossessed him before playing in Cissé only for the Senegal striker to shoot horribly wide.\n\nKrul enjoyed a wonderful game until Abeid’s 100mph, six-yard back-pass in the wake of Rooney’s wonderful dribble left him thoroughly startled. Slicing the ball wildly he kicked straight to Young who shot into the unguarded net.\n\n“It was very important to win today,” said Van Gaal. “I’m very pleased with the performance. It’s a difficult ground to win at but we were dominant.”"}, {"date": "04/03/2015", "arena": "Kiyan Prince Foundation Stadium", "attendance": 17977, "home_team": {"name": "Queens Park Rangers", "lineup": [{"name": "Robert Green", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Darnell Furlong", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nedum Onuoha", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Steven Caulker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Suk-Young Yun", "yellows": [80], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matt Phillips", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Karl Henry", "yellows": [32], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sandro", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [56]}, {"name": "Junior Hoilett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [73]}, {"name": "Charlie Austin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [82], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bobby Zamora", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Clint Hill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shaun Wright-Phillips", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex McCarthy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mauricio Isla", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [73], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Niko Kranjcar", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [56], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eduardo Vargas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mauro Zárate", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Arsenal", "lineup": [{"name": "David Ospina", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Hector Bellerin", "yellows": [34], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Per Mertesacker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gabriel Paulista", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [37]}, {"name": "Kieran Gibbs", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tomas Rosicky", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [87]}, {"name": "Francis Coquelin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Santi Cazorla", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mesut Özil", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Olivier Giroud", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [64], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alexis Sánchez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [69], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Laurent Koscielny", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [37], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Theo Walcott", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Ramsey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [87], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Calum Chambers", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Welbeck", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Emiliano Martinez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "“It’s hot up there,” said Arsène Wenger as he surveyed the scene at the top end of the Premier League, with everyone winning their midweek outings. There is currently no margin for error and after an uninspired opening Arsenal duly pulled themselves together to collect another three points with unerring finishes from Olivier Giroud and Alexis Sánchez.\n\nIn a game littered with chances, the difference boiled down to finishing – and Arsenal were ruthless enough to secure the points needed to keep them ahead of the pack in the hunt for Champions League requalification.\n\nDown the bottom end of the table, QPR were left feeling the chill. Chris Ramsey appeared to be hurting as he rued manful efforts unrewarded. They put a huge amount of industry into a first half they dominated, both in terms of possession and chances. It came to nothing once Arsenal moved up a gear. Endeavour is not much consolation when you are in the basement, knocking on a trapdoor that is not easily opened back up. “I am sick for the players, sick we have not got anything out of the game,” Ramsey lamented.\n\nHigh tension and high stakes coursed through this meeting of top four chasers versus relegation facers and it was to QPR’s credit that they attacked their predicament – and Arsenal – head on. The gameplan, to harass and press their opponents, and shoot on sight whenever a sniff of an opportunity presented itself, gave them encouragement. The momentum kept building with every tackle from the steel in midfield, in the shape of Karl Henry and the returning Sandro, with every heartfelt run from Bobby Zamora, every thwacked shot unleashed by Charlie Austin.\n\nWenger admitted it made Arsenal nervous. David Ospina was worked on several occasions as QPR peppered his goal. Austin was at the heart of it all. He produces such power on his sudden efforts and shows such bloody-minded determination to send the ball hurtling goalwards.\n\nChastened, perhaps, by some words at half-time, Arsenal began with far more energy after the break, with the evergreen Tomas Rosicky pepping up his team almost single-handed. One dazzling run, and a firm volley saved by Rob Green, epitomised how Arsenal bucked up their ideas. Suddenly there was more zip and fluency, and more influence from the big guns.\n\nThe breakthrough came from a counterattack. Mesut Özil and Sánchez carried the move forwards and when Kieran Gibbs joined in from left-back his deflected effort was turned in by Giroud, in the right place to pop the ball past Green at the near post. The Frenchman, after playing so poorly against Monaco last week, has recovered to make the difference with the first goal in two successive league games.\n\nEmboldened, Arsenal searched for more. Sánchez twice had fine chances in quick succession and at the third attempt he drove into the box and deceived Green with another instinctive shot at the near post. The Chilean was elated to rediscover his taste for goals after a seven-game drought. It also put to bed the theory that Sánchez and Özil, Arsenal’s two most luxurious buys, do not particularly mix. It was a quirk of recent matches that Sanchez, so prolific in the first half of the season, had lost his eye for goal since the return of the languid assists man. “When you don’t score for seven or eight games it is on your mind, even if you say it isn’t,” said Wenger. “He never gives up.”\n\nIt was a galling setback for QPR and for Ramsey it illustrated how frustratingly games can tilt in favour of the elite. “Scoring goals is always the hardest thing and that is why the top teams are top,” he said. “When they are not playing well they come up with two goals. They would probably admit that was not one of their stellar performances. You end up in the situation we are in now because we are probably relying too much on Charlie’s efforts. There are not too many goals from other areas of the pitch. For all that effort, we have ended up with no points.”\n\nÖzil came close to adding to the scoreline, striking a post, and the next intervention infused QPR with unexpected hope as Austin finally found his range to swivel and shoot past Ospina but they could find no more.\n\nRamsey concluded it was “imperative” for QPR to pick up a win soon. He remains a realist: “When I embarked on this situation I didn’t think it would be a walk in the park.”"}, {"date": "04/03/2015", "arena": "Bet365 Stadium", "attendance": 26431, "home_team": {"name":

still 12 points short of that target and remain on the fringes of the relegation fight.\n\nStoke were worth their win, if only for the excellence of Moses’ first-half goal and general attacking play. The Chelsea loanee was one of the few players on the pitch willing to take on opponents and on several occasions he proved capable of beating them, too. Everton are going to have to fight harder than this if they are going to climb away from trouble. The visitors neither battled like a David Moyes team nor passed like a Roberto Martínez one, with the result that Stoke, who keep things relatively simple and know what they are good at, saw them off with surprisingly few alarms.\n\nAaron Lennon returned to the Everton starting lineup to face the team he rejected joining on loan in January and was booed from the outset, though for the most part he was as innocuous out wide as he proved to be in his latter seasons at Tottenham. Gareth Barry’s attempt to recover possession from Charlie Adam led to an early booking that will put him out for the next two matches, his 10th caution of the season triggering an automatic suspension.\n\nThere was little football to speak of at first. Everton hoofed more long balls in the direction of Romelu Lukaku than Stoke launched towards Peter Crouch, neither with any sign of success. Moses showed some neat touches for the home side but initially could not get into the game, while Everton had the most tenacious and hard-working midfielder in the splendidly consistent James McCarthy.\n\nIt took half an hour for the game to warm up, which it did when Tim Howard was called upon to make the first save of any note, punching clear when Moses escaped Séamus Coleman to send in a shot from the edge of the area.\n\nThat woke the crowd up, as did an altercation on Stoke’s right touchline soon afterwards, when McCarthy and Steven Naismith ganged up on Phil Bardsley. That led indirectly to the first goal, when Bardsley sent a cross over from the same wing that Moses met with a stunning header.\n\nWith the Everton defence all too aware of the aerial threat posed by Crouch, Moses rose almost unchallenged to guide a header past Howard from just beyond the penalty spot. It was a goal of some quality, though sadly the only thing meriting such a description in a disjointed first period. “Victor has always had a great leap,” the admiring Mark Hughes said. “It was a fantastic header, great power and placement.”\n\nEverton began the second half slightly more promisingly. Lukaku finally managed to find space for a shot that took a slight deflection and Arouna Koné came on to test Asmir Begovic almost immediately, though Everton goal attempts were sporadic. Hughes kept making attacking substitutions and eventually they paid off for the Stoke manager.\n\nCity were simply defending in the closing stages, with even Moses getting back to help, before they found the energy to make a decisive breakaway six minutes from time. Mame Biram Diouf ran clear from the centre circle with Phil Jagielka in his wake, found Marko Arnautovic overlapping on his right, and when his fellow substitute’s shot came back off the far post Diouf was still onside for a simple tap-in.\n\nEverton could have few complaints. Not only have they won only one league game in 12, of the 14 points that now separate these clubs Martínez’s side have donated six to the Stoke survival fund. There were boos from the travelling support at the end. “We didn’t have enough of a cutting edge,” Martínez admitted. “But at least we get a proper rest now. We have just played five games in two weeks and it showed, but we still have 10 games to play and six of them are at Goodison.” That is 10 league games, of course.\n\nEverton’s continued commitment to the Europa League, something Martínez would normally never question, is currently the elephant in the room."}, {"date": "04/03/2015", "arena": "White Hart Lane", "attendance": 34008, "home_team":

minute here, the sense of dread was tangible. Three years on from Fabrice Muamba, it seemed as though it was all happening again. For five minutes, the doctors worked on another fit, young but stricken professional footballer.\n\nMercifully, it was not the same as the infamous Muamba incident, when the then Bolton Wanderers player dropped down and suffered a cardiac arrest but cheated death. After what seemed like an age, Gomis could be seen with his eyes open and moving his head. He was taken off on a stretcher and, at half-time, the word came through that he was “fine”. It seemed like an odd description, and it was one that the manager, Garry Monk, repeated afterwards but the relief was palpable.\n\nThe Gomis drama overshadowed what was an exciting game. Tottenham were seeking to bounce back from Sunday’s Capital One Cup final defeat to Chelsea and they did so, Ryan Mason scoring in the second-half and Andros Townsend adding what proved to be the winning goal.\n\nSwansea have never won at this venue in the league but they almost salvaged a last-gasp point. After Gylfi Sigurdsson had scored to set the nerves jangling for Tottenham, the home team were indebted to Hugo Lloris for an injury-time save from Federico Fernández. The goalkeeper flung himself to claw the Argentinian’s header to safety and make his latest telling contribution to his club’s season.\n\nThe atmosphere had been subdued at kick-off time – a legacy of Tottenham’s cup final defeat – but the mood dropped sharply when, immediately after Nacer Chadli’s early goal, there was the sight of Gomis lying motionless in the centre circle.\n\nWhen paramedics and doctors from both sides sprinted to the scene, it was impossible not to feel extremely worried. There was the eerie echo of Muamba’s collapse at this stadium in March 2012 and, as Gomis underwent lengthy treatment, everybody was thinking of the former Bolton player.\n\nThere was concern on the faces of the players but television pictures then showed Gomis looking responsive. As he was taken from the field, with an oxygen mask over his nose and mouth, there was applause from all sides. It was difficult to focus on the football. It seemed like an afterthought – even with so much riding on the game. All anybody wanted from the evening was a positive medical bulletin on Gomis and there was relief when it came.\n\nChadli’s goal had been lovely. He jumped to meet Danny Rose’s driven cross from the left before steering a cushioned volley into the corner of the net. But Swansea hit back on 19 minutes and the concession was dreadful from a Tottenham point of view and, in particular, that of Jan Vertonghen.\n\nSigurdsson, a former Spur, whipped a free-kick against Lloris’ post and the panic seemed to have passed for the home team. Not for long. Swansea worked the ball back towards the six-yard box, Vertonghen hesitated and he failed to clear. Suddenly, there was Ki Sung-Yeung, tip-toeing in, to squeeze a low shot past Lloris from a tight angle.\n\nThe collective prayers of everybody seemed to have been answered during the interval, when Swansea briefed that Gomis was stable. The shadow had not been entirely removed but the second-half seemed more enjoyable.\n\nJonjo Shelvey extended Lloris and Harry Kane was inches wide with a header before Mason sculpted his memorable moment. Christian Eriksen drove into the area and when Ashley Williams challenged, Mason arrived to take the ball in his stride and finish with a thumping shot high into the net.\n\nTownsend also finished smartly, after bombing almost the length of the field and cutting inside, while Sigurdsson’s goal was thumped home from the substitute Jefferson Montero’s cross. Swansea pushed and Fernández thought that he had fashioned the equaliser.

Chelsea players, as relieved as they were elated, converged in small groups in front of those massed in the lower tier of the Sir Trevor Brooking stand with the clenched fists and bellowed celebrations betraying the significance of success. Claiming the Capital One Cup at Wembley, and with it the first major silverware of José Mourinho’s second coming, is one thing. Emerging victorious from a derby as brutal as this to retain authority in the title race arguably meant so much more. The manager was probably only half joking when he admitted he might lie in until midday to recover.\n\nThis was blisteringly frenetic, the visitors stretched horribly at times by a West Ham United side who had won only once in 10 matches and were apparently witnessing their own promising campaign dying a death. At times the leaders heaved to contain the Hammers, with Sam Allardyce’s team direct and relentless, pouring forward with Diafra Sakho spurning at least four clear opportunities and Thibaut Courtois, restored after Sunday, maintaining his finest clean sheet yet as a Chelsea player.\n\nThat Chelsea’s only goal was perilously close to being ruled out for offside, with West Ham also left to bemoan the non-award of a penalty for handball against Gary Cahill, merely reinforced the sense that this was a decisive moment in the title race. Chelsea remain five points clear with a game in hand against the club who currently prop up the division. Theirs remains a position of strength.\n\nIt was certainly the kind of nail-biting win with which titles are claimed. West Ham had posed a different kind of threat to Tottenham Hotspur at the national stadium, with this team laced with pace and eager running when spurred on in a hostile atmosphere, and Enner Valencia and Sakho a constant menace.\n\nThe absence of the suspended Nemanja Matic was keenly felt throughout by the visitors, even if Mourinho subsequently revealed that his Serbian midfield shield had managed to twist an ankle while celebrating Sunday’s success out on the pitch and would not have been available to feature here even without his ban. “He had shinpads on but he didn’t have tape on,” said the manager of Matic, who had joined his team-mates on the pitch at Wembley post-match. He could deliver that anecdote through a smile given the injury is minor, but also because his available lineup had triumphed regardless.\n\nPsychologically, it would have been damaging had the slender lead secured by Eden Hazard’s goal midway through the opening period been surrendered amid West Ham’s avalanche of second-half chances. Courtois had risen to the occasion superbly, clawing away from the grounded Sakho’s prod, then diving sharply to his left to deflect the striker’s effort behind. His saves in the first half had been just as eye-catching, the Senegalese forward nodding Carl Jenkinson’s right-wing cross firmly down for Courtois to push away, while Cheikhou Kouyaté’s close-range attempt was blocked with his shins.\n\nWhen the Belgian did spill Valencia’s attempt, Cahill dived in to suffocate Sakho’s follow-up. The visitors were stretched, the threat charging at them from all angles with John Terry booked early and less at ease against slippery opponents whose energy levels never dipped. Allardyce bemoaned rare profligacy. “The way they play, nobody is better than them,” said Mourinho. “We faced some periods where we had to defend with everything.”\n\nTheir own threat was mustered on the counterattack, with their approach as ruthless as West Ham had been relentless. Kevin Nolan was still wondering how he had failed to make contact with Jenkinson’s centre when Chelsea broke at pace, Cesc Fàbregas exchanging passes with Hazard on the edge of the West Ham penalty area before slipping the overlapping Ramires free.\n\nThe home side were still adjusting to the hamstrung Winston Reid’s early departure, with the Brazilian’s centre whipped across the six-yard box and met emphatically by Hazard, who planted his header beyond Adrián. The playmaker appeared to have been marginally the wrong side of Aaron Cresswell and Jenkinson, the deepest of West Ham’s ramshackle back-line, but the assistant’s flag was not raised. Mourinho may consider good fortune had been with his team on this occasion.\n\nThey should have prospered further on the counter, Jenkinson conjuring one wondrous last-ditch tackle to thwart Diego Costa as he prepared to bury a second and Ramires, twice found by the brilliant Hazard, striking post and the goalkeeper’s outstretched foot. Cresswell somehow cleared Willian’s attempt from the line in stoppage time, but those missed opportunities merely added to the drama, both managers reduced to gibbering wrecks in their technical areas by the frantic majesty of the contest.\n\n“It would have been easy to have lost two points here,” added Mourinho. “We were on edge to the end because we couldn’t kill the game off, but in the end it was a massive win for us.” The title remains theirs to lose. Come May, they might just reflect on that win down the District Line as the moment the championship had started to feel properly within their grasp."}, {"date": "04/03/2015", "arena": "Anfield", "attendance": 44717, "home_team": {"name": "Liverpool", "lineup": [{"name": "Simon Mignolet", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Emre Can", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Skrtel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dejan Lovren", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Raheem Sterling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Jordan Henderson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [29], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Allen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alberto Moreno", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [73]}, {"name": "Adam Lallana", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daniel Sturridge", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [51], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [83]}, {"name": "Philippe Coutinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Glen Johnson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [83], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kolo Touré", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [73], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rickie Lambert", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mario Balotelli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordan Williams", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lazar Markovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Ward", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Burnley", "lineup": [{"name": "Tom Heaton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kieran Trippier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Keane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jason Shackell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Mee", "yellows": [85], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "George Boyd", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Jones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Scott Arfield", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Kightly", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [52]}, {"name": "Ashley Barnes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [66]}, {"name": "Danny Ings", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}], "subs": [{"name": "Michael Duff", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ross Wallace", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [52], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sam Vokes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [66], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Reid", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lukas Jutkiewicz", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matthew Gilks", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stephen Ward", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Brendan Rodgers denies it is a foregone conclusion that Jordan Henderson will be promoted from vice- to club captain when Steven Gerrard heads for Los Angeles this summer. Liverpool’s deputy, however, is compiling a strong case while the Anfield judge considers his options.\n\nHenderson followed his sublime opener against Manchester City on Sunday with another fine 20-yard goal to puncture a determined display by Burnley at Anfield. Not even Philippe Coutinho could eclipse the midfielder on this occasion and the 25-year-old embellished his night’s work by creating the second goal for Daniel Sturridge. Scored one, made one; and Liverpool required a captain’s performance from Henderson, with Sean Dyche’s men proving predictably obstinate opponents. Burnley have the character to fight for Premier League survival. Liverpool have the class and confidence of Champions League place contenders.\n\n“Jordan is improving all the time,” said Rodgers, who argued Liverpool’s display was on a par with the win against City in terms of defensive organisation and professionalism. “As he matures he will be even better tactically. It was a terrific strike for the goal and he showed great technique and precision for the second. He is becoming one of the real leaders of this team.”\n\nWhether that is enough to succeed Gerrard as captain remains to be seen and the impasse over a new contract for Henderson, who enters the final 12 months of his current deal this summer, does not help his cause. Maybe that explains Rodgers’ reticence over Liverpool’s next captain. Beyond doubt is the momentum behind Liverpool’s push for the top four, with 29 points now taken from the last 33 available after breaking down Burnley’s resistance.\n\nThe recalled Sturridge tested Tom Heaton in the Burnley goal after 25 seconds and while that marked the start of a high-tempo contest it was not the signal for Liverpool to dominate against relegation-threatened visitors. Dyche’s side made life difficult until Henderson’s opener in the 29th minute by employing the same high-pressing tactics that Rodgers used to telling effect against the Premier League champions. The number of chances they created regardless was a measure of Liverpool’s quality.\n\nHenderson headed over from a Coutinho corner and forced Heaton into another decent save low to his left from the edge of the area. Michael Keane almost gifted Sturridge an opener with a weak header from Emre Can’s deflected shot but Heaton gathered just in time. The keeper was given no chance when Liverpool’s captain for the night reprised his breakthrough act from the City game.\n\nCoutinho was under close scrutiny all night but managed to cut inside from the left and evade two Burnley players before his shot was blocked by a third. The rebound bounced towards Henderson on the edge of the area and, having adjusted his body shape to get behind the ball, the midfielder sent an unstoppable half-volley swerving away from Heaton’s grasp and into the Kop goal.\n\nJoe Allen and Coutinho went close to doubling Liverpool’s lead from distance and Sturridge had the best opportunity for a second when played clear by a deft pass from the Brazilian midfielder. His low, left-foot effort was well saved by the Burnley keeper. His opposite number, Simon Mignolet, was tested only once before the interval and dealt comfortably with Ashley Barnes’ header from Kieran Trippier’s free-kick.\n\nThe threat level from Burnley did increase but, unfortunately for Dyche, only after Sturridge had extended Liverpool’s advantage. This time Henderson turned creator, finding space in central midfield to float an inch-perfect cross over the visitors’ defence. Sturridge read the midfielder’s intentions expertly and peeled away from his marker to steer a fine header inside Heaton’s right-hand post. It was the England international’s 10th goal in his last 11 Premier League starts at Anfield and the 17th headed goal that Burnley have conceded this season, the most in the top flight.\n\n“They are an expensively assembled side with top-class players who have found their form and belief,” said Dyche. “That was a different side to what we faced on Boxing Day. It is possibly too late for this season but if they carry on like that they will be up there next season.”"}, {"date": "03/03/2015", "arena": "Villa Park", "attendance": 31272, "home_team": {"name": "Aston Villa", "lineup": [{"name": "Brad Guzan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alan Hutton", "yellows": [88], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jores Okore", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ciaran Clark", "yellows": [81], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matthew Lowton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Westwood", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Cleverley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [77]}, {"name": "Fabian Delph", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charles N'Zogbia", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [59]}, {"name": "Gabriel Agbonlahor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [22], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [82]}, {"name": "Christian Benteke", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [90], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Leandro Bacuna", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [77], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Scott Sinclair", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andreas Weimann", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [82], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Carlos Sánchez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Carles Gil", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shay Given", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Grealish", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [59], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "West Bromwich Albion", "lineup": [{"name": "Ben Foster", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Craig Dawson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gareth McAuley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joleon Lescott", "yellows": [52], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Brunt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Darren Fletcher", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Claudio Yacob", "yellows": [42], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Morrison", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Saido Berahino", "yellows": [88], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [66], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Craig Gardner", "yellows": [86], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Brown Ideye", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Andre Wisdom", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonas Olsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Baird", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Boaz Myhill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sébastien Pocognoli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Youssouf Mulumbu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stéphane Sessegnon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Tim Sherwood clenched his fists, looked to the heavens and started to dance around on the pitch in celebration. It was the last of three minutes of injury time and Christian Benteke, the coolest man in the stadium, had just nonchalantly rolled in the goal that breathes fresh life into Aston Villa’s season.\n\nIt was a night of high drama at Villa Park and nobody enjoyed the closing seconds more than Sherwood. He walked off the pitch with a couple of fingers on his neck, pretending to check his pulse in a gesture that he later explained was aimed at those who have already condemned Villa to the Championship. “We’re alive and kicking,” Sherwood said.\n\nIn the context of what has gone before, it was easy to forgive Sherwood for getting swept along with the euphoria that greeted the final whistle. Villa, after all, had come into this game on the back of a dismal run of 12 league games without a win, seven successive defeats and scored only 13 goals all season.\n\nA win over their local rivals was the shot in the arm they so badly needed and lifts Villa out of the Premier League relegation zone in the process.\n\nAs well as Sherwood’s side played at times, especially in the first half when the outstanding Gabriel Agbonlahor put them in front and gave Joleon Lescott a torrid time, good fortune was also smiling on them.\n\nWhile Ben Foster endured an evening to forget and was guilty of giving away the penalty that Benteke converted, Alan Hutton could count himself extremely fortunate to escape with only a booking for a malicious challenge on Saido Berahino.\n\nJonathan Moss, the referee, will need no telling when he reviews the incident that a red card should have been brandished after Hutton, competing for the ball on the touchline, thrust his studs into Berahino’s groin. It was not just the initial contact but the fact that Hutton then put more pressure on his boot.\n\nTo rub salt into Albion wounds, the Villa right-back went on to have a hand in the winning goal when he delivered the cross that led to Foster getting in a terrible tangle. Failing to cleanly gather the ball, after receiving an accidental nudge in the back from Chris Baird, the Albion substitute, Foster tried to retrieve the situation but succeeded only in bringing down Matthew Lowton.\n\nIt was that sort of game for the England international who also made a dreadful error in the first half when he allowed Agbonlahor’s low left-footed shot to slip between his legs.\n\nIn a state of panic, Foster quickly turned around and stretched out his right arm to drag the ball back, with goalline technology confirming that the whole of the ball had not crossed the line.\n\nAlbion and Foster were not so fortunate eight minutes later. Brad Guzan’s punt upfield was no more than hopeful but Benteke climbed above Chris Brunt to flick the ball on. Gambling on his strike partner winning the header, Agbonlahor sprinted in behind Lescott and drilled a low shot under Foster. Not a man to conceal his emotions Sherwood sprinted 45 yards down the touchline, pumping his arms like crazy.\n\nThe only disappointment for Villa come the interval was that they had only one goal to show for their dominance. Agbonlahor, playing like a man possessed, ran on to another ball over the top, this time from Ashley Westwood, and slipped his shot past Foster only for Lescott to get back and clear. Then, on the stroke of half-time, Fabian Delph curled a right-footed effort from the edge of the area that struck the foot of the far upright.\n\nIt was strange to see Albion look so disjointed in that opening period but the complexion of the game changed after the interval. Craig Dawson headed narrowly over the bar from a Brunt free-kick not long before another set piece produced the equaliser.\n\nThis time it was a Brunt corner that Lescott headed back across goal for the unmarked Berahino to nod home his 18th goal of the season.\n\nAt that point it was easy to question how a Villa side with such brittle confidence would react but Sherwood kept urging them to pass the ball and their reward came in that extraordinary finale.\n\nNow both teams have to do it all over again in the FA Cup quarter-final at Villa Park on Saturday evening. “West Brom will have to improve to stop us getting to Wembley,” Sherwood said."}, {"date": "03/03/2015", "arena": "KCOM Stadium", "attendance": 23017, "home_team": {"name": "Hull City", "lineup": [{"name": "Allan McGregor",

relegation rivals, Hull City.\n\nPoyet was sent to the stands by the referee Mike Dean following his reaction to Jack Rodwell’s 36th-minute booking for diving – a thunderous right-footed kick at a cooler, dispensing two dozen water bottles across the turf in front of the technical areas. Rather than take his medicine quietly, however, the Uruguayan ventured to his opposite number, Steve Bruce, to spark a touchline flashpoint.\n\nHe then offered his hand in a sarcastic manner, something Poyet said clearly incensed Bruce, who was only prevented from accosting his adversary by the quick-thinking of the assistant referee Stuart Burt. Neither manager would reveal the words that were exchanged afterwards, with Poyet insisting: “What happened on the pitch, stays on the pitch. It’s football, passion. Kicking bottles of water is nothing serious.”\n\nThe handshake did take place in the corridors of the KC Stadium and Bruce’s peace offering was a glass of red wine. “We will both regret it in the morning so let’s just get on with our lives,” he said. “I owe the linesman a beer because I am a big heavyweight and he was a bit of a lightweight, so he will have been exhausted trying to keep hold of me.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sunderland’s Gus Poyet and Hull City’s Steve Bruce reflect on confrontation.\n\nPoyet’s loss of temper came at the end of a chastening 36 hours for Sunderland, with Adam Johnson, the midfielder who opened the scoring in the reverse fixture, suspended by the club on Monday in the wake of his arrest on suspicion of sexual activity with a girl under 16.\n\nThe absence of the 27-year-old winger capped a dozen times by England denied Sunderland width. It also denied a team that do not find the net with any regularity their top scorer; one of his four goals came in the reverse fixture on Boxing Day, the start of a sequence of only one win in 11 league matches.\n\nHull’s own woes in attack had persuaded Bruce to sign the Senegal striker Dame N’Doye on January’s deadline day and the £2.2m acquisition from Lokomotiv Moscow struck for a third time in as many starts to put Hull on course for three consecutive home wins for the first time in the Premier League.\n\nThe opportunity arose when Wes Brown’s lunge felled Ahmed Elmohamady on the edge of the area. Tom Huddlestone stepped up, fired the free-kick low into a crowded penalty area and the quick-thinking N’Doye improvised with a flick of a heel to divert the ball past Costel Pantilimon from eight yards.\n\nN’Doye’s goal was evidence of Hull’s superiority in a fixture historically mired in petulance. Last season Sunderland had two players dismissed in a single-goal defeat and Poyet’s own indiscipline spread through his side this time – they will receive a mandatory £25,000 fine for six bookings.\n\nIn truth, they were fortunate not to see a similar reduction in numbers to last season: there was certainly an argument for Liam Bridcutt walking when he went over the top of the ball in a tackle on Nikica Jelavic less than 60 seconds into the second half, and Lee Cattermole – one of the duo dismissed here 16 months ago – did leave early, at Poyet’s intervention, when he was hauled off just after the hour, moments after being cautioned for a petulant tripping of David Meyler.\n\nHull continued to dominate in terms of chances created, with N’Doye lacking his usual composure twice when well-placed and the slender nature of their advantage was exposed 13 minutes from time when the substitute Patrick van Aanholt skipped to the by-line to wedge a cross over the goalkeeper Allan McGregor to the back post. Rodwell converted with a scruffy header, the ball rolling down his arm – much to Hull’s chagrin – but almost certainly only after it had crossed the line."}, {"date": "03/03/2015", "arena": " Mary's Stadium", "attendance": 28351, "home_team": {"name": "Southampton", "lineup": [{"name": "Fraser Forster", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathaniel Clyne", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "José Fonte", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Maya Yoshida", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Bertrand", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Wanyama", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Morgan Schneiderlin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eljero Elia", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [60]}, {"name": "Filip Djuricic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [78]}, {"name": "Sadio Mané", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [83], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Graziano Pellè", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [70]}], "subs": [{"name": "Kelvin Davis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Florin Gardos", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shane Long", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [70], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Davis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dusan Tadic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [60], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Ward-Prowse", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [78], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Toby Alderweireld", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Crystal Palace", "lineup": [{"name": "Julian Speroni", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joel Ward", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Scott Dann", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Damien Delaney", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Kelly", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wilfried Zaha", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Ledley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James McArthur", "yellows": [30], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [84]}, {"name": "Yannick Bolasie", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jason Puncheon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dwight Gayle", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Adrian Mariappa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Brede Hangeland", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wayne Hennessey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shola Ameobi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [84], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Hiram Boateng", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jake Gray", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pape Souaré", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "This was just the tonic Southampton needed to halt a steady decline. With 10 minutes remaining their malaise of late looked set to continue but Sadio Mané’s determination and deft touch secured a first win at home since New Year’s Day for Ronald Koeman’s side, whose top-four ambitions appear renewed.\n\nCrystal Palace had won five successive away matches under Alan Pardew before this defeat and will count themselves unlucky to not have at least earned a point. Wilfried Zaha hit a post and Fraser Forster was twice called on during a second half that could have easily have swung their way, with unease beginning to creep in at St Mary’s as Southampton struggled to create any telling opportunities.\n\nSaints had not scored at home in the league for 387 minutes before Mané’s strike, a fine run and calm finish to end a game that had been drifting away. Ultimately, however, Koeman will care little about the manner of this win, providing as it did three crucial points to keep them in touch with the Premier League’s top four before a squad break in Switzerland.\n\n“Finally we scored and we win at home,” said Koeman. “I can’t say that we deserved the win today. Maybe after the first half yes, but after the second half Crystal Palace did well. Some good chances, a shot on the post. Football is strange. It’s all about the confidence.\n\n“I think it can be very important. This win maybe is one of the key moments of the season. We like to fight for a high position in the table but if you don’t win [for] three games in a row at home. It’s not important how you score, if you score. We have to be a little bit more ruthless in the box.”\n\nThat is a lesson that Southampton’s players must heed if they are going to remain a threat to the establishment at the summit of the league. In large spells here they dominated in possession terms, but for all their control of the ball they were blighted by insipid attacking play.\n\nJulián Speroni had only one save to make during a forgettable first half. It has become a pattern of Saints’ play in recent weeks, with Graziano Pellè out of form and the goals in short supply; a lack of composure and a growing frustration has crept in at St Mary’s.\n\nSperoni was called into action five minutes before half-time. A Southampton corner was whipped into the six-yard box but Yannick Bolasie’s headed clearance only found Eljero Elia, whose smart shot on the turn was palmed away by Speroni. Pellè pounced on the rebound but prodded wide.\n\nThings swiftly turned after half-time as Palace grew into the game. Bolasie, Jason Puncheon and Wilfried Zaha were suddenly combining potently in attack, as Southampton’s defence suffered.\n\nPuncheon was first to test Fraser Forster in the 48th minute. Bolasie jinked inside from the left and slipped the ball inside where Puncheon appeared tightly marked. However, in the blink of an eye the in-form midfielder made room for a shot and fizzed an effort straight at Forster.\n\nThe goalkeeper was soon called on again. This time it was Bolasie with the shot, fed into the area by Zaha down the right and attempting a low effort across goal. Forster was equal to it once more, but Southampton failed to clear and the ball fell to Zaha who was denied by the post.\n\nIt was Mané, though, who struck the decisive late blow. The Senegalese midfielder was the driving force behind a move that started from nothing on the right flank. However, Mané found the substitute James Ward-Prowse and space opened up for a shot. He fired in a low shot that Speroni could only parry into the path of Mané, who dinked the loose ball deftly over the goalkeeper and in.\n\nPardew thought the referee Martin Atkinson – officiating his first game since the controversial Nemanja Matic red card against Burnley – should have awarded Palace a penalty in the 70th minute after José Fonte collided with Bolasie, but admitted his side missed a physical threat in attack.\n\n“It was obviously a big game for them in terms of the Champions League,” said Pardew. “But they played very well in the first half and we missed a physical presence at the top of the pitch. In the second half we were much better. Southampton were running out of ideas and we should have scored. I think we should have had a penalty as well.”"}, {"date": "01/03/2015", "arena": "Anfield", "attendance": 44590, "home_team": {"name": "Liverpool", "lineup": [{"name": "Simon Mignolet", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Emre Can", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Skrtel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dejan Lovren", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lazar Markovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [76]}, {"name": "Jordan Henderson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [11], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Allen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alberto Moreno", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [83]}, {"name": "Adam Lallana", "yellows": [84], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Raheem Sterling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Philippe Coutinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [75], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Kolo Touré", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [83], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rickie Lambert", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daniel Sturridge", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [76], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fabio Borini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mario Balotelli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordan Williams", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Ward", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Manchester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Joe Hart", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pablo Zabaleta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Vincent Kompany", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eliaquim Mangala", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aleksandar Kolarov", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Samir Nasri", "yellows": [57], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [83]}, {"name": "Yaya Touré", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fernandinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [78]}, {"name": "David Silva", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sergio Agüero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Edin Dzeko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [25], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [58]}], "subs": [{"name": "Fernando", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Milner", "yellows": [82], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [58], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willy Caballero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wilfried Bony", "yellows": [86], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [78], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Frank Lampard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [83], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gael Clichy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martín Demichelis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "The only fatigue in evidence at Anfield lay in Manchester City’s defence of the Premier League title. Liverpool were supposed to be travel-weary following Europa League exertions in Istanbul yet were revitalised by Brazilian brilliance from Philippe Coutinho. Brendan Rodgers’ “young magician” may have conjured a Champions League ticket and the end of a title contest at a stroke.\n\nCoutinho created one stunning goal for Jordan Henderson and scored another of his own to condemn Manuel Pellegrini’s champions to a second damaging 2-1 defeat in six days. City, for all their title-winning expertise and the incentive of closing the gap on Chelsea to two points, could not match the vibrancy or potency of the 22-year-old from Rio de Janeiro or the intensity of Liverpool’s overall performance.\n\nSergio Agüero and David Silva offered hope in flashes for the visitors but, with the exception of their stellar talents, City were fresh out of ideas.\n\nThe recent failure to sign players with the pedigree of Silva, Agüero and Yaya Touré, anonymous here until a late surging run into the Liverpool area, combined with Vincent Kompany’s regression in the heart of defence has added to Pellegrini’s problems in attempting to keep pace with Chelsea.\n\nLiverpool extended City’s wait for a first win at Anfield since 2003 with a result that will change their own perceptions of what is achievable in the league this season.\n\nRodgers did all he could to minimise the impact of Thursday’s 120-minute outing against Besiktas and his decision to rest the mesmerising Coutinho in Turkey paid dividends. The opening suggested his concerns at Friday’s 4.19am return had substance as City controlled possession but they imploded during an error-strewn five-minute spell that energised Liverpool and a previously flat atmosphere.\n\nCentral to the shift were Coutinho and Kompany. The first chance of the game set a template for much that followed as Coutinho played Adam Lallana into a gaping hole in the City defence created by Kompany’s and Eliaquim Mangala’s decision to track Raheem Sterling. Lallana shot tamely at Joe Hart, and also had two goals disallowed for offside, but more City mistakes ensured the reprieve was short-lived.\n\nFernandinho, who replaced Fernando following the Brazilian’s ineffectual performance against Barcelona, sold his captain short with a careless pass on the halfway line. Kompany lost out in the challenge to the slight Coutinho who broke with speed and found Sterling. The 20-year-old squared to Henderson and Liverpool’s captain for the day cut in from the left to send an outstanding finish into the top corner from 20 yards. It was an exquisite breakthrough from a midfielder determined to take responsibility in the absence of the injured Steven Gerrard, but also a worrying sign for Pellegrini in terms of his own captain’s contribution.\n\nKompany had struggled in the Champions League on Tuesday and City’s centre defence was vulnerable again at Anfield. The Belgian has resorted to the creaking centre-half’s refuge of instinctively blocking a striker’s run by any means necessary, as he no longer backs his powers of recovery, yet Kompany was immune to a yellow card from the referee, Mark Clattenburg. Wilfried Bony also benefited from the referee’s leniency when he caught Lallana in the face with a raised arm but the substitute was only booked.\n\nCity almost levelled immediately when Agüero latched onto Silva’s ball over the top and sent a first time shot beyond Simon Mignolet but also against the foot of a post. The visitors gradually rediscovered their composure on the ball, in the final third at least, and demonstrated their ability to grind down opponents with fine team goal.\n\nThe equaliser originated from a loose pass by Coutinho of all people. Pablo Zabaleta intercepted a pass intended for Sterling, Touré picked out Silva, the Spaniard released Agüero into space in front of Liverpool’s back three and the striker picked out Edin Dzeko’s run in behind. Dzeko duly despatched a measured finish into Mignolet’s bottom corner.\n\nDespite regaining a measure of control City’s defence repeatedly struggled against Liverpool’s fast-moving forward line and it was the home side who continued to create the clearer openings. Lallana swept a half-volley wide of the far post from Lazar Markovic’s chip into the box, Kompany blocked a Sterling shot and the winger scuffed an excellent chance wide from Lallana’s inviting cross shortly after the restart.\n\nThe second half developed into a scrappy, even affair in desperate need of a moment of class to lift it beyond the ordinary. Coutinho was the man to oblige. There were 15 minutes remaining when Sterling spun away from his marker and found Liverpool’s No10 lurking with intent to the left of the City area. Coutinho stepped inside Samir Nasri and, without needing to glance up, curled a superb shot over Hart’s despairing dive into the far corner. A goal worthy of winning any game and, quite possibly, flooring a title challenge in the process.\n\nMan of the match Philippe Coutinho (Liverpool)"}, {"date": "01/03/2015", "arena": "Emirates Stadium", "attendance": 59925, "home_team": {"name": "Arsenal", "lineup": [{"name": "David Ospina", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Hector Bellerin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gabriel Paulista", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Laurent Koscielny", "yellows": [78], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kieran Gibbs", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Santi Cazorla", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Francis Coquelin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [89]}, {"name": "Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [82]}, {"name": "Mesut Özil", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alexis Sánchez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [87]}, {"name": "Olivier Giroud", "yellows": [46], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [39], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Wojciech Szczesny", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Per Mertesacker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tomas Rosicky", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [89], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [82], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Theo Walcott", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nacho Monreal", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Calum Chambers", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [89], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Welbeck", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [87], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Everton", "lineup": [{"name": "Tim Howard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Seamus Coleman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Stones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Jagielka", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Luke Garbutt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James McCarthy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gareth Barry", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [84]}, {"name": "Muhamed Besic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [77]}, {"name": "Kevin Mirallas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [62]}, {"name": "Romelu Lukaku", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ross Barkley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Joel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Darron Gibson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [84], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Arouna Kone", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Naismith", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [77], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leon Osman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Lennon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [62], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Antolin Alcaraz", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "After the storm, the calm. An unspectacular yet entirely satisfactory three points enabled Arsenal to breathe easily again at the end of a turbulent week. There was no collective bloody nose this time, just the broken one suffered by Francis Coquelin when Olivier Giroud clattered into him. The sense of Arsenal as a team being desperate to react to adversity was summed up by Coquelin staying on to do his blocking and harrying job with a smashed-up face. “I am very proud of the response we showed,” Arsène Wenger said.\n\nAlthough Everton engineered a few close shaves, decisive moments by the players at both of Arsenal’s sharp ends made the difference. Giroud, who had endured the kind of striker’s nightmare that forced Wenger to remove him from the spotlight during the Champions League defeat in midweek, showed the character to climb straight back on to the horse. His persistence was rewarded with the opener. In goal David Ospina needed a mix of determination and improvisation to maintain the welcome platform of a clean sheet.\n\nThe need to address both goalmouths was obvious after the European lesson handed out by Monaco. It was unhelpful, therefore, for the first big moment of the game to bring to mind Wenger’s lament about “suicidal defending”.\n\nThe game hinged on a period midway through the first half during which Gabriel Paulista, the centre-back newly arrived from La Liga, was confronted with the full power of Romelu Lukaku. In the first instance the defender dithered, let the ball bounce and Arsenal hearts jumped into mouths awaiting another calamity as Ospina rushed out to meet Lukaku. The keeper was brave to paw at the ball and then slide tackle to avert disaster twice. “That could have been a completely different story … ” Roberto Martínez said.\n\nThe next time Lukaku bore dangerously into the penalty area Gabriel showed impeccable defensive instincts to pluck the ball from him. The energy around the place changed as the home crowd were visibly lifted by the saving tackle.\n\nOver to Giroud. After his serial profligacy against Monaco he missed his first chance, steering wide Alexis Sánchez’s pinpoint cross. Wenger believes wholeheartedly in the striker’s capacity to keep going. Redemption arrived – and how Giroud enjoyed it with a celebratory flourish as he pointed to the heavens – when he shrugged off John Stones to steer in Arsenal’s opening goal from a corner.\n\n“Arsène Wenger gave me the possibility to bounce back. We wanted to do that together,” Giroud said.\n\nWenger was delighted: “Olivier has one great quality. When his back is to the wall he has the personality to respond. Because I know him better now that is one of the reasons why I kept him in the team. He acknowledged he missed his game and I knew he had the strength to respond.”\n\nEverton were far more threatening in the second half, immediately challenging Arsenal with a string of set pieces. Ospina needed to be alert to repel Lukaku and the substitute Aaron Lennon. Then Gabriel arrived with another strong tackle to block off the arriving Ross Barkley.\n\nEverton’s frustration is that they could not make those chances count. The result was confirmed in the penultimate minute. Phil Jagielka, who had intervened twice at key moments to fall on to a Giroud effort and then deflect a Mesut Özil shot, was in the way when Tomas Rosicky let fly. The ball ricocheted off the Everton captain and into the net. The goal marked the second assist of the day for Özil.\n\n“You read the 2-0 scoreline but it doesn’t reflect the game and that’s the story of our season,” Martínez said. “We have had to be perfect to win games and that is something we have to change in the next 11 games. We are in the final third of season, everyone fighting for same thing - to get 40 points – then to get the next aim.”\n\nGiroud could have scored again with a firm downward header which veered wide but with the points safe there was no need for howls of frustration. Having sprinted off the pitch against Monaco as if he could not get away quick enough, this time he enjoyed some much-needed applause in the sunshine.\n\nMan of the match David Ospina (Arsenal)"},

Selhurst Park as a returning hero at the end of December, Crystal Palace were in danger of sinking without a trace. Neil Warnock had booked them on a one-way ticket to the Championship.\n\nYet Pardew’s decision to answer the cry for help from the club where he distinguished himself as a player has had a revitalising effect on this side. Survival is in sight for Palace after they produced a perfect away performance to beat West Ham United 3-1, a win that was capped by three assists from Jason Puncheon and two goals from Glenn Murray, whose afternoon was only slightly marred by a needless red card in the second half. The other potential sour note for Palace was the moment when their captain, Mile Jedinak, caught Diafra Sakho with an elbow near the end. Jedinak denied any intent but the Football Association may disagree. “I don’t think there’s anything malicious in it,”Pardew said.\n\nFor West Ham, the disappointment was stinging and their winless run now stretches to six matches. Their defending from set-pieces was abysmal and this was a defeat that raises more doubts about the prospect of Sam Allardyce earning a new deal at the end of the season. The pressure will intensify and those who want Allardyce to leave have been provided with more ammunition.\n\nFrom West Ham’s perspective, the first half was best summed up by a Mark Noble volley that went out for a throw and you knew the quality was low when even Alex Song’s radar was off. He was removed after 61 minutes.\n\nPalace’s plan, to squeeze the space in front of their back four and then use their pace on the break, worked a treat and they have a 100% record in their five away matches since Pardew was appointed. Noble curled an early free-kick against the bar, but Jedinak dominated midfield and the absence of Fraizer Campbell, Marouane Chamakh and Yaya Sanogo did not lessen Palace’s adventure.\n\nTheir injuries meant that Murray was given a rare start and he had already squandered three fine opportunities before he opened the scoring shortly before half-time. “He’s just got that nous,” Pardew said.\n\nA goal was not just on its way by the time Palace took the lead, it had called ahead to let West Ham know it was coming. Puncheon, who was labelled a “baller” by Pardew last week, floated a corner into the area from the right and although Murray’s header was on target, Aaron Cresswell should have dealt with it. Instead he sliced his attempted clearance and a wrong-footed Adrián could not stop the ball from trickling into the bottom-left corner. It was a farce.\n\nIf anything, West Ham were even worse at the start of the second half and Palace deservedly doubled their lead after 51 minutes, another Puncheon’s corner met by a thumping header from Scott Dann at the far post. Dann beat Reid too easily and he gave Adrián no chance.\n\nAllardyce brought on Nenê for his debut and the Brazilian winger curled a shot against the right post from 18 yards, but West Ham were a shambles.\n\nThey were vulnerable whenever they were defending set pieces, unusually so for an Allardyce side, and Murray made it 3-0 when he headed in Puncheon’s free-kick from the left. “Even though Palace were better than us today, we’ve lost the game on that basis,” Allardyce said. “When you concede three, that’s our fault.”\n\nMurray’s hopes of scoring a hat-trick were undone by a moment of madness. He had already gone close to picking up a second booking in the first half and he left Mike Dean with no alternative but to send him off when he caught the Reid with a late challenge. The red card forced Palace to defend and Valencia dragged West Ham back into the game when he swept a shot past Speroni from 20 yards with 14 minutes left.\n\nWest Ham had chances after that, yet the most damning indictment of their performance was that Valencia’s goal was their first shot on target.\n\nChelsea are the visitors to Upton Park on Wednesday."}, {"date": "28/02/2015", "arena": "Turf

Burnley’s grasp on their Premier League status is weakening. A side that competes admirably conceded farcically as Swansea secured victory at Turf Moor with a goal that involved Burnley’s past, in Jack Cork, and their present, as Kieran Trippier inadvertently applied the decisive touch. Burnley’s past six games have yielded two points and a chance to escape the relegation zone was spurned. With Liverpool and Manchester City their next two opponents, they face the prospect of an extended stay in the bottom three.\n\nIn contrast, Swansea’s destiny is decided. A fifth successive season in the top flight was rarely in doubt. Now it is a certainty. “Forty points is the first point of call for anyone outside the bigger clubs,” said their manager, Garry Monk. “We wanted to get there as soon as we could. We have got there now.”\n\nIt was an achievement he could savour, along with his side’s resilience. “We had to do the basics,” he said, taking pride in pragmatism. As a result, history repeated itself. In August, Swansea followed a 2-1 victory against Manchester United with a 1-0 win over Burnley. So, too, in February.\n\nTheir latest clean sheet owed much to their goalkeeper, Lukasz Fabianski. The Pole’s second-half saves from Michael Kightly, Ashley Barnes and the substitute Sam Vokes all showed his conviction. His finest stop came after a quarter of the game, when a spinning Danny Ings occupied three defenders, Barnes was left unmarked six yards from goal and Fabianski blocked the striker’s shot with his chest. “That was a big chance,” said the rueful Burnley manager, Sean Dyche.\n\nBarnes’s inability to take it ensured a return to obscurity after a week of notoriety. José Mourinho had branded his challenge on Nemanja Matic “criminal” but, after being vilified by the Chelsea manager, he was celebrated by the Burnley public and the recipient of the loudest pre-match ovation. “There is a respect element from fans to players here,” Dyche said. “They know they have a group giving everything.”\n\nAs ever, Burnley’s effort could not be faulted, but they lacked incision and invention. “There was a bit of flatness,” said Dyche, who wondered if the furore surrounding Barnes affected his team, but his side’s performance supported the long-held suspicions they do not possess the quality required to prosper. While Mourinho felt penalty decisions went Burnley’s way seven days earlier, they did not here when Neil Taylor tugged Vokes. “He gets dragged around his waist. I have seen them given,” said Dyche, who praised his striker for an understated reaction. “We value our honesty.”\n\nSwansea valued their industry. “We had to scrap it out,” said Monk. Fittingly, then, the decisive goal came in scrappy style. “It felt it was going to pan out as an indifferent 0-0,” said Dyche. Instead, Bafétimbi Gomis flicked on Jonjo Shelvey’s corner for Cork and when his shot was brilliantly touched on to the bar by Tom Heaton the midfielder miscued his attempt to convert the rebound. The grounded Heaton saved again, only to see the ball bounce in off Trippier’s thigh.\n\nIt was an indication of Shelvey’s influence. His playmaking skills were apparent as he released first Wayne Routledge and then Gomis with raking passes. The Englishman lobbed wide of an unguarded net and the French striker blazed way over the bar. Despite playing a part in the goal, Gomis gave a decidedly mixed display and his replacement, Nélson Oliveira, almost scored a second goal from an acute angle.\n\n“I don’t think there were too many chances for either side,” Monk said.

Once again United were far from fluent, once again the visitors were a shade unlucky, but once again the three points moved the home side up the table to keep alive Champions League hopes. United are flattered by their present position, tucked in behind Chelsea and Manchester City, yet they have been there for most of the season and despite appearing to be there for the taking they are still getting away with it.\n\nJonny Evans was booed midway through the first half for passing back to his own goalkeeper from halfway, before the United crowd once again implored the home team to “attack, attack, attack”. United never used to need any telling, but this current creation looks more like a collective tribute to Ray “The Crab” Wilkins’ passing style than a collection of internationals recently refitted to the tune of £150m.\n\nRobin van Persie missed this game through injury, meaning a more attacking role for Wayne Rooney, but as Van Gaal admitted beforehand he does not have a reliable, 20-goals-a-season striker in his squad. Just as well, since he does not have anyone to supply such a striker either.\n\nÁngel Di María continues to be a major disappointment, especially considering the £60m price tag. In the first half he kept giving away possession, frequently making the wrong decision and being knocked off the ball more easily than Radamel Falcao, which is saying something. Di María really ought to fit into United’s tradition of adventurous, buccaneering football yet, like most of his team-mates at the moment, the Argentinian does not seem relaxed enough to play his natural game.\n\nThe next time Evans received the ball on halfway he thought twice about passing back to David de Gea, but under pressure from Adam Johnson he did so anyway, to more jeers from his own crowd. When he finally managed a forward run it was brought loud applause, even though it was only a defender’s run that ultimately came to nothing. That is how desperate United supporters are at the moment, and that is the tension that is transmitting itself to the players.\n\nSunderland should have been in front by the interval, if only because they played without fear – if also without sophistication – and were given more than enough opportunities to take the lead by United’s sloppy ball retention. Connor Wickham brought the first save of the game from De Gea, after being allowed to run for far too long with the ball once Patrick van Aanholt had dispossessed Di María way back in the Sunderland half. Lee Cattermole then popped up to win possession on the edge of the United area for Jermain Defoe to bring another save from the goalkeeper, and the same player tested De Gea again after Wes Brown pinched the ball off Falcao with something resembling contemptuous ease.\n\nUnited did make a few chances, notably when John O’Shea diverted a shot from the lively Ashley Young against his own crossbar, but apart from a couple of attempts from free-kicks the home side did not manage to put much together. When Sunderland lost the ball in the centre circle just before the break Di María was perfectly positioned to pick it up and head for goal with options either side, yet to no one’s enormous surprise he produced a final pass that went to the one place in the penalty area where no red shirt was waiting.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Wes Brown shows his bemusement after being sent off. Photograph: PAUL ELLIS/AFP/Getty Images\n\nVan Gaal’s attempted solution was to replace Di María with Adnan Januzaj at the interval, a switch the crowd greeted with approval. The Belgian won a couple of quick corners and was not too far wide with a powerful drive when a Rooney free-kick was blocked, but nothing substantial changed and Marouane Fellaini was warming up on the touchline when a cross from Ander Herrera reached Falcao in the area. In attempting to dispossess him from behind, O’Shea pulled him over by the neck to concede a penalty.\n\nThe referee, Roger East, pointed immediately to the spot, which was fair enough, then showed the red card to Brown, which was plain wrong. Even O’Shea interceding on his team-mate’s behalf did nothing to change the official’s mind, and nor did radio communication with his assistants. Brown had to make the walk, even though he had done little more than arrive late on the scene as Falcao was going to ground, and departed shaking his head as Rooney confidently put away the penalty.\n\nAt least, and at last, it was a significant contribution from Falcao, but it was his final one. When Fellaini came on immediately after the goal the Colombian made way. Van Gaal confirmed he would have made the substitution had the game still been scoreless. “We needed to keep the ball more,” the United manager said.\n\nPlaying against 10 men, United made the scoreline more respectable five minutes from time when Rooney headed in from close range after a Januzaj shot had come back off the goalkeeper, but this was not convincing. United face Spurs and Liverpool in March, and if they or any other members of the chasing pack fail to take advantage they will be left kicking themselves."}, {"date": "28/02/2015", "arena": "St

became increasingly apparent, Tim Sherwood looked suspiciously like a man fighting the temptation to sprint on to the pitch and begin bossing midfield.\n\nThe scrappiest of afternoons concluded with Villa summoning no riposte to Papiss Cissé’s first-half winner, leaving their new manager in the thick of a relegation fight. Although Newcastle are safe enough in mid-table this was also a big game for John Carver with his players suggesting they are still very much behind him in the wake of last weekend’s 5-0 debacle at Manchester City.\n\n“It wasn’t pretty,” said Carver, who bravely fielded two wingers and two strikers in an extremely attacking formation. “But there’s huge relief in the dressing room. Players put their bodies on the line for the win.”\n\nSherwood was left hunting for positives. Ignoring choruses of “that’s why we’re going down” from the Villa fans, sitting high in Leazes End, he duly detected an upturn. “A much-improved performance,” he declared. “We were getting the ball wide, crossing and creating chances for Christian Benteke.”\n\nAdmittedly, on another day Villa might well have secured a draw but their final ball proved consistently wanting. “I never said it would be easy, I knew it would be tough and it’s getting tougher, but a win will come,” said Sherwood, still seeking his first point after two games in charge.\n\n“If we perform like that we’ve got more of a chance. There’s no lack of spirit in the dressing room, the boys really care but this is a massive football club and we’re under pressure.”\n\nNewcastle took the lead against the run of play. When Daryl Janmaat crossed from the right, Jores Okore failed to clear, leaving Cissé to control the bouncing ball before lashing his 11th goal of the season beyond Brad Guzan.\n\nAlthough Ashley Westwood contributed some superior, impressively incisive, passes from central midfield and Benteke forced Tim Krul into a fine save courtesy of an acrobatic overhead kick, the majority of the play was shapeless and incoherent. For large parts of the first half the latest gargantuan television deal and all the ‘best league in the world’ hype seemed an incredible marketing con trick.\n\nAt least we had a touch of human interest in the shape of the Sherwood show, down in the visiting technical area. Bar the odd thumbs-up for Westwood, Paul Lambert’s successor appeared anything but blown away by his new players. While his body language frequently screamed dismay – to the extent he sometimes looked in physical pain – Sherwood’s attendant torrent of expletives provided Villa’s bench with a running commentary on the team’s inadequacies.\n\nBadly missing the suspended Jack Colback’s midfield control, Newcastle were heavily reliant on their admittedly formidable counter-attacking acceleration. Yet if Sammy Ameobi’s penetrating pace on the break petrified Villa at times, Carver had reason to be grateful to Krul when the Holland goalkeeper saved superbly from Tom Cleverley after his connection with Benteke’s flick.\n\nShortly afterwards Benteke had a ‘goal’ disallowed for offside. With Janmaat and a much-improved Fabricio Coloccini defending particularly well in a resolutely stubborn home rearguard and Newcastle’s Ayoze Pérez hitting a post, the sense that it was not to be Sherwood’s day deepened. A cameo involving Coloccini performing wonders to block Westwood’s goal-bound shot felt entirely emblematic.\n\nBy now the visiting manager was prowling the touchline with arms folded and a fed-up frown. Indeed, with Westwood’s influence waning, Villa’s football increasingly mirrored Sherwood’s growing frustration.\n\nThe transition from bleak West Midlands midwinter to sun-dappled spring seems unlikely to be seamless."}, {"date": "28/02/2015", "arena": "Bet365 Stadium", "attendance": 26473, "home_team": {"name": "Stoke City", "lineup": [{"name": "Asmir Begovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [],

"Mark Hughes has accused Hull’s Maynor Figueroa of making a “horrendous tackle” on Stephen Ireland, rating the challenge as worse than Ashley Barnes’ on Nemanja Matic last weekend and hitting out at the officials for taking no action.\n\nHughes had to take Ireland off at half-time of his Stoke side’s 1-0 win because of a calf injury the midfielder sustained when being tackled by Figueroa just before the break. The manager after the game revealed Ireland had to have “something like 12 or 15 stitches” and claimed the Hull defender should have been shown a straight red card.\n\nThe referee Neil Swarbrick had allowed play to continue at the time and he and his assistant were strongly condemned by Hughes, who was quick to compare the incident to the one involving Burnley’s Barnes and Chelsea’s Matic at Stamford Bridge last Saturday, which has drawn so much attention over the past week.\n\nThe winner came in the 71st minute when Ireland’s replacement, Charlie Adam, delivered a cross that his fellow substitute Peter Crouch headed home. Reflecting on the victory, Hughes said: “We were really pleased. But I have to say, it is tempered somewhat because we have Stevie Ireland having been on the end of an horrendous tackle in the first half – one that should have seen a straight red card, to be perfectly honest.\n\n“Why the referee or his assistant haven’t seen the severity of that challenge … He [Ireland] has come in at half-time, rolled his sock down, and I think everyone was taken aback by the severity of the gash on his calf.\n\n“He has got something like 12 or 15 stitches in the leg wound, so for the officials to not see that challenge – I’ve seen it on video, and it is shocking.\n\n“I’m highlighting it not because I want to get anyone in trouble – I’m just saying that, on the day, I thought the referee was poor. We had two players shown yellow cards, and in comparison to that challenge on Stevie Ireland, I think it is remarkable, astounding that the referee hasn’t sent the lad straight off. They need to be better. The assistant referee was only 10 yards away for goodness’ sake, so he needs to see that challenge. It is a poor one.”\n\nJosé Mourinho labelled Barnes’ tackle on Matic – also not punished during the game – as “criminal”. Hughes said: “I think there has been a lot of debate about a certain challenge in the Chelsea-Burnley game and I think this one is actually worse than that.\n\n“Stevie didn’t get up and run after the lad because he wasn’t in a position to do so, due to the injury he had sustained.\n\n“We are upset by that challenge and what it might entail for Stevie – he is going to be missing for any number of weeks. It was a terrible challenge.\n\n“You just ask for the key moments in games to be refereed correctly, and I think that’s the main gripe at the moment – key decisions are not being made correctly, or things are being missed on too many occasions. It has to improve.”\n\nHull’s manager, Steve Bruce, had his own complaints about the officials, insisting Crouch – whose winning goal was his ninth of the season and fourth in four appearances – had been offside. “The defenders were adamant he was. They had done enough, because he is offside, but unfortunately, the linesman hasn’t seen it that way. You expect them to get those decisions right. It is disappointing.\n\n“I don’t think we ever deserved to win the match, but you don’t expect to lose to something like that, not at this level.\n\n“I know they have a difficult job – they get put under pressure from all sorts of people here. But if the linesman does his job properly, then we get a point.”"}, {"date": "28/02/2015", "arena": "The Hawthorns", "attendance": 25303, "home_team": {"name": "West Bromwich Albion", "lineup": [{"name": "Ben Foster", "yellows": [62], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Craig Dawson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gareth McAuley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joleon Lescott", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Brunt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Morrison", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [72]}, {"name": "Claudio Yacob", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Darren Fletcher", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Craig Gardner", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Brown Ideye", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [88]}, {"name": "Saido Berahino", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [2], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [56]}], "subs": [{"name": "Andre Wisdom", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonas Olsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Baird", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [88], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Boaz Myhill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Callum McManaman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Youssouf Mulumbu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [56], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stéphane Sessegnon", "yellows": [82], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [72], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Southampton", "lineup": [{"name": "Fraser Forster", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Florin Gardos", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [25]}, {"name": "José Fonte", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Maya Yoshida", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathaniel Clyne", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Wanyama", "yellows": [29], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Morgan Schneiderlin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Bertrand", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dusan Tadic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [74]}, {"name": "Graziano Pellè", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sadio Mané", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Kelvin Davis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shane Long", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [74], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Davis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Filip Djuricic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Ward-Prowse", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eljero Elia", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [25], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matt Targett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "It is a bad stage of the season for the goals to dry up for Southampton and Ronald Koeman could also be forgiven for lamenting the timing of their visit to The Hawthorns. West Bromwich Albion are a team transformed under Tony Pulis, with this narrow but crucial victory lifting the Midlands club eight points clear of the relegation zone and featuring the now customary clean sheet.\n\nSouthampton became the seventh team to fail to score against Albion in Pulis’s 10 games in charge and also the victims of yet another Saido Berahino goal. The game was only 70 seconds old when the Albion striker dispatched a volley of the highest quality to take his tally for the season to 17 in all competitions.\n\nCaught cold on that occasion, Southampton warmed up after Koeman scrapped his three-man defence midway through the first half, but the visitors never really turned the heat up on a superbly organised Albion team who showed all the hallmarks of Pulis’s work on the training ground.\n\nFor Southampton, it is now only four points and one goal from five games and, quite naturally, the spotlight will shine on Graziano Pellè, who has failed to score in 10 league matches and was guilty of squandering the sort of chance that would have ended up in the back of the net earlier in the season. Ryan Bertrand’s low centre midway through the second half needed only a touch but Pellè, six yards out, failed to make any contact and the ball bounced off Chris Brunt and ended up behind.\n\nFive minutes from time opportunity knocked for Pellè again, when Morgan Schneiderlin’s header dropped at his feet, but the Italian’s turn and swivel ended up with a tame shot rolling into the arms of Ben Foster. It was one of the few saves that the Albion goalkeeper had to make on a hugely frustrating afternoon for Southampton, who remain fifth, two points behind Arsenal having played a game more.\n\nAsked whether the early goal was a bit of a killer for Southampton, Koeman said: “I think more than a bit, because we expect the way how they played – good organisation – but after the goal they are defending more, they drop more and then you have to be very good in creating because there is no space.\n\n“But I think the difference was they won much more second balls than we did. We tried everything but we didn’t create a lot, maybe one big chance of Pellè and the next one a bit more difficult. The first one I think he missed the ball.”\n\nSouthampton have bounced back from a wobble before but the momentum is with their rivals at the moment. “I was always realistic,” Koeman said. “Never was I thinking we would qualify for the Champions League, a lot of big teams normally fight for that position. But we try to win more points than Southampton did last season.”\n\nWhile the Dutch manager lamented Southampton’s lack of “attention” in the lead up to Berahino’s goal, there was nothing Fraser Forster could do to keep out the forward’s volley, which flashed into the top corner after Maya Yoshida, under pressure from Craig Dawson, could only half-clear Brunt’s deep free-kick.\n\n“It’s a wonderful goal, there’s no questioning his talent,” Pulis said. “He’s top-class and over the past couple of weeks he’s really bought into what we are trying to do when we haven’t got the ball. His attitude has been very good. He’s the icing on the cake, that little bit of extra quality that every team is looking for.”\n\nThe only downsides for Albion were the sight of Berahino limping off early in the second half and Brown Ideye also picking up a knock late on. Both strikers had injections before the game and now face a race against time to be fit for the derby at Aston Villa on Tuesday."}, {"date": "22/02/2015", "arena": "White Hart Lane", "attendance":

the West Ham midfielder had a moment to ask himself the question.\n\nHarry Kane had not looked to be in an overly threatening position because Aaron Cresswell, the West Ham full-back, was covering, but Song momentarily lost his composure. He put his hands on Kane, the contact was clear, the Tottenham striker went down and the referee, Jon Moss, was compelled to give the penalty.\n\nFor Tottenham it was the prompt for yet another important late goal while for West Ham it would represent the frittering away of yet another lead. Kane did not score from the spot, Adrián reading his intentions and saving the kick but when the rebound fell kindly to him, he knocked in his 24th goal of a sensational season.\n\nIt was the last kick of a pulsating derby and if Tottenham could feel relief, having trailed by two goals with nine minutes to play, there was only nausea for West Ham.\n\nThey had arrived in sticky form after an FA Cup hiding at West Bromwich Albion. Moreover, the future of the manager, Sam Allardyce, continued to represent an unwelcome distraction. Out of contract in the summer, the club’s owners have no plans, at present, to even discuss a renewal, despite him having exceeded expectations this season.\n\nBut for so long, it appeared that Allardyce and the travelling support were primed to celebrate another victory at this stadium – to go with the two from last season, in the Premier League and Capital One Cup. They had taken charge upon Cheikhou Kouyaté’s first-half header and when Diafra Sakho got the second on 62 minutes, the die seemed to be cast. Tottenham had Hugo Lloris to thank for keeping the scoreline at 2-0.\n\nYet Danny Rose’s streaky goal sparked the Spurs fightback and although this was not the result that they wanted in the race for a top-four finish – and to capitalise on Manchester United’s loss at Swansea City on Saturday – they were more than happy to take it.\n\nTottenham have won 13 points this season thanks to goals in the final five minutes of matches and it is becoming a recurring theme to hear Mauricio Pochettino, the manager, salute the never-say-die attitude of his players.\n\nThis was a contest that was dotted with spicy challenges and errors on the ball, with the majority of the latter coming from Tottenham in the first half. Mousa Dembélé was the biggest culprit and when he lost possession in his own defensive third, West Ham exacted full punishment. They worked the ball smartly to Cresswell and his cross was headed in by Kouyaté.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sam Allardyce shows his disappointment after West Ham’s 2-2 daw at Tottenham.\n\nDembélé endured something of a nightmare and it was no surprise when he did not reappear for the second half. He was replaced by Christian Eriksen, who had been the surprise omission from Pochettino’s starting XI.\n\nTottenham had begun as the brighter of the teams and they went close to taking the lead. Nabil Bentaleb worked Adrián from distance while Kane charged on to Rose’s long ball and guided a shot against the outside of a post.\n\nKouyaté’s goal settled West Ham while it unnerved Tottenham. Dembélé was not the only player in a white shirt whose passing sights were awry and the crowd could not help but show their frustration. Although Rose went close with a 26th-minute header, it was West Ham who came to look more dangerous.\n\nLloris blocked from Sakho and Enner Valencia in the first half, and he thwarted Sakho again on 58 minutes, after Mark Noble had put him clean through.\n\nSakho, though, would not be denied and, following Noble’s cross and with the Tottenham defence again in disarray, he volleyed home from a tight angle at the far post. Valencia was in an offside position in the middle and Pochettino argued that he had interfered with play.\n\nWest Ham had a let-off when Noble – already booked for a shirt tug on Andros Townsend – lunged in to catch Bentaleb on an ankle. The referee spared him a second yellow card but Tottenham had a bigger let-off when Winston Reid headed square for Valencia and from point-blank range, he was denied by Lloris.\n\nThere had been no hint of the grandstand finish but Tottenham started it when Rose’s shot, after a corner had been half-cleared, bounced down into the ground and looped up and over Adrián into the corner. But, just as it looked as though time would defeat Tottenham, Song suffered his rush of blood.\n\nMan of the match Aaron Cresswell (West Ham United)"}, {"date": "22/02/2015", "arena": "Goodison Park",

during Everton’s recent defeat at Stamford Bridge but his problems lie much closer to home. Leicester City, who are bottom of the table, became the 10th of 13 visitors to leave Goodison Park with at least a point in the Premier League this season and would have departed with a precious away win but for an 88th-minute own goal. No wonder Everton have frozen next year’s season-ticket prices.\n\nTim Howard was at fault for both Leicester goals as two of the substitutes, Jamie Vardy and David Nugent, injected potency and creativity into the visiting display, while Romelu Lukaku squandered a host of clear-cut chances before forcing the unfortunate Matthew Upson to put through his own net two minutes from time. Martínez absolved Howard of blame for the result and claimed “the fear of having something to lose” was responsible for Everton’s lack of composure in defence. In keeping with his decision to recall Howard at the expense of Joel Robles, once the veteran keeper had recovered from a calf injury, the argument did not stack up.\n\nFor Leicester, what may yet prove a valuable point in their fight to avoid relegation seemed like a cause for despair on the final whistle. Nigel Pearson’s team carried the greater threat throughout, only not in sufficient numbers until the manager’s double substitution paid immediate dividends. They heightened Goodison’s understandable anxiety with two swift goals to take the lead with 20 minutes to go, both created by Vardy and involving Howard errors, but were pegged back when Lukaku threw himself at Christian Atsu’s cross and his diving header deflected in off Upson.\n\n“The dressing room is very disappointed because we did very well,” said Pearson. “We have got to turn these sorts of performances into wins. I thought we played well, we showed a lot of discipline, understanding of the system and both of their goals had an element of raising your eyebrows – a scuffed shot going through your legs and the last touch coming off Matty. But there is no point in talking about being unlucky. If we apply ourselves in the way we did today and at Arsenal, I think we will be fine.”\n\nMartínez cited tiredness as a factor in Everton’s laboured display and for Lukaku’s profligacy following Thursday’s 4-1 win at Young Boys in the Europa League. His team have won only two of seven league games following European exertions but results have been no better without the added demands of the competition.\n\nThe distraction excuse does not apply. If anything, the Europa League should have enhanced Everton’s self-belief given their best performances of the season have come against Wolfsburg, Lille and in Berne. But convincing, clinical victories in Europe are not being replicated domestically. This was another league display lacking intensity and ingenuity from Everton, at least until the introduction of Atsu and the impressive Darron Gibson, and it is now six consecutive home games without a win.\n\nJeff Schlupp should have put Leicester ahead at the start of the second half (there was nothing to report from the first) when Howard parried Matty James’s shot into his path but the Ghana international shot wide. The goalkeeper’s reprieve would be short-lived.\n\nMartínez withdrew the anonymous Ross Barkley to polite applause and the industrious Muhamed Besic to widespread boos but the complaints ceased when Lukaku released Steven Naismith inside the area. The Scot cut inside Wes Morgan and squeezed a shot between the Leicester captain and Robert Huth that trickled inside the near post with Mark Schwarzer stranded. Leicester had a penalty claim for a handball by Seamus Coleman dismissed seconds earlier. “It has hit his hand but it would have been harsh,” admitted Pearson.\n\nLeicester responded vibrantly. Vardy broke clear of James McCarthy far too easily down the right and drilled in a low cross that Howard pushed into the path of Nugent via a slight touch off John Stones. The boyhood Evertonian duly converted from three yards and kept his celebrations in check. Moments later, after Lukaku had shot over when put clear by McCarthy, Howard flapped at Danny Simpson’s deep cross and Vardy returned the loose ball for Esteban Cambiasso to fire beyond the struggling keeper.\n\nEverton were staring at a damaging defeat when Lukaku, having missed another good chance from Naismith’s pass, made amends by forcing an unfortunate own goal from the Leicester central defender.\n\n“When Tim [Howard] is fully fit he is a very strong performer,” said Martínez. “I think we conceded the goals because we had a fear of conceding rather than a player making the wrong decision. As a team we need to defend much better in those situations. I don’t see Tim as directly responsible for the draw.”\n\nMan of the match Jamie Vardy\n\n(Leicester City)"}, {"date": "22/02/2015", "arena": " Mary's Stadium", "attendance": 31723, "home_team": {"name": "Southampton", "lineup": [{"name": "Fraser Forster", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathaniel Clyne", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "José Fonte", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Maya Yoshida", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matt Targett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Ward-Prowse", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [57]}, {"name": "Victor Wanyama", "yellows": [63], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Davis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Filip Djuricic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [75]}, {"name": "Graziano Pellè", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eljero Elia", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Kelvin Davis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Morgan Schneiderlin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Florin Gardos", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shane Long", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sadio Mané", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [57], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dusan Tadic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [75], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harrison Reed", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Liverpool", "lineup": [{"name": "Simon Mignolet", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dejan Lovren", "yellows": [43], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Skrtel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Emre Can", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordon Ibe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [75]}, {"name": "Jordan Henderson", "yellows": [84], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Allen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lazar Markovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Adam Lallana", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [62]}, {"name": "Philippe Coutinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [3], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Raheem Sterling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [73], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Glen Johnson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [75], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kolo Touré", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rickie Lambert", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daniel Sturridge", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [62], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alberto Moreno", "yellows": [78], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mario Balotelli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Ward", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "The Liverpool revival is carrying them inexorably towards the Champions League. A glance at the manic celebrations among visiting players at the final whistle here, all pumped fists and satisfied smiles amid the deluge, showed the significance of this win. Damage has been inflicted on direct rivals in pursuit of European qualification, victory at Southampton’s expense reinforcing the sense that momentum is increasingly with the Merseyside club.\n\nThis ended up as a show of strength, a win chiselled out from opponents who remain a point clear in fifth but who now feel Liverpudlian breath on their necks. The locals whipped themselves into a frenzy at the perceived oversights of the referee, Kevin Friend, with some of their complaints at the refusal of spot-kicks justified, but even they had played through the latter stages as if resigned to the inevitability of this reverse. When Liverpool succumbed 3-0 at Old Trafford in mid-December they had trailed Manchester United by 10 points. Fast forward through 10 unbeaten league games and they are two points adrift of those opponents and only one more from Arsenal in third.\n\nThe management’s ability to coax such a persuasive renaissance from a campaign that had once been on the point of unravelling merits considerable praise. Certainly that spluttering return to Europe’s elite competition back in the autumn, which so affected their domestic form, seems a world away. Brendan Rodgers can approach collisions with Manchester City, United and Arsenal in their next five matches with the thrill of anticipation.\n\n“There might have been anxiety at the beginning of the season ahead of games like that, given how we were playing at the time, but we can relish every match we play now,” he said. “For us this was a big step. To go three points behind Arsenal, considering the start we had … that shows the consistency we have found. We’ll use the experience of last year in the run-in, when we just missed out (on the title). Hopefully we can keep the focus and mentality and the performance levels.”\n\nThere is conviction fuelling their challenge at present. A reshaped defence – even with one of the locals’ hate figures, Dejan Lovren, standing in for the injured Mamadou Sakho – rode its luck amid the calls for a home penalty but emerged with a fifth successive clean sheet away from home in the league for the first time in 30 years. Their closest shave was when Joe Allen swung a leg and up-ended Filip Djuricic in the penalty box, the ball breaking to Eljero Elia who should have scored only for Simon Mignolet to save with his feet. Djuricic felt he might have earned a penalty in the opening 20 seconds, sensing Emre Can’s hand on his shoulder if then tumbling too theatrically. “The first one was a little bit light, and this is England, so there are a different type of criteria for the penalty,” said the Serbian midfielder. “But the second one, definitely.”\n\n“Maybe Djuricic, in that first moment, fell down a bit too easily in the box,” said Ronald Koeman. “The second, there’s no question. I don’t understand the referee. But OK, human people can do mistakes.” Lovren also appeared to handle at a corner just before the interval, while Mignolet deflected Elia’s shot from his chest on to his outstretched arm having charged out of his area to block. List the flashpoints and local displeasure at Friend’s display felt more understandable.\n\nYet the home side’s threat was more fitful after the interval, their rhythm not as menacing as it has often been this season. Quality rather drowned in the incessant downpour, with anxiety inevitably creeping in. The contest’s decisive second goal, stemming from Morgan Schneiderlin’s surrender of possession and Matt Targett’s slip, was born of frustration and dispatched with glee by Raheem Sterling.\n\nThat settled a game which had been illuminated by Philippe Coutinho’s glorious opener while Southampton were still digesting that first denial of a spot-kick. The Brazilian had been granted a pocket of space 30 yards out in which to collect Lazar Markovic’s pass, spin the ball out of his feet and conjure a shot of such vicious whip and dip that Fraser Forster was rendered utterly helpless as it careered in off the underside of the bar.\n\nCoutinho has appeared leggy at times of late, struggling with a cluttered schedule, but that was sparkling reward. With Sterling ,Jordan Ibe and Daniel Sturridge in the ranks there was scope to stretch the home side on the counter thereafter. Adam Lallana and Lovren, the focus of local vitriol, could busy themselves with the task in hand as the boos rang out to mark their every touch. Liverpool cared little.\n\nThey have lost only once in 18 matches in all competitions, a sequence taking them from lower mid-table into contention. “An outstanding win, a wonderful win, very controlled,” added Rodgers. “It’s still about taking small steps. The first period of this season was nothing like what we’ve been during my time at the club. We had to find a solution, so we restructured the team, organised it in a different way to get that solidity back and the players’ response has been magnificent. This was a huge win.”\n\nMan of the match Philippe Coutinho (Liverpool)"}, {"date": "21/02/2015", "arena": "Villa Park", "attendance": 31880, "home_team": {"name": "Aston Villa", "lineup": [{"name":

"report": "Aston Villa lost their captain and the match in stoppage time when Ron Vlaar was sent off for conceding the penalty that Victor Moses scored to leave Tim Sherwood “devastated” after his first game in charge of the club.\n\n“No one feels as down as I am,” the new Villa manager said as Stoke City remained on course for another top-half finish after a match Sherwood reckoned neither side deserved to win.\n\nThat the feelgood factor around Sherwood’s arrival dissipated so rapidly is almost as concerning as Villa’s performance and the sixth straight league defeat that keeps them in the relegation zone with 12 games remaining.\n\nThe former Tottenham Hotspur manager has generated such positivity over the past week since he arrived as Paul Lambert’s successor that a win in reaction to the miserable months preceding it seemed an inevitability against a Stoke side who had lost their previous two games 4-1 and been besieged by injuries.\n\nBut while Villa at least started energetically and scored a fine goal through Scott Sinclair, they conceded in time added on at the end of each half, Mame Diouf equalising before Moses capitalised on Vlaar’s faux pas, leaving them with no time to recover in either instance. This was the ultimate party-pooping, Sherwood’s bonfire thoroughly doused. How he himself recovers on Sunday – his players are accustomed to losing – before taking training on Monday could be crucial.\n\n“We have to put this behind us now and not dwell on it,” he said. “I can be devastated now but I won’t be devastated on Monday. Games come thick and fast and before you know it, if you’re dwelling on the last result, games are running out.” Villa travel to Newcastle United on Saturday then entertain West Bromwich Albion twice in four days. The Premier League derby that midweek is arguably more important than the FA Cup quarter-final.\n\nAt least Sherwood did not attempt to dress this performance up as something it was not. “It wasn’t great,” he admitted. “I thought it was going to be a work in progress and a lot of work needs to be done. I was encouraged with some performances: Scott Sinclair was very good, the two centre-backs, Kieran Richardson was very lively, Alan Hutton gave us a threat on the right side.\n\n“We need to work on it and continue to get on the ball in [significant] areas in the field – we need to be brave and go and get the football and try and affect the football match. I am sure we have the quality in the squad. It is going to be about putting the right jigsaw together at certain times to win the games.”\n\nIn the build-up to the Villa goal, their 13th in 26 league games, Phil Bardsley and Sinclair had both fallen to the ground from an aerial collision after the initial corner. But with the Stoke full-back still injured, Sinclair bounced back up and, when Fabian Delph retrieved the ball on the far side and dispatched a delicious cross to the near post, the winger on loan from Manchester City glanced a delicate but decisive header on beyond Asmir Begovic into the corner of the net.\n\nIt was Sinclair’s first goal in the Premier League since August 2012 but, coming on the back of his effort in last week’s FA Cup victory over Leicester City, the former England Under-21 flier certainly looks determined to make his mark at Villa Park. With Carles Gil buzzing enthusiastically on the other wing, few would doubt the quality of Lambert’s final two Villa signings.\n\nVilla lacked no energy during this lively opening but, as Stoke started to dominate midfield with their superior touch and movement off the ball, Gabriel Agbonlahor and Sinclair utilised their athleticism to drop back from the front line to track opponents. Villa may have switched to 4-4-2 but there was plenty of support for the central midfielders. That did sap Agbonlahor’s potency as an offensive threat, however, while Christian Benteke, apart from a late header from Delph’s cross that was deflected wide, is still to find his stride.\n\nStoke, with four of their walking wounded back from injury, dominated play in the second quarter and a minute before the interval Diouf headed in the equaliser, his seventh goal of the season, from Stephen Ireland’s cross after Jonathan Walters’ layoff. “We switched off just before half-time from a throw-in and conceded,” Sherwood said. “It knocks the stuffing out of you.”\n\nAll Villa’s efforts were focused on trying and running as hard as possible. But Stoke were able to play round them with ease at times, with Ireland springing from midfield with invention and a deft touch, and when Vlaar not only misplaced a pass straight to Moses but then tripped him up as he tried to make amends, he paid a double penalty. “We knew there would be an impact from the positivity of a new manager coming in but we never allowed Villa to get any momentum,” Mark Hughes, the Stoke manager, said. “This was a great away victory for us.”"}, {"date": "21/02/2015", "arena": "Stamford Bridge", "attendance": 41629, "home_team": {"name": "Chelsea", "lineup":

Chelsea should have expected a deviation from their script. After all, the week had begun with the club revealing they had chosen this match to mark their second annual equality day but that announcement was soon drowned out by howls of disgust after a handful of their fans exposed themselves as racist oafs on the Paris Métro before Tuesday’s Champions League game with Paris Saint-Germain. An uneventful return to action on the pitch would have been welcome but instead Chelsea were denied two points by Burnley in a game that ended in ugly recriminations.\n\nIt would be a stretch to say that Chelsea’s title charge came off the rails here but it did stall, at least. José Mourinho’s side lost not only points but also a key player, with Nemanja Matic being sent off in the second half for reacting violently to a dangerous challenge by Ashley Barnes. Chelsea were leading at that point thanks to Branislav Ivanovic’s goal in the first half but Burnley equalised against the 10 men when Ben Mee headed in from a corner nine minutes from time.\n\nBoth sides sought a decisive goal in a frenetic finish but ultimately the league leaders and the side fighting relegation shared the points and Mourinho wound up making dark allusions to the influence of officials.\n\nJosé Mourinho blames referee for Nemanja Matic’s dismissal Read more\n\nChelsea had wanted to send out positive messages – first to society, as, in the match programme and on giant screens at Stamford Bridge, various senior figures, including John Terry, condemned the idiocy of the fans on the Métro, and a group of supporters in the Shed End held aloft a home-made banner declaring “Black or white, we’re all Blue”; and second to Manchester City, who would have kicked off their evening match against Newcastle United 10 points adrift if Chelsea registered the expected victory.\n\nEvents on the pitch began promisingly for the hosts. The Burnley goalkeeper, Tom Heaton, was forced into a one-handed save in the fifth minute when Juan Cuadrado sent a header towards goal from 15 yards after meeting a cross from Filipe Luís. But all season Burnley have been on a mission to subvert the established order and Sean Dyche’s gallant band of rebels soon showed their teeth in the sixth minute when Barnes’s fine volley was well saved by Thibault Courtois.\n\nFor all their laudable attributes, Burnley do not have a player of Eden Hazard’s ingenuity. Few teams do. In the 14th minute the dazzling Belgian showcased his rare skills by skedaddling past three defenders in the penalty area before pulling the ball back for Ivanovic to tuck into the net from close range. That was a repetition of one Parisian event Chelsea did not mind seeing again, with this goal taking the defender’s tally for the season to six.\n\nBack on home turf, Chelsea fans condemn club’s Paris racism shame Read more\n\nBurnley continued to pose problems but were kept mostly at arm’s length by Chelsea. Courtois made another stop from a long-range effort from Barnes. Barnes was then involved in a challenge with Ivanovic that Mourinho suggested should have resulted in a dismissal for the visitor but the referee saw nothing wrong.\n\nDiego Costa, as in Paris, was struggling to rediscover the form he showed before his three-game suspension but in the 32nd minute he did well to find Cuadrado, who set up Ivanovic for another shot, this time from 20 yards. The Serb’s drive was blocked by Michael Kightly’s flailing arm and Chelsea demanded a penalty, but Martin Atkinson seemingly deemed it accidental.\n\nChelsea appealed in the 43rd minute when Costa collapsed in the box following contact from Jason Shackell. Mourinho, who claims his striker gets a raw deal from officials, threw his arms to the skies in supposed disbelief when the referee waved play on, but the decision seemed fair – Shackell’s hands did touch Costa but it was hardly the sort of shove that would, for example, prevent a commuter from boarding a train.\n\nChelsea improved at the start of the second half, though Burnley were the first to threaten a goal. In the 50th minute Barnes brought Courtois’s best save so far with a deflected drive from 18 yards, the keeper diverting it over with one hand.\n\nChelsea immediately went close at the other end as Ivanovic sent a header towards goal from a corner. Burnley scrambled the ball away despite Matic’s attempt to help it over the line. Hazard then sent Costa scampering towards the box but the striker’s shot weakly at Heaton.\n\nJosé Mourinho spot-on with response to Chelsea fans’ Paris incident | Paul Wilson Read more\n\nIvanovic was ubiquitous. In the 58th minute he clipped an inviting cross from the right towards Costa, but the forward failed to apply a decisive touch from close range.\n\nChelsea seemed to be tightening their grip but Matic lost his head. The midfielder was angered by Barnes’s dangerous follow-through in a tackle and showed his fury by charging at the player and pushing him to the ground. The referee issued a red card and Matic briefly had to be held back by team-mates before accepting the decision and jogging down the tunnel.\n\nMourinho sought to shore up midfield and was intending to introduce Gary Cahill for Costa in the 81st minute as Burnley lined up a corner following a fine save by Courtois from another Barnes shot, but he could not make the change in time and had to watch aghast as Mee rose above Ramires and headed Trippier’s delivery into the net. Both managers made attacking changes in search of a winner and Burnley came closest to snatching it, Ings firing over after a swift counter-ttack in stoppage time."}, {"date": "21/02/2015", "arena": "Selhurst Park", "attendance": 24721, "home_team": {"name": "Crystal Palace", "lineup": [{"name": "Julian Speroni", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joel Ward", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Scott Dann", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Damien Delaney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pape Souaré", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Ledley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [80]}, {"name": "Wilfried Zaha", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jason Puncheon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordon Mutch", "yellows": [19], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dwight Gayle", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [79]}, {"name": "Fraizer Campbell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [57]}], "subs": [{"name": "Brede Hangeland", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yannick Bolasie", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [57], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wayne Hennessey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mile Jedinak", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Glenn Murray", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [90], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [79], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shola Ameobi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [80], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Kelly", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Arsenal", "lineup": [{"name": "David Ospina", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Calum Chambers", "yellows": [85], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Per Mertesacker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Laurent Koscielny", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nacho Monreal", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Francis Coquelin", "yellows": [28], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Santi Cazorla", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [8], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Welbeck", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [77]}, {"name": "Mesut Özil", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [76]}, {"name": "Alexis Sánchez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [89]}, {"name": "Olivier Giroud", "yellows": [56], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [45], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Wojciech Szczesny", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kieran Gibbs", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [77], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gabriel Paulista", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [89], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tomas Rosicky", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [76], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Wilshere", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Theo Walcott", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Hector Bellerin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Now Arsenal know how Liverpool felt when Crystal Palace mounted that famous fightback from 3-0 down last season. Well, almost. Unlike Liverpool, Arsenal escaped Selhurst Park with the points and their pride intact but only after surviving the almightiest of scares when Palace’s desperate, manic push for the unlikeliest of equalisers culminated in Glenn Murray, who had just scored, heading against the post in stoppage-time and the ball rebounding back into David Ospina’s loving embrace. Mark Clattenburg blew his final whistle a minute or two later and Arsenal could breathe a huge sigh of relief and celebrate a victory that moved them up to third.\n\nArsenal being Arsenal, there had to be drama.

It had been a cruise for Arsène Wenger’s side once Santi Cazorla put them ahead with a penalty, before Olivier Giroud made it 2-0 just before half-time, and it was looking straightforward even when the board went up to show there would be five minutes of added time.\n\nArsenal were solid, resilient and thoroughly professional, defending well and taking their chances with aplomb.\n\nSwansea City 2-1 Manchester United | Premier League match report Read more\n\nYet the day ended with Wenger admitting that his players were guilty of switching off and Alan Pardew, whose Newcastle United side once fought back from 4-0 down against Arsenal to draw 4-4, agonising over that Murray header. “It just wasn’t to be,” Crystal Palace’s manager said.\n\nAnd yet it almost was. Palace, who have won only one of their last five games, were short on ideas for long spells and Arsenal comfortably absorbed everything that they threw at them. Laurent Koscielny and Per Mertesacker were commanding in central defence and it was telling that Ospina did not have to make a meaningful save until there were only a few minutes left on the clock.\n\nPardew’s claim that Palace deserved more did not entirely ring true, even though his complaints that Arsenal’s second goal should have been disallowed for offside appeared justified.\n\nThe truth was that Palace left it too late and they were also their own worst enemies at times, not least when Pape Souaré conceded the penalty that allowed Cazorla to give Arsenal the lead. “The first goal is a mistake, he should do better,” Pardew said. “He needs to learn from that.”\n\nIt was a gift. The game was still in its sparring stages when Souaré dithered over a clearance, allowing the typically persistent Danny Welbeck to win the ball and drive towards the Palace goal from the right.\n\nIn the blink of an eye, Palace were in trouble and Souaré, attempting to salvage a situation that was caused by his tentativeness, panicked and clumsily brought down Welbeck. The challenge started just outside the area but continued inside, and Clattenburg pointed to the spot.\n\nChelsea 1-1 Burnley | Premier League match report Read more\n\nThe Palace fans behind the goal seethed at the injustice of it all, yet there was an obvious tangle of legs and Cazorla made the most of Welbeck’s opportunism by ignoring the boos and sending Julián Speroni the wrong way from 12 yards.\n\nThe frustration for Palace was that Arsenal were not at their sparkling best for much of the first half. Pardew’s side competed with energy and snap in midfield, but there was no cutting edge or subtlety without the intelligent promptings of Marouane Chamakh, out injured, just a lot of fast attackers taking it in turns to speed down various blind alleys. Arsenal were happy to usher Palace down them.\n\nThere were a couple of scrambles inside the Arsenal box but never a sense that Palace could offer anything more incisive.\n\nPalace huffed and puffed and then Arsenal blew them away with one puff of the cheeks just before half-time. Alexis Sánchez slipped a pass through to Welbeck, the flag stayed down, Speroni saved and Giroud swept the rebound into the empty net. It was all very perfunctory.\n\nPalace increased the intensity at the start of the second half. Jason Puncheon curled a free-kick just wide, Dwight Gayle headed over and Yannick Bolasie’s introduction made life more awkward for Calum Chambers.\n\nWilfried Zaha should have scored after Ospina flapped at one Bolasie cross.\n\nYet Francis Coquelin was an efficient screen in front of the Arsenal defence and Sánchez should have added a third goal before the hour, only to poke his shot inches wide after fine work from Mesut Özil.\n\nIf anything, it was too easy for Arsenal and their concentration dropped. “They thought it’s done,” Wenger said. “In the Premier League, it’s never done.”\n\nPardew gave his attack more beef by throwing on Shola Ameobi and Murray and the latter dragged Palace back into the game in stoppage-time, turning the ball in after Ospina saved Zaha’s shot.\n\nArsenal, however, held on and denied Palace another famous comeback."}, {"date": "21/02/2015", "arena": "KCOM Stadium", "attendance": 24466, "home_team": {"name": "Hull City", "lineup":

career contributed to a return to their losing ways on the road.\n\nThe QPR captain was dismissed just after the half-hour after a moment that rekindled images of Vinnie Jones and Paul Gascoigne in a Wimbledon-Newcastle encounter in 1988. The only difference being that Barton’s contact with Tom Huddlestone’s private parts (via a swinging low blow rather than a grab) took place in full view of the referee, Anthony Taylor.\n\nIt took place after the QPR debutant Darnell Furlong crunched into Nikica Jelavic in front of the dugouts. Players from both sides gathered around the official and Barton first pushed away Hull’s Alex Bruce before aiming a below-the-belt swipe at Huddlestone.\n\n“I’ve apologised to the lads and would like to apologise to all QPR fans who travelled today,” tweeted Barton, who claimed the home players were trying to get Furlong sent off. “I’m gutted I got sent off. I’ve let my team-mates down today and being someone who puts the team above everything else I’m gutted about that.\n\n“My actions towards Huddlestone were certainly not malicious, it was a stupid reaction to being barged but I can appreciate it wasn’t right.”\n\nChris Ramsey, in his first match since being appointed as manager for the rest of the season, said he would make a judgment on Barton’s behaviour when emotions had died down. “I haven’t been around Joey all his career. All I can do is judge him on how he’s been since I’ve been in the post. He’s been a fantastic professional. It’s an incident that we wouldn’t have wanted to happen but the players reacted well to keep going for that long with 10 men.”\n\nIndeed, the loss of Barton, who had created a Premier League record of being booked in his previous seven appearances, galvanised the visitors, who trailed to Jelavic’s opening goal on the quarter-hour. The Croatian striker back-pedalled in anticipation of a poor clearance by Steven Caulker and thrashed a volley from a dozen yards out that left Rob Green helpless.\n\nHaving broken a sequence of 11 top-flight defeats at Sunderland in their last outing QPR dealt admirably with the handicap of playing with one short for an hour. They equalised six minutes before the interval when a flowing move, the most attractive of the match, involving Furlong and Bobby Zamora, resulted in Matt Phillips bisecting Bruce and Michael Dawson with an arrow of a cross that the returning Charlie Austin headed in.\n\nThe hobbling celebration that followed offered a reminder of what Hull could have had – Austin agreed to a £4.5m move from Burnley in July 2013 only for the club to pull out of the deal due to concerns over his knee post-medical.\n\n“I congratulated Charlie for the way he’s handled himself after what happened here because it wasn’t easy,” said Steve Bruce, the Hull manager. “He showed the manner and dignity of a proper man. He didn’t even know he had a bad knee. But he’s certainly a proper centre-forward and our loss is certainly QPR’s gain.”\n\nIt was Austin’s second goal in eight matches but gave QPR something to cling to, and they were accomplished in protecting Green. Until, that is, the 89th minute when, with four Hull forwards on the pitch, one substitute, Sone Aluko, crossed and another, Abel Hernández, flicked on. N’Doye’s effort was foiled at point-blank range by the England goalkeeper. Cruelly, the danger had not been averted and when Brady slung the ball back into the area, N’Doye celebrated his 30th birthday by heading in his second goal in two starts since a January deadline-day switch from Lokomotiv Moscow.\n\nBack-to-back victories for Hull has allowed them to open up a four-point buffer on those in the relegation places and deliver a blow to QPR’s hopes of staying up. Yet it will be the below-the-belt one that will be remembered in years to come. “You can’t go punching people in the knackers, can you?” said Bruce."}, {"date": "21/02/2015", "arena": "Stadium of

and explore the “world’s biggest game reserve”.\n\nShould Sunderland fans accept this invitation their African hosts need have no fear about tourists from Wearside lacking the patience sometimes needed on safari. Spending interminable hours watching very little happen while hoping against hope for a moment of dramatic wonder has become second nature to followers of Gus Poyet’s team.\n\nDespite the home manager switching to a more attacking 4-4-2 formation – (although being Poyet he compensated by replacing his pacey attacking left back Patrick van Aanholt with the much more defensive minded Anthony Réveillère) – this latest home draw with an equally limited West Bromwich Albion proved entirely emblematic.\n\nIt was Sunderland’s eighth 0-0 of a campaign in which they have drawn 14 times. Only two Premier League games have been won at the Stadium of Light where a mere 12 League goals have been scored. Small wonder they persistently occupy the final slot on Match of the Day.\n\nIn mitigation this was a much less negative performance than many of late, with Sunderland defending higher up the pitch than usual and taking a few attacking gambles. The downside was the absence of the creativity needed to capitalise on this new spirit of moderate adventure.\n\nRoy Hodgson must certainly have questioned the wisdom of his decision to make a trip to the north-east. The England coach was here to watch West Brom’s Saido Berahino but, after sustaining an early knock, the forward experienced an off day. “Saido’s had better games,” said Tony Pulis, with considerable understatement.\n\nAlong with his team-mates, Berahino will have discovered that, for all their flaws, Poyet’s side are hard to beat. “I think we should take positives, me included,” said Sunderland’s manager. “We took risks. We needed a lucky break but it wasn’t to be.”\n\nNoteworthy incidents were strictly rationed. Early on Sunderland appealed, forlornly, for Joleon Lescott to be sent off after the centre-half tugged Danny Graham back as he accelerated into the area. Arguing that it was a denial of a clear-cut scoring opportunity and that Lescott was the last defender, Poyet’s players implored Mike Jones to produce his red card. Instead the referee showed a yellow. “I’ve seen old women on the high street take more of a knock than that and stay on their feet,” said Pulis.\n\nAlthough both sides produced the odd promising buildup, they were consistently let down by either slapdash or downright unimaginative final balls and the first real goalmouth excitement did not arrive until the end of the first half.\n\nVirtually Ben Foster’s first significant act was to pick the ball out of his net but Adam Johnson’s “goal” was disallowed for a slightly contentious offside. Tellingly, the 45th minute had arrived before the first legitimate shot on target was registered, with Foster diverting Sebastian Larsson’s swerving effort and the second period unravelled in markedly similar manner. Chances from open play were almost nonexistent.\n\n“We played well for 20 minutes,” said Pulis. “Then we really went off the boil, we just fell away – but we defended resolutely. The important thing is that, despite playing as poorly as we did, we’ve still got something from the game.”"}, {"date": "21/02/2015", "arena": "The Liberty Stadium", "attendance": 20809, "home_team": {"name": "Swansea City", "lineup": [{"name": "Lukasz Fabianski", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Naughton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Federico Fernandez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Williams", "yellows": [88], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Neil Taylor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sung-Yueng Ki", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [30], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Cork", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gylfi Sigurdsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [74]}, {"name": "Jonjo Shelvey", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Wayne Routledge", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bafétimbi Gomis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [73], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Jordi Amat", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leon Britton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marvin Emnes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nélson Oliveira", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jefferson Montero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [74], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Angel Rangel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gerhard Tremmel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Manchester United", "lineup": [{"name": "David De Gea", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paddy McNair", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Phil Jones", "yellows": [48], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marcos Rojo", "yellows": [88], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Luke Shaw", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [58]}, {"name": "Daley Blind", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ander Herrera", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [28], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ángel di María", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [79]}, {"name": "Marouane Fellaini", "yellows": [45], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robin van Persie", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wayne Rooney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Juan Mata", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [79], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Falcao", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adnan Januzaj", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Smalling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Young", "yellows": [84], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [58], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Antonio Valencia", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Valdes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Statistics insist that Manchester United are the best team in the Premier League on recent form but the table does not lie and fourth place is about right on this evidence.

They were fortunate, too, when Wayne Routledge, from a good position, fired his shot straight at David de Gea.\n\nUnited, less cohesive, could muster only a weak, mis-hit shot at close range from Wayne Rooney and a Robin van Persie drive which was well wide. Second best, it came as a surprise when they opened the scoring in the 28th minute, when Herrera’s strike was deflected in by Swansea defender Ashley Williams’s reaching left foot. The Swans, with Jack Cork, their recent signing from Southampton, a major influence in midfield, were deservedly level within two minutes, Shelvey’s cross from the left turned in by Ki for the Korean midfielder’s fifth goal of the season.\n\nKi was back again early in the second half, demanding a decent save from De Gea at whites-of-the-eyes range, but it was now that United took control for a spell. The catalyst was Van Gaal’s bold decision to replace both his full-backs with wingers. Antonio Valencia took over from Paddy McNair on the right while on the left Luke Shaw gave way to Ashley Young. It was like-for-like in positional terms, with Valencia and Young stationed either side of the back four, but the substitutes’ attacking contribution on the overlap was much greater and United were on top from half-time until the 72nd minute, when the Swans then took the lead with a goal out of nothing.\n\nShelvey, back to his bristling best, let fly at maximum velocity from the inside right channel and the ball deflected past De Gea via Gomis, who appeared to be intent on getting out of the way. United pressed with ever-increasing urgency but the accuracy of a blunderbuss and Wales’s standard bearers held on to their lead without real difficulty to record the double over their distinguished opponents for the first time.\n\nAt his press debriefing afterwards Van Gaal looked as if something disgusting was lodged under his nose. It may well have been sour grapes, given his insistence that United were superior and should have won.\n\nCrystal Palace 1-2 Arsenal | Premier League match report Read more\n\n“It’s amazing that we have lost today,” he said grumpily. “It is always frustrating to lose when you have been the dominating team and our disappointment is much bigger because of that. We lost through not scoring goals from so many chances. In the first half it was an equal game. In the second half there was a big difference. Swansea had a chance in the first minute and after that we dominated the game. We created a chance every two minutes but we were not effective. Then one counter, a shot deviated and [Gomis] may have been offside and they had a goal. So we are not happy and we are not lucky.\n\n“Nevertheless, we dominated the game, even with 10 men when Robin van Persie was injured and could not run any more.” The striker’s fitness will be a concern for Van Gaal, as he left the Liberty Stadium on crutches.\n\nGarry Monk’s assessment was much nearer the mark. Told that Van Gaal had claimed United deserved to win, the Swansea manager said: “I wouldn’t say that. Yes, we had to withstand some pressure in the second half, but it amounted to one shot on goal. We got the second goal, which we deserved, and could have had a third with the breakaways we had, so all in all it was a very pleasing performance. “\n\nMonk added that the winning goal would be credited to Gomis. “Jonjo has given it to him and Bafe deserved one today. He had one cleared off the line earlier and his work rate was excellent. I’m very pleased for him.\n\n“I thought we deserved the win and to be able to do the double over them for the first time in our history is something everyone connected with the club should be proud of.”"}, {"date": "21/02/2015", "arena": "Etihad Stadium", "attendance": 45602, "home_team": {"name": "Manchester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Joe Hart", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [],

difference in quality once their next opponents arrive at the Etihad, though that consideration apart the preparations for Tuesday’s crunch game against Barcelona could not have gone more swimmingly. Not only were City able to cut Chelsea’s lead to five points at the top of the Premier League, they boosted their confidence and goal difference with an easy home win while Barcelona were being beaten at Camp Nou by Manuel Pellegrini’s old team, Málaga.\n\nAdd the fact that Edin Dzeko not only scored his first goal for six months but looked thoroughly rejuvenated as the leader of the attacking line and City could hardly have asked for anything more. This game was supposed to be about Wilfried Bony but now there must be some doubt over whether the £25m striker will be an automatic selection against Barcelona after all.\n\nCity began with Bony on the bench, resisting the temptation to give their January signing an instant debut after the long wait for the Africa Cup of Nations to be over. Many had assumed he would go straight into the team, though having already upset Stevan Jovetic by registering Bony for Europe Pellegrini was probably wary of sending the wrong signal to Dzeko. The Bosnian has not scored for City since September but he was named up front with Sergio Agüero as City attempted to capitalise on Chelsea’s home draw against Burnley. “We were only thinking about Newcastle, not Barcelona,” Dzeko said. “We heard the Chelsea result just before kick-off so we knew we had a job to do and we did it well.”\n\nChelsea 1-1 Burnley | Premier League match report Read more\n\nThe strike partnership was in business as soon as the first minute thanks to some early-stage doziness from Vurnon Anita. The game was 29 seconds old when the midfielder miscontrolled on the edge of his own area to allow Dzeko to steal in, then trundled into the City player in a clumsy attempt to rectify his mistake. Dzeko went down, Chris Foy pointed to the spot, a reasonable decision even though there had been little clear intent, and Agüero beat Tim Krul from the spot.\n\nThat was simply good fortune, though when Dzeko helped create a second 11 minutes later it began to look like Pellegrini had made a great decision.\n\nTaking a pass from David Silva who wanted a return, Dzeko held up the ball in the area and found the better-placed Samir Nasri instead. He took a clever first touch to create a shooting opportunity before rifling past the helpless Krul. Nasri, like Dzeko, was playing inspired football at times, proving that when you pay £25m for a new player you do not necessarily need him on the pitch to see a return. If City have upped their game since Bony’s arrival, Pellegrini can still claim that as a legitimate part of his overall management strategy.\n\nFor his next trick Dzeko popped up on the right wing, crossing from near the corner flag for Pablo Zabaleta to dummy and allow Agüero to shoot narrowly wide. It was an enterprising start from City with Newcastle putting little together in response apart from a sweetly struck shot from Daryl Janmaat that briefly had Joe Hart worried.\n\nIf Bony was not worried at that stage, he might have begun to wonder about his future role when Dzeko added a third goal in emphatic manner midway through the first half. Reading Silva’s diagonal ball forward much better than Fabricio Coloccini, Dzeko stole in behind the defender, expertly controlled the high ball on his chest and gave Krul no chance with a left-foot half-volley.\n\nSwansea City 2-1 Manchester United | Premier League match report Read more\n\nThe Newcastle fans had only just completed their 18th-minute applause for Jonás Gutiérrez and they were three goals down. “There’s only one Alan Pardew,” was the muted response.\n\n“We owe our fantastic supporters an apology,” John Carver said. “When you concede a penalty straight from the kick-off it’s really annoying. We were beaten by a better side but still we weren’t good enough. It wasn’t a good day but it’s how we deal with it that matters.”\n\nNewcastle opened the second half with a wonderful piece of skill to give their supporters some encouragement, Papiss Cissé bringing a notable reaction save from Hart with a left-foot volley after being skilfully picked out by Moussa Sissoko’s cross from the right.\n\nSadly for the Toon Army that was as good as it got, only spurring City to add two more goals in the space of a couple of minutes. Both were scored by Silva and owed a lot to Agüero who created the first with a crossfield sprint from halfway to set up Nasri, whose unselfish pass allowed Silva to stroke home from close to the penalty spot. More ball-watching by Newcastle defenders, Janmaat in particular, then allowed Agüero to be first to reach Yaya Touré’s hopeful prod forward, chesting the ball into Silva’s path for another crisp finish from the edge of the area.\n\nBony was introduced shortly after that, replacing Agüero rather than Dzeko with the match clearly won. Somewhat anticlimactically he did not do a great deal, shooting against Krul with his only real chance, but that should not take anything away from the home side’s overall performance.\n\nNewcastle were poor, it is true, and a rout such as this does not make City favourites against Barcelona, but it cannot do any harm. The visiting Spanish journalists must have been impressed, put it that way. If all the English reporters out at Camp Nou had been presented with a similar scoreline to write home about, City would never have heard the last of it.\n\n“This was an even better win than our last one at Stoke,” Pellegrini said, keeping his focus on the league and his feet on the ground. “Last season when we came from behind we always had games in hand. This season the title is going to be about which team drops most points in the run-in.”"}, {"date": "11/02/2015", "arena": "Stamford Bridge", "attendance": 41592, "home_team": {"name": "Chelsea", "lineup": [{"name": "Petr Cech", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Branislav Ivanovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kurt Zouma", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Terry", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "César Azpilicueta", "yellows": [15], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ramires", "yellows": [89], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nemanja Matic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Juan Cuadrado", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [70]}, {"name": "Willian", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [89], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Eden Hazard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Loïc Remy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [70]}], "subs": [{"name": "Filipe Luis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cesc Fàbregas", "yellows": [88], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [70], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathan Aké", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Didier Drogba", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [70], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Thibaut Courtois", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gary Cahill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ruben Loftus-Cheek", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Everton", "lineup": [{"name": "Tim Howard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Seamus Coleman", "yellows": [58], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Stones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Jagielka", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bryan Oviedo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Muhamed Besic", "yellows": [5], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Gareth Barry", "yellows": [24], "reds": [88], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Lennon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [74]}, {"name": "Ross Barkley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [74]}, {"name": "Steven Naismith", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Romelu Lukaku", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Joel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Darron Gibson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [74], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Arouna Kone", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin Mirallas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [74], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James McCarthy", "yellows": [89], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Luke Garbutt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Antolin Alcaraz", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Every season there are standout moments when everything falls into place for the team who will eventually finish at the top of the league. For Chelsea this seemed as if it could be one.\n\nThe clock was turning into its 90th minute when Willian let fly with his right boot. A seven-point lead was in danger of being whittled down to five and in the moments preceding the goal it was clear how the frustration had got the better of one of José Mourinho’s players.\n\nBranislav Ivanovic is likely to get a three-match ban for that loss of control when he grabbed the substitute James McCarthy by the neck, then rammed his head into his opponent, as the two sets of players argued over the challenge from Gareth Barry that brought the Everton player’s second yellow card to end his night prematurely.\n\nThe referee, Jon Moss, also booked McCarthy, Ramires and Cesc Fàbregas for their parts in the confrontation and both teams stand to face a separate FA charge for not controlling their players, but the most important detail came next.\n\nFàbregas aimed the free-kick into the penalty area and it was Ivanovic who headed it on. Tim Howard punched the ball clear but Willian was lurking 20 yards from goal. His shot was struck with power, from the outside of his boot, but it was the deflection off Steven Naismith that helped it into the bottom corner and had Mourinho talking of a “beautiful” win.\n\nThe relief was considerable because Chelsea might have been behind at that stage but for a sensational save from Petr Cech to prevent Romelu Lukaku scoring against his former club midway through the second half. Everton had defended diligently, with John Stones excelling in front of the England manager, Roy Hodgson.\n\nHoward had produced a series of fine saves and, however stroppy Mourinho was when it came to answering questions about Ivanovic, nobody should think it particularly spoiled his mood.\n\n“I don’t remember a team to be champions without a couple of victories in the last minute,” he said. “In my case every time I won the league title I had a couple of matches where we won in the last minute. This was the first time this season.”\n\nIt was a breathless finale that also featured Nemanja Matic, the game’s outstanding performer, slashing the ball past Howard in the 86th minute only for his celebrations to be cut short because it had taken a deflection off Ivanovic, in an offside position, on the way to goal.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Chelsea’s José Mourinho avoids questions on Branislav Ivanović - video\n\nChelsea’s manager was even moved to describe it afterwards as being “fantastically well disallowed”, though his praise for the referee went only so far. Barry, he said, should have been sent off in the first half.\n\nMourinho being Mourinho, the oddity was that he forgot to mention it might have been a much more straightforward night if the referee had seen Naismith use an arm to lever the ball away from Juan Cuadrado inside the penalty area, with only four minutes gone.\n\nBy now Mourinho’s issue with the Premier League’s referees and what he perceives to be a “campaign” against his club is familiar. He goes too far, undoubtedly, but this was one of the more justifiable grievances to go into his increasingly thick file of complaints.\n\nCuadrado slipped in seamlessly on his first full start, interchanging positions with Willian, and was full of quick, direct running. Yet there were also times when Chelsea missed Diego Costa, serving the final game of his three-match suspension, and Everton actually had the best chance of the first half when Aaron Lennon and Ross Barkley combined to set up Lukaku.\n\nMourinho had left out Thibaut Courtois because he had seen signs of fatigue in the last two matches. Cech is a remarkable man to have in reserve and reminded everyone why his manager still regards him among the top three goalkeepers in the business.\n\nIt was certainly a brilliant reflex save to turn Lukaku’s later chance over the bar, from almost point-blank range, after Bryan Oviedo’s low cross had picked out the former Chelsea striker. Lukaku will feel he ought to have scored but Cech deserves the acclaim and must have played his way into Mourinho’s thoughts for the Champions league tie against Paris St-Germain next Tuesday.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Chelsea 1-0 Everton: Roberto Martínez hails team despite defeat – video\n\nOn the balance of play the victory was deserved, yet it also seemed harsh on Everton. Too often this season Roberto Martínez’s team have been undermined by their defending.\n\nPhil Jagielka played here more like the assured competitor of old and Stones’ performance was epitomised by one of the game’s outstanding moments to take the ball off Loïc Rémy with a sliding tackle. Higher up the pitch, there was also an assured performance from Barkley.\n\nChelsea, however, had most of the second-half momentum. After the hour there was a burst of pressure that involved Howard making as many saves in the space of five minutes as he had done throughout the entire match to that point.\n\nThe American, playing his first game since Boxing Day, showed in those moments why Martínez had brought him straight back into the team at the expense of Joel Robles. He was finally beaten by a deflection and the point was not lost on Martínez that Ivanovic played a part in the “hurtful” late goal."}, {"date": "11/02/2015", "arena": "Old Trafford", "attendance":

propelled his side to victory, though the centre-half was so shaky in defence it would have been a travesty. That seems to sum up Manchester United at the moment, nothing is going completely right, though at least they are back up to third after hanging on for a win against Burnley. And they were awarded their first penalty of the season, gleefully dispatched by the otherwise anonymous Robin van Persie. Louis van Gaal’s luck might be changing after all, though Sean Dyche keeps having to put a brave face on brave performances that earn scant reward.\n\n“It’s all you can expect at this level, you don’t get away with anything,” the Burnley manager said. “To come to Old Trafford and play on the front foot shows what we are about. We are not going anywhere to defend.”\n\nVan Gaal stuck to the same system that won a point at West Ham but adjusted his midfield diamond slightly, moving Adnan Januzaj further forward to the tip to allow Ángel Di María to operate on the left. Within a couple of minutes the United manager was having to make another change and his latest substitution worked out even more sweetly than the much-debated deployment of Marouane Fellaini as target man at Upton Park.\n\nPlaying in a truly hideous away strip that looked like Bacofoil and could even have been a tribute to Fifty Shades of Grey, Burnley won an early corner and Phil Jones injured himself in preventing Michael Keane scoring at the near post. Chris Smalling came on in his place and had been on the pitch a mere 22 seconds when he scored with his first touch, using his height on the six-yard line to place a header beyond Tom Heaton after Radamel Falcao had knocked a corner back across goal.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Louis van Gaal says Manchester United have played well and have improved their game\n\nUnited could hardly have asked for a better start yet six minutes later Burnley pegged them back. Michael Kightly had already had a shot saved by David de Gea by the time Kieran Trippier was sent racing down the right, neither Marcos Rojo nor Di María cut out the danger and an inviting cross was confidently headed in by a diving Danny Ings, scandalously unmarked in front of goal. United’s first half got worse but more fortunate after that, with Ings missing a close-range opportunity following a corner and Ashley Barnes sending a shot narrowly wide from the edge of the area.\n\nThe reason the home defence was under so much pressure was that the ball was not being retained in midfield, let alone used well, with the result that Falcao and Van Persie were again little more than spectators and Burnley were setting up most of the attacks. When Daley Blind could not continue and Ander Herrera was sent on to deputise, it at least gave Old Trafford supporters a rare sight of a player many feel may be the solution to this problem, though with Wayne Rooney dropping even deeper there was little immediate effect. Ings continued to look the classiest player on the pitch, certainly the most confident. “We only cost three quid,” the Burnley fans were chorusing before Smalling scored again on the stroke of the interval, lightening the half-time mood with a header from a position similar to his first, following a clever short corner routine between Rooney and Di María.\n\nBurnley missed an opportunity to equalise right at the start of the second half when Ings could only shoot at De Gea after Smalling had turned an innocuous George Boyd cross into an open invitation to score.\n\nSmalling and his side did get better as the second half progressed, without seriously troubling Heaton until the late penalty that settled the contest.\n\nHerrera’s first-time pass sent Di María into space down the left, Scott Arfield mistimed his tackle and Van Persie scored to leave United comfortable winners. While there was still time for Di María to have a shot saved and Januzaj an effort cleared off the line before the end, further goals would have flattered United’s overall performance. “Burnley were the better team in the first half,” Van Gaal conceded. “We were a little better in the second half but not much. We must forget this performance now. If we play like that in the next game we will be out of the FA Cup.”"}, {"date": "11/02/2015", "arena": " Mary's Stadium", "attendance": 31241, "home_team": {"name": "Southampton", "lineup": [{"name": "Fraser Forster", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathaniel Clyne", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "José Fonte", "yellows": [42], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Florin Gardos", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Maya Yoshida", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harrison Reed", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [67]}, {"name": "Victor Wanyama", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Davis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sadio Mané", "yellows": [39], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [81]}, {"name": "Graziano Pellè", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eljero Elia", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [63]}], "subs": [{"name": "Kelvin Davis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dusan Tadic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [63], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Filip Djuricic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [81], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Ward-Prowse", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [67], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jason McCarthy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jake Flannigan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "West Ham United", "lineup": [{"name": "Adrián", "yellows": [], "reds": [61], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Carl Jenkinson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cheikhou Kouyaté", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Tomkins", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Cresswell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Morgan Amalfitano", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex Song", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stewart Downing", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Diafra Sakho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [55]}, {"name": "Carlton Cole", "yellows": [50], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [63]}, {"name": "Enner Valencia", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}], "subs": [{"name": "Matthew Jarvis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andy Carroll", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [55], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joey O'Brien", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jussi Jaaskelainen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [63], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Reece Burke", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Reece Oxford", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Elliot Lee", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "It may not have been very sophisticated, but Sam Allardyce will care little. West Ham fought for a valuable point here in a game that will be forgotten in a hurry, a dull goalless draw that only came to life once the Hammers’ goalkeeper, Adrián, was sent off in the second half for handling the ball outside the area.\n\nThe night ended, though, with Andy Carroll departing St Mary’s on crutches with a recurrence of his knee injury, another setback for the striker who had come on as a second-half substitute and is set to be unavailable for at least two and a half weeks.\n\nAdrián’s sending off should have been the turning point in an otherwise uneventful contest, but from the 61st minute onwards West Ham had everyone bar Carroll behind the ball. In the end you had to admire their discipline, creating an insurmountable blue wall that Southampton were unable to penetrate.\n\nIt was a missed opportunity for Ronald Koeman’s side, who had few clear chances as they slipped behind Manchester United in the Premier League table. The Saints were often guilty of overelaborating in attack and Koeman admitted afterwards that those players who were so potent earlier in the campaign are not quite firing on all fronts.\n\nAdrián was sent off by the referee, Craig Pawson, in controversial and clumsy circumstances. The Spanish goalkeeper received the ball on the penalty spot and instead of clearing, attempted to drop his shoulder and turn past Sadio Mané. The Senegal international read the dummy and got his body in between the ball and the despairing keeper, who proceeded to handle outside the area as he tumbled to the turf inside the D.\n\nHowever, Mané did appear to raise his arms when attempting to put himself between Adrián and the ball, with Allardyce stating afterwards that West Ham would appeal against the red card. “It was a foul on our goalkeeper before he handballs it. There’s no doubt Sadio Mané’s got his hands all over Adrián and we’ve had to cope with that sending off. I suggest that [the head of referees] Mike Riley does something that I can’t suggest publicly. We will appeal, immediately. I’ll be very disappointed if we don’t get off.”\n\nOn Carroll’s knee injury, the West Ham manager added: “It’s the same knee, he got kicked in the back of the knee and felt something wrong. He stayed up and was a nuisance. I just hope that staying on hasn’t done any more damage. He got fit in two and a half weeks [after the Liverpool game] but clearly it’s going to take longer this time because it’s the same injury.”\n\nMané was Saints’ best player and it was his jinking run into the area following a smart backheel after 13 minutes that resulted in their best early chance. Mané looked to have overrun it but beat his man before squeezing the ball across goal into the path of Eljero Elia, but Carl Jenkinson was well-placed at the far post to hack clear. Again Mané was the danger man, in the 54th minute, and slid a ball inside to Graziano Pellè, but the striker duffed his shot which looped into the arms of Adrián. West Ham countered through the half-time substitute Matt Jarvis – soon joined by Carroll from the bench – and he pulled back for Stewart Downing on the edge of the area, but his effort deflected wide.\n\nCarlton Cole was perhaps fortunate not to receive more than a yellow card for a high boot on the Southampton left-back, Maya Yoshida, and it proved to be his last act of the evening. He was replaced by Jussi Jaaskelainen following the red card, an incident as calamitous as it was avoidable.\n\nFor Southampton there were too many missed passes, too many bad decisions in the opposition penalty area, and in the end Jaaskelainen only had to make one real save, to deny Dusan Tadic with a stinging drive. Koeman said: “If you are the better team, with more possession, more chances and you play around 25 minutes, 11 against 10 then you expect to score. We didn’t. If you play a game like tonight, a long time 11 versus 10, in my opinion you have to score. At least you have to create more.”"}, {"date": "11/02/2015", "arena": "Bet365 Stadium", "attendance": 27011, "home_team": {"name": "Stoke City", "lineup": [{"name": "Asmir Begovic", "yellows": [],

the champions wobbled until pulling away when the underrated James Milner scored 10 minutes into the second half.\n\nCity knew they must win to ensure no further ground was ceded to Chelsea. And with the leaders defeating Everton the champions closed the evening having maintained a deficit of seven points to at least let José Mourinho’s men know the title race is not yet a formality.\n\nOn the same day of last season City had notched 21 goals more than the 47 accrued in the Premier League before the start of this game. While they had played one match more then than the current term’s 24, this striking deficit offered a big clue as to why Manuel Pellegrini’s men are struggling.\n\nAn embodiment of this was shown early on. David Silva was clear and squared the ball to Sergio Agüero. The striker scuffed the shot and missed a chance to break a drought that stretched back to 3 December when the last two of his 19 strikes were registered.\n\nHaving turned the champions over 1-0 at the Etihad in the reverse league fixture, Stoke had no doubt they could repeat the feat tonight. Mark Hughes could hardly wait to mention how the club would be “gunning for our first double” in his pre-game notes, shoehorning this into the opening paragraph and the way his side pinned City back suggested this might be a matter of time only.\n\nJoe Hart had one of those moments he seems capable of, spilling a fierce Victor Moses shot nearly straight into his goal. Instead it went for a corner and from this Peter Crouch had a free header and Stoke appeared to have a good shout for a penalty as James Milner’s arm connected with the ball.\n\nIf Lee Mason, the referee, was unsure, it was clearer still how City were continuing the poor form of Saturday’s draw with Hull City. Throughout this patchy period the visiting support sang, “We know what we are, we’re the champions of England” and, finally, their team performed like so.\n\nAgüero cast off the doubt that was hampering him when he took possession near Stoke’s goal. With a shoulder-drop the striker made space, then drilled a sweet finish beyond Asmir Begovic.\n\nThis felt unfair to Stoke and justice was about to be served. Marko Arnautovic, the classy Austrian playmaker Hughes deploys on the right, swung in a menacing cross and Crouch again could head unmarked, this time to beat Hart.\n\nCity had the look of an outfit fighting a relegation battle, not defending the Premier League crown. On the stroke of half-time Agüero might have had a second with a finish into the open goal but his hand touched the ball, the strike was disallowed, and the 26-year-old was booked.\n\nIt summed City up so far. Fernandinho offered flashes of quality in the opening 45 minutes and another came at the second half’s start. The Brazilian’s clever pass split Stoke and allowed Kolarov to run at Begovic, but there was no finish. The problem was Fernandinho followed this with a clumsy ball that handed possession to Stoke in midfield to again illustrate City’s hesitancy. There was the sense that a match they had to win might slip away.\n\nBut Milner, the saviour with the late equaliser against Hull, stepped up.

And, in such context, it was entirely fitting that the Crystal Palace manager should enjoy one of those moments that men in his position dream about.\n\nThe contest had been billed as an early opportunity for him to taste a bit of vindication for his decision to leave Newcastle United, his previous employer of four years, for a return to Palace early last month. The passions swirled inside him and there were choice chants from the visiting fans.\n\nThe match was drifting away from Pardew. Newcastle created very little but, when they sprang forward just before the interval, Papiss Cissé showed his dead-eyed instincts to head home his 10th goal of the Premier League season. “That is Papiss, he doesn’t need a high ratio of chances,” Pardew said.\n\nBut Pardew watched things turn when he summoned Yannick Bolasie from the bench. The DR Congo winger was only just back from the Africa Cup of Nations and this was his first action for Palace since New Year’s Day.\n\nIt took him three minutes to have his say. His cross from the right was marked by pace and precision and another substitute, Fraizer Campbell, slid in to guide home the equaliser. Pardew’s celebrations were suitably frenzied.\n\nFrom that moment only one team looked like nicking the points. It had been blood-and-thunder fare – heavy on commitment and low on quality – but Palace had the bit between their teeth and they pushed hard.\n\nBolasie almost laid on the winner. From another cross from the right the ball was flicked on and there was Wilfried Zaha with the chance to shoot. He delayed for a split-second, though, and Daryl Janmaat blocked. There was more. Towards the very end Brede Hangeland rose to meet a corner only for Tim Krul to plunge low and repel the header. Pardew could not bend the script entirely to his will.\n\n“It was a big point,” Pardew said. “Points are gold dust in the Premier League, so I am pleased. I was very pleased with our reaction in the second half. But really it was the bench that salvaged the game for us. Yannick’s cross was of the highest order and he had no right to put in a ball of that quality from the room he had. I thought there would only be one winner at that point but we could not quite get a second goal. Tim Krul’s save from Brede was world-class.”\n\nJohn Carver, the Newcastle manager, said his players had complained about the state of the recently relaid Selhurst Park pitch after the warm-up. “It was quite lively and I knew we weren’t going to be able to get it down and pass it,” he said.\n\nIt was an intensely physical encounter, with Zaha’s early trick to bamboozle Remy Cabella standing out like a beacon. Palace sought to make capital on set pieces that they whipped or dropped into a crowded penalty area and it looked as if they intended to bludgeon their way to some kind of result.\n\nThey lost Yaya Sanogo to an injury and Campbell, his replacement, then headed home from Jason Puncheon’s cross on 36 minutes, only to be correctly pulled back – correctly – for offside.\n\nThe first half featured one chance and Newcastle created it took it. Moussa Sissoko worked the ball wide to Janmaat and he outpaced Zaha before crossing on the run. The delivery was excellent and, after Damien Delaney had mis-read the flight and failed to head clear, Cissé headed firmly into the near corner. A coin was thrown from the crowd at the celebrating Newcastle players and Carver said it had narrowly missed the captain Fabricio Coloccini’s eye.\n\nBolasie’s introduction was decisive and Carver’s decision to bring on the defender, Paul Dummett, for Cabella late on was prompted by Bolasie’s presence. “I know all about Yannick Bolasie because I worked with him every single day at Plymouth Argyle,” Carver said. “I was concerned that he would make another goal and we would lose, so I had to do something about it. Sometimes you have to take off your flair players to get something out of the game.”"}, {"date": "11/02/2015", "arena": "The Hawthorns", "attendance": 23516, "home_team": {"name": "West Bromwich Albion", "lineup": [{"name": "Ben Foster", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Craig Dawson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gareth McAuley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joleon Lescott", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Brunt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Claudio Yacob", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Darren Fletcher", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Morrison", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [85]}, {"name": "Saido Berahino", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [74], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Callum McManaman", "yellows": [23], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [57]}, {"name": "Brown Ideye", "yellows": [41], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [60], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Andre Wisdom", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonas Olsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Baird", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Craig Gardner", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [85], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Boaz Myhill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sébastien Pocognoli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stéphane Sessegnon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [57], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Swansea City", "lineup": [{"name": "Lukasz Fabianski", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Naughton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Federico Fernandez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Williams", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Neil Taylor", "yellows": [34], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Cork", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sung-Yueng Ki", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathan Dyer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [63]}, {"name": "Jonjo Shelvey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [62]}, {"name": "Jefferson Montero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bafétimbi Gomis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Jordi Amat", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Carroll", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wayne Routledge", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [63], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nélson Oliveira", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [62], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Angel Rangel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gerhard Tremmel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jay Fulton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "The Qatari transfer window closes next Wednesday but it is safe to say that Brown Ideye will not be getting on a plane to the Middle East anytime soon. After pulling the plug on the Nigerian’s £3.8m transfer to Al Gharafa on deadline day, after a deal for Carlton Cole collapsed at the 11th hour, West Bromwich Albion have been rewarded with two goals in as many games from the club-record signing who was previously a figure of ridicule.\n\nIt is some turnaround for Ideye and on the evidence of this crucial victory over a desperately disappointing Swansea side, there are the makings of a promising partnership with Saido Berahino.\n\nIdeye opened the scoring after being set up by Berahino and the roles were reversed 14 minutes later when Albion’s top scorer dispatched a splendid first-time shot inside the near post to take his tally for the season to 15 and in the process, lift Albion to 14th in the table.\n\nMuch more of this and Tony Pulis, Albion’s head coach, will start to think that it was a blessing that West Ham refused to allow Cole to leave Upton Park. “Brown’s a lovely lad,” the Albion manager said. “He works hard, he’s a good professional but he had a bad time here before I took over. In today’s world there is no patience. People expect, expect and expect. And if the person doesn’t match that expectation they moan like drains. We’ve played him a few times and we’re happy that he stayed and delighted he got us a couple of goals.”\n\nIdeye, who scored the equaliser in the 2-2 draw at Burnley on Sunday, looked lively throughout and there were signs that the £10m Albion paid Dynamo Kyiv for him last summer is no longer weighing so heavily. “He’s come here with a big fee on his head, there’s great expectations from the fans and he’s had to deal with that,” Dave Kemp, Pulis’s assistant added. “But he’s got himself into the team now and he’s playing well. We’re pleased he scored and he also had a very good game. He had an impact for 90 minutes.”\n\nAs well as Albion played at times in the second half, there was no escaping just how poor Swansea were. Bafetimbi Gomis made little impression up front, the midfield never imposed themselves and there was a vulnerability in defence that the home side exposed.\n\nGarry Monk, the Swansea manager, made no attempt to conceal his frustration. “The first half was pretty even but I think all night we didn’t play with any tempo or intensity – the most disappointing bit is I spoke about that before the game. Albion deserved the win, I have no complaints. You can’t turn up to a Premier League game without that intensity, crispness of passing, and expect to get anything.”\n\nChris Brunt may well have been lucky not to be penalised in the buildup to Albion’s first goal but Monk refused to made much of that incident. “It was a foul. I didn’t think the referee had control of the game the whole night. He didn’t seem to really know what he was doing at times. But that’s not an excuse, that’s not to do with why we lost the game. As a team tonight we didn’t perform at all.”\n\nAfter a first half of few chances – a glancing header from Craig Dawson that was repelled by Lukasz Fabianski was about as a good as it got – the game came to life on the hour mark. Stéphane Sessègnon, on for the injured Callum McManaman, cut inside to release Berahino in the inside-left channel. Berahino moved the ball on to Ideye and after Ashley Williams managed to partially block his first attempt, the striker hooked a low shot into the far corner.\n\nThe game was effectively over when Albion struck again. Jefferson Montero lost possession midway inside his own half and Berahino, after exchanging passes with Ideye on the edge of the Swansea area, finished with a flourish."}, {"date": "10/02/2015", "arena": "Emirates Stadium", "attendance": 60032, "home_team": {"name": "Arsenal", "lineup": [{"name": "David Ospina", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Hector Bellerin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Per Mertesacker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Laurent Koscielny", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [27], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nacho Monreal", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tomas Rosicky", "yellows": [67], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Francis Coquelin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Santi Cazorla", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Theo Walcott", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [41], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [73]}, {"name": "Alexis Sánchez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [68]}, {"name": "Mesut Özil", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Wojciech Szczesny", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kieran Gibbs", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gabriel Paulista", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Olivier Giroud", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [68], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Ramsey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [73], "sub_off": [82]}, {"name": "Mathieu Flamini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [82], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Welbeck", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Leicester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Mark Schwarzer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Simpson", "yellows": [89], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wes Morgan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [81]}, {"name": "Robert Huth", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matthew Upson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [59]}, {"name": "Paul Konchesky", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Riyad Mahrez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matthew James", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Esteban Cambiasso", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jeffrey Schlupp", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [86]}, {"name": "Andrej Kramaric", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [61], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Danny Drinkwater", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andy King", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marc Albrighton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Hamer", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leonardo Ulloa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [81], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marcin Wasilewski", "yellows": [65], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [59], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Nugent", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [86], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Nigel Pearson says that he can look after himself and so, on this evidence, can his Leicester City team. Two goals down despite having made a decent fist of the first half, they staged a stirring comeback and, when they departed north London, could not fathom how they had done so empty-handed. Arsène Wenger dwelled for a moment when he shook hands with Pearson afterwards. “I told him that we had been a bit lucky,” Wenger said.\n\nAndrej Kramaric scored his first goal for Leicester since his £9m January arrival from Rijeka but it was the ones that got away for him and his team-mates that provided the bitter after-taste for Pearson. He spoke about his pride in the performance but he admitted that the hard-luck schtick was wearing thin. Leicester remain at the foot of the Premier League table.\n\nIt said everything that Arsenal were grateful for the final whistle, the Emirates Stadium crowd having been reduced to living on their nerves as Leicester advertised what would have been a deserved equaliser. The excellent Riyad Mahrez curled inches wide on 72 minutes while Kramaric’s chip, when one-on-one with David Ospina on 79 minutes, did not have enough on it. Ospina clutched the ball gratefully.\n\nIt was a curious evening for Arsenal. They got the result which went some way to getting them back on track after Saturday’s derby defeat at Tottenham Hotspur and they climbed to fourth in the division. But Wenger could lament the loss of “cohesion and technical superiority,” in the second half, together with injury concerns for Alexis Sánchez and Aaron Ramsey.\n\nSánchez absorbed what Wenger described as a “heavy” tackle from Matt hew Upson in the 29th minute only to play on. He was eventually forced off on 68 minutes. The Chilean, who played as the central striker, was back from a hamstring injury and he tweeted afterwards that “sometimes the love for the game and anxiety to be on a football pitch works against you.” After a largely peripheral display, he seemed to be suggesting that he had come back too soon.\n\nRamsey’s injury felt more ominous. He departed nine minutes after coming on as a substitute, feeling his hamstring as he went, and Wenger spoke with pessimism about the situation. It was the third time this season that the midfielder had damaged the muscle.\n\n“It doesn’t look good when a guy stops straight away and sits down,” Wenger said. “I left him out [of the starting lineup] to be cautious with him. I put him on and it was not the best of decisions. I can’t say it’s not a worry because after a while, the player cannot play with a free mind. He’s not over-played. I don’t know why this is.\n\n“Sánchez was not himself. He got a knock to the knee and was never comfortable. I wanted to take him off at half-time but he said he was OK to go on. Sometimes, it’s just a kick and you can run it off. But it became worse.”\n\nPearson has been at the centre of a storm since his clash with Crystal Palace’s James McArthur on Saturday, when he placed his hands on the midfielder’s throat and there was the subsequent farce over whether he had been sacked or not on Sunday. But this was a performance that brought him respite.\n\nLeicester had started well, with Esteban Cambiasso twice releasing Mahrez, whose shots deflected off target, while Mahrez worked his way through on 39 minutes to curl narrowly off target. Per Mertesacker also extended a long leg to deny Jeff Schlupp following a Paul Konchesky cross.\n\nBut Arsenal took their chances in the first half and they looked to be comfortable. Laurent Koscielny gave Wes Morgan the slip to sweep home from Mesut Özil’s corner while Theo Walcott belted home after Özil’s shot from distance had been parried by Mark Schwarzer. The Leicester goalkeeper also made good saves to deny Walcott and Özil in the first half.\n\nPearson had switched to a 5-4-1 formation and he watched from the stands for most of the first half. But he was in the dugout for the second period and he had a close-up view of his team’s fightback.\n\nKramaric grew into the game and he drew a wonderful save out of Ospina and then watched Mertesacker head his follow-up chip clear. Leicester were back into it moments later. Arsenal appealed for handball against Cambiasso but when he popped the ball back to Mahrez, his cross was headed out by Koscielny but only as far as Kramaric. He blasted low through the crowded area. By the end, there was the sense that Arsenal were hanging on.

City clambered out of the relegation zone and consigned Paul Lambert to a half-century of Premier League defeats as Aston Villa manager in the process.\n\nThis was Lambert’s 101st match and few will have been flatter as his side were sucked into the bottom three by a team winning for only the third time in 18 attempts themselves. Only Mick McCarthy, with Sunderland, has tasted more reverses in bringing up a century.\n\nHull handed a first start to their one January addition, Dame N’Doye, the £3m purchase from Lokomotiv Moscow, in their attempt to improve the Premier League’s poorest home record. The Senegal international made a good first impression, bringing the best out of Nikica Jelavic, who was recalled after a knee injury.\n\nAston Villa fans turn up the heat on defiant Paul Lambert after latest defeat Read more\n\nIndeed, it was the pair’s link-up that led to Steve Bruce’s side taking the lead midway through the opening period. Running at the visiting defence, N’Doye produced a cunning disguise pass that the Croat Jelavic took in his stride and dispatched past Brad Guzan via a looping deflection.\n\nThe portents for victory appeared good given the Croat’s record – he found the net in each of Hull’s past three victories – combined with Villa’s impotence away from home. Although they halted the Premier League’s fourth longest goal drought when Jores Okore broke a sequence which spanned a minute shy of 11 hours against Chelsea at the weekend, the visitors had not scored away from Villa Park for seven.\n\nTheir first-half efforts here all lacked direction, as was the case when their impish Spanish midfielder Carles Gil dragged wide just before Hull’s opening goal and when Ashley Westwood clipped a 36th-minute free-kick over the wall, or power on the only occasion they did manage an effort on target when Allan McGregor saved a tepid glancing header from Gabby Agbonlahor.\n\nHull were not much better, although N’Doye did add menace to their attacking forays. As early as the fourth minute, he followed an intelligent lay-off in the buildup by surging into the area to meet Ahmed Elmohamady’s cross, only to be beaten to the ball by Guzan’s fists.\n\nN’Doye turned provider 60 seconds later but his scoop over the top of the Hull defence was well read by Guzan, who rushed out of his area to hack clear with Jelavic bearing down on him.\n\nHull’s other two efforts before the interval both came from their new recruit. First when, with a dozen minutes on the clock, Hull dispossessed their opponents high up the pitch only for his shot from the edge of the area to be gathered comfortably by Guzan; then, immediately after Jelavic’s goal, when his header from Elmohamady’s cross sailed wide.\n\nVilla fielded a full debutant of their own in Scott Sinclair, whose berth on the left side of midfield meant Tom Cleverley was omitted when eligible for the first time since arriving from Manchester United in the summer. Trailing at the break, however, they reshaped for the second period with Christian Benteke adding beef to their central attack at the expense of the largely anonymous Andreas Weimann.\n\nThe Midlands club pressed in a bid at least to emulate the weekend achievements of Premier League champions Manchester City, who denied Hull a shock victory courtesy of James Milner’s 92nd-minute equaliser. Hull had failed to score in 12 of their previous 16 matches when David Meyler nudged them in front at the Etihad and once again they sat on a slender advantage.\n\nIt meant Villa dominated in both possession and territory while Hull appeared content to launch counterattacks. It was a tactic that almost reaped a return just shy of the hour when Jelavic was hauled down on the edge of the area by Agbonlahor. But Robbie Brady’s free-kick failed to locate a chink in Villa’s defensive wall and Jelavic mishit the rebound.\n\nWith Villa not seriously threatening any improvement to a woeful return of six goals in their last 20 Premier League road trips, Hull killed off the game for a rare win against their biggest bogey team. Typically, it was N’Doye whose debut effort ended a sequence of nine defeats and a draw when he forced home a loose ball from a 72nd-minute free-kick, after Guzan had blocked his initial effort at the base of his post. It was met by the unfurling of a “Lambert Out” banner in the away end and sighs of relief around the rest of the stadium."}, {"date": "10/02/2015", "arena": "Stadium of Light", "attendance": 39077, "home_team": {"name": "Sunderland", "lineup": [{"name": "Costel Pantilimon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Anthony Reveillere", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [63]}, {"name": "Santiago Vergini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John O'Shea", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Patrick van Aanholt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sebastian Larsson", "yellows": [41], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Liam Bridcutt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordi Gomez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Adam Johnson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jermain Defoe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Connor Wickham", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [82]}], "subs": [{"name": "Wes Brown", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [63], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Fletcher", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [82], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Graham", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ricky Álvarez", "yellows": [83], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sebastián Coates", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Vito Mannone", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Liam Agnew", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Queens Park Rangers", "lineup": [{"name": "Robert Green", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mauricio Isla", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [85]}, {"name": "Rio Ferdinand", "yellows": [70], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Caulker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Suk-Young Yun", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Karl Henry", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joey Barton", "yellows": [78], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matt Phillips", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [52]}, {"name": "Leroy Fer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [17], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [75]}, {"name": "Niko Kranjcar", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bobby Zamora", "yellows": [35], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [45], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Armand Traore", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Clint Hill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shaun Wright-Phillips", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [52], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex McCarthy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adel Taarabt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mauro Zárate", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [75], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Doughty", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [85], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Who needs Michael Laudrup or anyone else Tony Fernandes might have in mind as QPR’s next manager when Chris Ramsey is around? The visiting caretaker’s new coaching partnership with Kevin Bond appeared a potentially relegation-preventing formula as Harry Redknapp’s old team responded to a tactical revamp by collecting their first away points of the campaign.\n\nIt should be no surprise that the travelling hoodoo was broken on Wearside. Sunderland have won only two Premier League games here all season and were plunged straight back into a survival struggle. While Gus Poyet wallowed in despair, Ramsey was enjoying himself. “I thought I deserved the job before this,” he said with a smile. “But if it’s my last game in charge, it’s some way to go out.\n\n“I was working in the academy before so I didn’t watch all the first-team games but I’m sure this was not just down to my magic wand. It was about people playing to their potential. It was important to build points so we don’t get cut off from the other teams at the bottom.”\n\nBy making six changes and placing the emphasis on attack Ramsey petrified Sunderland to the point where they spent the first 20 minutes apparently frozen. As awful as they often are at home Poyet’s players can rarely have started a game as badly as this. For what seemed an eternity they struggled to retain the ball for more than a few seconds as QPR pressed them high up the pitch.\n\nWith Niko Kranjcar and Bobby Zamora both seeing shots deflected and Joey Barton – his every touch booed in true pantomime villain fashion – shutting down a totally ineffective Jordi Gómez, Ramsey’s bold new strategy was working a treat.\n\nA shocked 17th-minute silence engulfed the stadium as Matt Phillips escaped Liam Bridcutt and directed a deep cross in Leroy Fer’s direction. Operating as a second striker behind Bobby Zamora, Fer capitalised on slapdash marking to power a header beyond Costel Pantilimon. Across in the away technical area Ramsey and Bond looked almost stunned at seeing things going quite so swimmingly and appeared unsure quite how to react.\n\nGradually Sunderland fans rediscovered their voice. Harsh in tone, it alternated jeers and groans with some cuttingly caustic advice for Poyet’s players. With the home team badly missing the injured Lee Cattermole, QPR very nearly doubled their lead in the 29th minute. When Phillips cut the ball back, the excellent Fer unleashed a clever shot which struck the inside of a post and then rolled, tantalisingly, across the goalline before trickling to safety.\n\nYet awkward as his players were finding Phillips, Fer, Zamora and the dynamically disruptive Barton, they did enjoy the occasional moment in the attacking sun. The only trouble was that with Rio Ferdinand rolling back the years to subdue his old England team-mate Jermain Defoe, Robert Green found himself only really called to arms once in the opening half, making a wonderful save to deny Connor Wickham following Adam Johnson’s fine cross.\n\nPatrick van Aanholt missed a decent close-range chance but unfortunately for an increasingly miserable looking Poyet, Zamora was finding his range at the other end. When Santiago Vergini stood off him as the interval beckoned, the centre forward met yet another cross from Phillips and swivelled imperiously before beating Pantilimon with a fabulously executed half-volley.\n\nOn a night when the tendrils of mist beginning to swirl across the pitch matched the enduring lack of clarity in Sunderland’s play, the home side struggled to take advantage of the exhaustion which saw Phillips withdrawn and Shaun Wright-Phillips make his first Premier League appearance in two years.\n\nAlthough Green reacted well to deny Defoe and made another stellar save to repel Ricardo Álvarez’s capriciously swerving shot, Ferdinand and company defied increasing tiredness to hold firm. Indeed the only sour note for Ramsey was the sight of Fer being stretchered off with a potentially serious knee injury.\n\nPoyet was left to rue Sunderland’s slow start, not to mention the acres of space they had afforded Phillips. “I couldn’t understand it in such an important game,” he said. “I’m disappointed. It’s a massive missed opportunity. It’s happening too many times. We need to change.”"}, {"date": "10/02/2015", "arena": "Anfield", "attendance": 44577, "home_team": {"name": "Liverpool", "lineup": [{"name": "Simon Mignolet", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Emre Can", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Skrtel", "yellows": [40], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mamadou Sakho", "yellows": [45], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordon Ibe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordan Henderson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Gerrard", "yellows": [60], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [53], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [68]}, {"name": "Alberto Moreno", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lazar Markovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [15], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [79]}, {"name": "Philippe Coutinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daniel Sturridge", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [74]}], "subs": [{"name": "Glen Johnson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dejan Lovren", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [68], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rickie Lambert", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Lallana", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [79], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Allen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mario Balotelli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [83], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [74], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Ward", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Tottenham Hotspur", "lineup": [{"name": "Hugo Lloris", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Walker", "yellows": [73], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eric Dier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jan Vertonghen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Rose", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nabil Bentaleb", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Mason", "yellows": [24], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [69]}, {"name": "Erik Lamela", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mousa Dembélé", "yellows": [63], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [61], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [85]}, {"name": "Christian Eriksen", "yellows": [28], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [81]}, {"name": "Harry Kane", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [26], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Paulinho", "yellows": [88], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [69], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Roberto Soldado", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [85], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michel Vorm", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andros Townsend", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Federico Fazio", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nacer Chadli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [81], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Davies", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Mario Balotelli peeled off his gloves on the final whistle, ignored the jubilant Liverpool celebrations in the far corner of the pitch and headed straight down the tunnel as Colin Pascoe offered an embrace. No joy, no show of relief, not even a glimmer of satisfaction. Perhaps he simply forgot what a matchwinner is supposed to do.\n\nBalotelli produced his first Premier League goal in 13 appearances for Liverpool to seal a crucial late victory over Tottenham Hotspur, one that puts Brendan Rodgers’ side firmly in the hunt for Champions League qualification and stalled the momentum of their enterprising visitors.\n\nThere were seven minutes remaining when a fellow substitute, Adam Lallana, drove an inviting cross behind Jan Vertonghen and Balotelli ghosted in to convert beyond Hugo Lloris. Liverpool’s principal owner, John W Henry, and chairman Tom Werner were looking on from the Main Stand and the looming draw would have done little for their club’s top-four prospects. The Italy international has toiled badly since his £16m move from Milan but the late winner showed his sense of occasion remains intact.\n\n“I’m sure he’ll be smiling in the dressing room because he’s just won us the game,” offered Jordan Henderson, and Balotelli would later post a beaming photo of himself on Instagram. “He’s immensely happy,” claimed Pascoe, Liverpool’s assistant manager who took over post-match media duties with Rodgers catching a flight to Europe for club business.\n\nRodgers had spoken ominously on the eve of Spurs’ visit about what failure to take maximum points would mean for the remainder of Liverpool’s season. Raheem Sterling was sidelined with a foot injury suffered in the FA Cup replay at Bolton Wanderers, Lucas Leiva for the next four to six weeks with a thigh problem, and Spurs arrived buoyed by the derby win over Arsenal and with the confidence generated by only one defeat in 10 league games.\n\nBut Daniel Sturridge returned for his first league start since Liverpool’s 3-0 win at White Hart Lane in August and would influence another defeat for Mauricio Pochettino’s team, their fifth in succession in this fixture. The striker’s first two chances stemmed from wayward passes by Ryan Mason and Nabil Bentaleb as Tottenham’s carelessness in midfield supplied Liverpool’s attack consistently in the first half. Inevitable rustiness from Sturridge reprieved the visitors on those occasions.\n\nLazar Markovic volleyed over from close range and Lloris made an excellent save to deny Sturridge after Jordan Ibe combined with the Serb down the right. The Tottenham keeper’s next intervention was less impressive, however, as he and his defenders failed to deal with a routine clearance down the field from Simon Mignolet. Vertonghen’s unconvincing challenge on Sturridge rebounded kindly into the path of Markovic, Eric Dier dropped off for reasons best known to himself and the £20m summer signing from Benfica scuffed his shot beyond Lloris’s weak left hand and into the bottom corner.\n\nTottenham responded positively. Emre Can threw himself in the way of a Christian Eriksen shot and the Dane then combined neatly with Erik Lamela to create a 23rd goal of the season for Harry Kane. Liverpool failed to exert sufficient pressure on the Spurs’ pair outside the area, Mamadou Sakho slipped as Lamela played a disguised pass into the box and Kane was left free to drive in the equaliser between Mignolet’s legs.\n\nThe game continued to flow and Sturridge almost restored Liverpool’s advantage in nonchalant style when Ibe’s right-wing cross deflected into his path six yards out. The Liverpool striker was facing away from goal and surrounded by several white shirts but back-flicked the ball against the outside of a post.\n\nTottenham started the second half with purpose but it was Liverpool who regained the lead when Danny Rose was adjudged to have clipped Sturridge inside the area. Phil Dowd waved play on after the striker tumbled over the left-back’s outstretched leg only for his assistant to signal for a foul. Steven Gerrard converted the spot-kick just beyond Lloris’ finger-tips for his 10th goal of his farewell Liverpool season before being replaced with a slight hamstring problem.\n\nThere was further controversy when Spurs levelled for a second time. Gerrard was booked for a foul that wasn’t on Eriksen, who drew a fine save from Mignolet from the resulting free-kick, albeit with the ball dropping to Kane inside the area.\n\nKane squared – from an offside position, claimed Liverpool – and Mousa Dembélé was able to convert with his chest from close range.

If West Ham had sold Carlton Cole to West Bromwich Albion, Brown Ideye would not have provided them with a point at Turf Moor. It said much about the Nigerian’s disastrous debut campaign at The Hawthorns that Albion were willing to swallow a £6m loss to offload their record signing to the Qatari team, Al Gharafa.\n\nInstead a man who appeared to rival Mario Balotelli in the contest for the title of worst signing of the season remains on Albion’s books. Seven months after his arrival from Dynamo Kiev, the £10m striker has finally made a meaningful contribution to the club he could have left. His second league goal averted defeat at Turf Moor and prevented Burnley from leapfrogging their relegation rivals.\n\n“Brown has had a tough time. He is a nice kid. He hasn’t played badly, he has just missed opportunities,” said his manager, Tony Pulis, camouflaging his willingness to sell Ideye. Burnley, who cannot afford the luxury of £10m substitutes, must wish they had, but paid a heavy price for their inability to defend corners. Chris Brunt bundled in Callum McManaman’s set piece on the stroke of half- time. Ideye equalised in more forceful manner from Brunt’s right-wing corner, although Sean Dyche argued it should have been disallowed. “He gets a free header because there is a foul on David Jones,” said the Burnley manager. “If he tumbles to the floor, he gets it.”\n\nYet his team have conceded 14 goals, a league high, from headers this season and have squandered two-goal leads three times in the past four games. Themes are recurring with disturbing frequency, from the goalkeeper Tom Heaton’s inability to command his box to Burnley’s difficulty in maintaining their initial impact for the entire 90 minutes.\n\nThis would have been a fourth successive defeat but for a combination of Heaton, with a superb save, and Ben Mee, who made a goalline clearance, to deny Saido Berahino a redemptive winner. The youngster’s declaration he wanted to leave Albion, in an ill-timed and unauthorised interview, had prompted Pulis to say he was on the “naughty chair”, though he denied that was why Berahino began on the bench at Burnley.\n\nHe was soon summoned when Victor Anichebe limped off. “Saido showed his attitude,” said Pulis. “He is a top player. The problem is he lost his father at an early age and he has not had many mentors.” He wants his new signing to become one. “I am hoping that bringing [Darren] Fletcher in will make a big difference to Saido,” said Pulis, who appointed the Scot captain on his debut.\n\nBurnley can testify that goalscorers can become unsettled. Dyche felt interest in Danny Ings affected his performance at Sunderland. “The amount of media pressure on a young man can take a toll and I think it did last week,” his manager said. Burnley were adamant Ings would not leave in January and, rather than leaving Turf Moor, his deadline-day movements consisted of going to watch American Sniper. While the 22-year-old represents a very different type of sharpshooter to Chris Kyle, the protagonist in Clint Eastwood’s controversial film, he is increasingly lethal in his own line of work.\n\nHis fourth goal in five league games was, like Burnley’s first, beautifully worked. Ben Foster had already clawed Scott Arfield’s shot on to the bar when Ashley Barnes converted the third of three fine early chances.\n\nIngs apart, Burnley may not have the individual quality other sides possess but their goals showed terrific teamwork. Ings and Arfield exchanged a one-two before the striker lobbed in a cross that Barnes headed home. Then Kieran Trippier released George Boyd with a dummy. The winger accelerated into space and whipped in a cross. Ings met it with a perfectly placed header.\n\n“He was excellent with his movement, his endeavour, his effervescence,” said Dyche. “We were outstanding in the first half.”\n\n“They deserved to be 2-0 up,” admitted Pulis. “We started it as though it was a Sunday morning stroll. Half of them looked as though they were still in bed.” They were sub-standard in sub-zero temperatures. Pulis responded by bringing on Ideye for his left-back, Chris Baird.\n\nIt made for a more open second half when Burnley felt they merited a winner. Joleon Lescott cleared Jason Shackell’s looping header off his own line and Gareth McAuley escaped unpunished when Mee’s cross hit his arm.\n\n“I am very surprised, to put it mildly, we didn’t have a penalty,” an aggrieved Dyche added. “The handball is a definite.”\n\nMan of the match Danny Ings (Burnley)"}, {"date": "08/02/2015", "arena": "St James' Park, Newcastle", "attendance": 47763,

each other on the same course. Reunited on Tyneside, they both scored top marks for clever, game-changing use of substitutes but Hughes’ smart late tactical switch from 4-2-3-1 to 4-4-2 arguably ensured Stoke City’s manager departed with a deserved point.\n\nBy cancelling out Jack Colback’s opener, Peter Crouch’s 90th-minute equaliser deprived Carver of a first home win as Newcastle’s interim head coach. It seemed harsh on a man whose desire to succeed Alan Pardew on a longer term basis dictates that he must treat every game as an audition yet Stoke’s dominance of possession demanded some reward. Moreover Hughes had considerable justification in arguing that, having just escaped a second yellow card, Colback should not have been on the pitch at the time of his goal.\n\n“Not one for my DVD collection,” said Carver with considerable understatement at the end of a match that offered a stark reminder his side need to add creativity to enviable pace. “A frustrating day but a draw’s probably a fair result.”\n\nStoke largely controlled the first half but did not test Tim Krul until late in it. A flash of superb skill from Steven N’Zonzi and a fabulous, dinked, Stephen Ireland cross following the midfielder being played onside by Vurnon Anita combined to provide Mame Biram Diouf with a headed chance well saved by the Holland goalkeeper.\n\nNewcastle’s ability to switch the play in a split second ensured Hughes’ side could never quite relax. Yet nervous as his defence evidently were whenever Moussa Sissoko drove forward at formidable pace on the counterattack or Massadio Haïdara and Sammy Ameobi launched rapid attacks down the left, Asmir Begovic remained relatively untroubled.\n\nThe closest Carver’s players came to breaking the deadlock during the opening 45 minutes was the early moment when Begovic’s reflexes proved equal to Rémy Cabella’s header following his connection with a Sissoko cross. An opening created by Cabella losing Marc Wilson resulted in Ayoze Pérez sending a shot whizzing fractionally wide.\n\nIf there was enjoyment in watching Ireland’s clever low passing, Marc Muniesa’s ability to play from the back, Philipp Wollscheid’s defensive assurance, Pérez’s sometimes breathtaking technique and Colback’s intelligent, invariably incisive industry, there were far too many obvious balls. As good as Wollschied and Muniesa were at the heart of the visiting defence Newcastle failed to test them severely. Slightly fussy refereeing from Kevin Friend hardly enhanced the flow and his decision to book Ireland for what appeared to be a decent challenge on Colback seeming typically pedantic.\n\nThe mildly interesting rather than exactly magical tone continued well into the second half. Aware something needed to change Carver introduced further attacking pace in the shape of Papiss Cissé and, rather more controversially, Gabriel Obertan. Despite the crowd’s displeasure at seeing a far from delighted Cabella sacrificed for his fellow Frenchman, Carver did not have to wait long for vindication. Both Cissé and Obertan were involved in the move which concluded with Sissoko controlling the latter’s cross before laying off the ball to Colback whose swerving left-foot shot went in off a post.\n\nAggrieved that Colback, already booked for going in late on Muniesa, had escaped a yellow card for clattering into Victor Moses a couple of minutes earlier, Stoke’s bench looked far from amused.\n\n“The referee wasn’t brave enough to make the right decision at a key moment,” Hughes said. “It was clearly a second yellow. The referee needed to be strong enough to make the right decision. If they’d been down to 10 men we’d probably have won. He’s a good referee but some of his decisions left a lot to be desired.”\n\nAlthough Carver praised Friend’s performance while maintaining it “definitely wasn’t” a second yellow, Colback could not quite agree. “If I’d been sent off, I couldn’t have had much argument,’ he said. “I caught him.”\n\nIreland’s wonderful chipped finish soon defied Krul but he was fractionally offside and it proved his final act. With time running out, Hughes ripped up plan A and replaced his playmaker with Crouch.\n\nIf the arrival of an attacking partner galvanised Jonathan Walters, confrontation by 4-4-2 fazed Newcastle. Although Obertan missed a sitter, Krul saved well from Walters and Mehdi Abeid’s carelessness in possession boded badly for a suddenly concerned looking Carver.\n\nHis fears were confirmed as Geoff Cameron crossed and Crouch rose above Daryl Janmaat to direct a splendid header across the advancing Krul and into the bottom corner.\n\n“Some people say only Harry Kane scores those sort of goals nowadays,” Hughes said. “But Peter Crouch’s been scoring them for years.”\n\nMan of the match Marc Muniesa (Stoke City)"}, {"date": "08/02/2015", "arena": "Upton Park", "attendance": 34499,

before. To put it bluntly, United got away with a point here and, for all the progress that has taken place under Louis van Gaal, this remains a club struggling for an identity in the post-Ferguson era.\n\nNot that the United manager saw it like that, afterwards praising his team’s “fantastic football and fantastic spirit” during a second half when they reacted to Cheikhou’s Kouyaté’s wonderfully imaginative goal four minutes after the interval by cranking up the pressure until they got one themselves through Daley Blind. The assessment was not wholly off the mark but it raised eyebrows among those in attendance and there was far more acceptance of the Dutchman’s view that United had “played badly” during the first period when West Ham could and should have built up an unassailable lead.\n\nWest Ham’s Sam Allardyce calls Manchester United a ‘long-ball team’ Read more\n\nIn those opening 45 minutes and, in truth, for the bulk of this fixture, the hosts were the better team in every area of the pitch.

In their place came James Tomkins and Kouyaté, who worked tirelessly in marshalling West Ham’s defence, maintaining a high line when the hosts had the ball and clearing practically everything that came their way in the rare moments that United found the gusto and swagger to cause their opponents danger.\n\nFor Kouyaté, in particular, this was a day to remember. Playing his first match since returning from the Africa Cup of Nations, the Senegalese scored his second goal for West Ham since arriving from Anderlecht for £7m last June. And some goal it was too. Receiving the ball with his back towards goal, and after United had made a mess of clearing Noble’s free-kick, he juggled the ball twice before swivelling and hitting a shot which sailed past David De Gea via a deflection off Blind.\n\nManchester United’s total football fails to bring out best in Wayne Rooney | Barney Ronay Read more\n\nThe goal was West Ham’s 12th from a set piece this season — a Premier League high — and the least they deserved for their domination of proceedings to that point. Prior to the interval Enner Valencia had tested De Gea twice in a minute with drives and the Spanish goalkeeper also had to keep out Tomkins’ close-range stab with an outstretched boot after United’s defence had failed to clear Aaron Cresswell’s free-kick.\n\nDe Gea, as has often been the case this season, was United’s best player, making save after save, including a further two late in the second half from Noble and Nolan as West Ham looked to score a second, decisive goal. They proved to be crucial as, moments later, Blind struck.\n\nAlmost two of the four allocated minutes of stoppage time were up when Carl Jenkinson headed Marcos Rojo’s hopeful punt towards the edge of the area. Running into space, the Holland midfielder hit the ball first time and watched on as it crept past the sprawling Adrián. Cue bedlam amid the United supporters behind the goal and an almighty sense of relief among the players in white and black.\n\nManchester United in negotiations with David De Gea over new contract Read more\n\nAs Van Gaal conceded, his side were poor when it came to winning the second ball, generally looking slugglish and off the pace. The full-backs, Antonia Valencia and Luke Shaw – who was sent off late on for the second of two bookable offences – rarely ventured forward while positioned as the deepest United midfielder, Blind struggled to cope with the movement of Downing. Ahead of him Adnan Januzaj was largely anonymous and was replaced by Maourane Fellaini; Wayne Rooney worked tirelessly to influence the contest but constantly cut a frustrated figure.\n\nAnd how curious it was to see United’s third-highest scorer of all time tracking the runs of Nolan, particularly when Falcao put in another display to suggest United would be foolish to make his loan move a permanent one in the summer. The Colombian continued to look a shadow of his former, fantastic self here, never more so than on 76 minutes when, following a delicious through-pass from Van Persie, he skewed his shot wide with the goal gaping ahead of him.\n\nAt that stage West Ham looked on course for a deserved victory but then came the latest of late sucker punches. United remain fourth and in strong contention for Champions League qualification but champions-in-waiting they are certainly not.\n\nMan of the match Enner Valencia (West Ham United)"}, {"date":

outplayed Arsenal so thoroughly as Mauricio Pochettino’s did here, emerging triumphant after a pulsating contest that ended with Harry Kane the toast of Tottenham Hotspur again.\n\nThis was Kane’s first north London derby and how he revelled in the occasion. The striker, on Arsenal’s books as a youngster, was the catalyst for a remarkable comeback victory as Spurs produced an accomplished display to overturn a one-goal deficit after falling behind to a Mesut Özil volley.\n\nKane struck early in the second half to equalise and lifted the lid of a raucous White Hart Lane with four minutes remaining, elevating Tottenham above their rivals in the Premier League table and, on this evidence, deservedly so. Arsenal were anodyne in attack and, although they contained Spurs for the most part, switched off at the decisive moments.\n\nTottenham Hotspur’s Harry Kane hails fans after derby he ‘won’t forget’ Read more\n\nThey departed having been outplayed during a spiky contest that demonstrated just why these sides have been revelling in a renaissance since the new year. This was a high-quality, high-octane match of fierce pace; a frantic and compelling duel where strength out wide proved pivotal.\n\nTottenham have never finished above Arsenal during Wenger’s reign as manager but Pochettino’s side are growing as the season progresses. There is a long way to go, of course, but they have edged ahead in what promises to be an intriguing battle for a top-four place.\n\n“I think this is special,” Pochettino said. “It is a special game, a derby, and all that it means. We played with our brain, but showed passion and emotion. It’s special for our supporters. I’m very happy because of the victory and happy for the performance. I congratulate my players because the performance was brilliant.\n\n“We need to keep the same level because we can. We know it is difficult. This is our challenge, and to keep the players fit. I never look at the table. We need to go step by step, keep fighting and working hard. This is our challenge.”\n\nTottenham Hotspur v Arsenal: north London derby – in pictures! Read more\n\nThere were other outstanding performers in Pochettino’s side – notably the centre-midfield pairing of Nabil Bentaleb and Ryan Mason – and although Kane’s role was crucial, this was an excellent overall display. Spurs dominated the first half, yet forced only one real save from David Ospina, in the fifth minute, as Arsenal sat back and absorbed the pressure, while looking to exploit opportunities on the counter.\n\nKane was the man to test Ospina early on, receiving the ball from Mousa Dembélé on the left edge of the area, checking inside and curling an effort to the far post. Ospina, the Colombia goalkeeper, dived brilliantly to his left and tipped it behind for a corner, injuring himself in the process.\n\nAfter receiving treatment, Ospina picked himself up and claimed a Danny Rose cross from the left with ease. He was fit enough to continue and soon his side were in front, against the run of play.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mesut Özil, right, beats Hugo Lloris to put Arsenal 1-0 up at White Hart Lane. Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Action Images\n\nIt was Rose – who carried a threat whenever advancing forward – who was partially at fault for Özil’s opener. Danny Welbeck showed startling pace to knock the ball past the left-back and leave his opponent eating dust, before pulling it back for Olivier Giroud, on the edge of the area. Giroud, either with a pinpoint pass or a miscued shot, found Özil at the far post, and he volleyed the ball expertly past Hugo Lloris.\n\nArsenal were ecstatic, but it was backs to the wall for the remainder of a half in which Tottenham pushed their neighbours but failed to unlock the door. Rose flashed a low shot narrowly past the post after 22 minutes, and Ospina saved a 25-yard effort from Mason after Dembélé had capitalised on Per Mertesacker’s clumsy chest down.\n\nHarry Kane enters Tottenham folklore and an England future beckons | Jacob Steinberg Read more\n\nSpurs, though, did not have to wait long for their equaliser – and who else but Kane to deliver it, a deserved leveller from a striker in blistering form. From a corner in the 56th minute, Ospina stretched to keep out a Dembélé header but the ball only went as far as Kane, who gratefully swept it home at the far post.\n\nSoon afterwards, the goalkeeper leaped to his left to keep out a 25-yard shot from Bentaleb, as Spurs continued to press. However, Arsenal were still a threat on the counter, Welbeck cutting inside from the left and unleashing a drive that Lloris palmed wide.\n\n“Were we too focused on defending our goal? I think so,” said Wenger. “I believe that we made too many technical mistakes. They created more chances and, overall, we cannot dispute too much that they won the game. We were not very good and the referee was at our level.”\n\nOn Kane, he said: “He was good, as always. He grows and he has a good determination. He doesn’t stop, keeps going. The regret I have is that we gave him a cheap goal. It’s worrying that at the back, with five minutes to go, we always are there to make the same mistakes.”\n\nCometh the hour, though, cometh the man. The denouement was a fitting end to a thrilling match. Bentaleb swung the ball in from the left and there was Kane, towering above the red shirts, to guide a looping header into the net; his first goals in this derby, but surely not his last."}, {"date":

the semblance of a smile from the man who came back to English football insisting he wanted to be known as the Happy One. José Mourinho’s scowl has felt like a permanent attachment in recent times but this felt like a significant moment in the Premier League title race and it was not straightforward seeing off an Aston Villa side that had at least paid attention to the photograph of an empty goal splashed across the front of the Birmingham Mail. “Memo to Villa,” it read. “This is what a goal looks like.”\n\nPaul Lambert’s side certainly needed the reminder, bearing in mind the moment when Jores Okore headed in Carles Gil’s cross to make it 1-1, three minutes into the second half, brought up the 11-hour mark since their last top-division goal 43 days earlier. So, hallelujah, Villa have finally managed to equal the number of league goals Bournemouth have scored in Birmingham this season.\n\nUnfortunately for Villa, there have still been only two occasions all season when they have scored twice in a league game and Chelsea had enough time and self-belief to restore their winning position through Branislav Ivanovic’s decisive strike.\n\nEverton 0-0 Liverpool | Premier League match report Read more\n\nIvanovic is establishing himself as the ultimate odd job man – a full-back, centre-half, attacker, motivator and goalscorer all wrapped into one – and this was his fifth goal in his past six starts against Villa. There was still a third of the match to play but Villa had resorted to type and Christian Benteke’s introduction, having been dropped from Lambert’s starting XI, had little impact.\n\nMourinho brought on Juan Cuadrado, the £23m acquisition from Fiorentina, during those moments and Manchester City’s inability to beat Hull City at their own ground ultimately made it a hugely satisfying win for the leaders. True, they might have made easier work of it bearing in mind Eden Hazard opened the scoring with a superbly worked team goal after only eight minutes. They did, however, show title-winning qualities in their response to Villa’s first league goal in 2015 and, on the balance of play, they were clearly the better side.\n\nMourinho tried to argue that seven points amounted to “nothing” in a league where “nothing surprises me”. They missed Diego Costa at times and it was a difficult day for Didier Drogba, a month short of his 37th birthday and struggling to remind us of the player of old, barring those moments when he was flinging himself to the ground in pretend agony.\n\nYet Mourinho was twirling his hand in the air after the final whistle and his celebrations indicated he knew what an important victory this might be.\n\nTottenham Hotspur 2-1 Arsenal | Premier League match report Read more\n\nEarly on, it had looked like it would be a much more routine win when Drogba played the ball forward and Oscar, running through the inside-right channel, eluded Okore then played it inside for Willian. Hazard had anticipated the next pass, darting in front of Alan Hutton, and Willian delivered it with just the right amount of weight for his team-mate to turn a first-time shot past Brad Guzan.\n\nThe frustration inside Villa Park manifested itself in some voluble dissent aimed towards Tom Cleverley. Lambert could be seen taking exception to something that Rui Faria, Mourinho’s assistant, had said in the opposite dugout and was suspicious to learn that the Chelsea manager had described Villa’s squad as “one of the best” in the country, with a “very good bench and lots of solutions”. There is history here and Lambert, with two wins in 20 league games since signing his new contract, did not appreciate the flattery. “That’s his opinion,” he said. “Maybe he is trying to put pressure on me.”\n\nIf nothing else, Mourinho was guilty of serious exaggeration, especially given the way Willian, Oscar and Hazard endangered the home defence. Villa’s scoring drought had gone on so long there were supporters holding up posters with arrows to show the way to goal. Gil, a £3.2m signing from Valencia, looks like he might be a bargain and it was a beautiful little drop of the shoulder to fool Oscar before his cross picked out Okore at the back post.\n\nUnfortunately for Villa, Lambert’s players could not follow the crowd’s instructions again. Chelsea found some new impetus and when César Azpilicueta’s perseverance created the chance for Ivanovic he let fly with a left-foot shot that was still rising as it flew into the net."}, {"date":

to score, and therefore take even a point, from a match that until well into the second half they had created four or five good chances for every one created by their opponents, makes it very hard to see how they can possibly stay up.\n\nAs it was, Joe Ledley’s header shortly before the hour was enough for Alan Pardew to oversee his fifth win from his six matches in charge at Crystal Palace, and to increase the gap between these clubs from six points to nine. With Leicester’s next three league fixtures taking them to Arsenal, Everton and Manchester City, any optimism generated by a useful run of results around Christmas has been comprehensively dissipated.\n\nNigel Pearson, who left Andrej Kramaric, the striker he signed last month for £6.7m, on the bench until the final 20 minutes, was clearly aware he sounded something like a broken record. “Once again I have to front up to the thing that’s costing us, our inability to convert chances,” the Leicester manager said. “What can I do? Keep working with the players to turn it around. Today was a game we needed to get something out of it, we haven’t, so the gap’s bigger, but there’s still a long way to go. It’s not necessarily a defining moment.”\n\nNigel Pearson plays down drama after James McArthur touchline tangle Read more\n\nMany a Leicester supporter will be feeling it was precisely that, though, after watching their team’s now customary profligacy make itself felt early on when David Nugent, offered the opportunity to test Palace goalkeeper, Julián Speroniafter being found in space in the penalty area by the lively Riyad Mahrez, tried, and failed miserably, to float a cross to the far post instead.\n\nSoon afterwards Wes Morgan headed a corner down and straight into the hands of Speroni, but as the half-hour approached Leicester built up a head of steam. First Mahrez skinned Martin Kelly in the Palace area and drove in a low shot, which the diving Speroni touched back into the six-yard box and Esteban Cambiasso very nearly turned into the empty goal.\n\nThen Nugent, running away from goal, twisted to head a Mahrez corner against the angle of post and bar. Jeffrey Schlupp was the next to go close, allowed time to chest down a Nugent cross before firing in a low, bouncing volley that Speroni saved two-handed to his left.\n\nTottenham Hotspur 2-1 Arsenal | Premier League match report Read more\n\nPardew made a double switch at half-time, Brede Hangeland replacing Scott Dann, who was suffering the effects of a clash of heads with Morgan, and Yaya Sanogo coming on for the ineffective Jordon Mutch. Leicester continued to look likeliest to score and Paul Konchesky’s low cross-shot was almost turned in by the sliding Leonardo Ulloa, but Sanogo’s presence quickly became a factor and he won the corner that Hangeland headed back across goal for Ledley to head past Mark Schwarzer.\n\nLeicester looked certain to equalise when Nugent intercepted a back pass and rounded Speroni, only to decide the angle was too narrow. He tried to cut the ball back to Cambiasso but the Argentinian could not control it.\n\nPearson sent on Marc Albrighton, then two more strikers in Kramaric and Jamie Vardy in a desperate attempt to salvage something. Vardy came close to doing that, with a glancing header, and then with a powerful shot from an angle, but Speroni blocked both. “We showed great resilience and though we didn’t have the right balance between attacking and defending, particularly in the first half, we had a much better second half,” said Pardew.\n\n“I don’t think Nigel can be disappointed with the way his team played. They had a couple of chances, particularly on the back pass, and if they’d scored then it could have been a different result.”"}, {"date": "07/02/2015", "arena": "Etihad Stadium", "attendance": 45233, "home_team": {"name": "Manchester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Joe Hart", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pablo Zabaleta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Vincent Kompany", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martín Demichelis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gael Clichy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Samir Nasri", "yellows": [78], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fernando", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Fernandinho", "yellows": [85], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Silva", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [74]}, {"name": "Sergio Agüero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Edin Dzeko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [66]}], "subs": [{"name": "James Milner", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [90], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [66], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aleksandar Kolarov", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willy Caballero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jesus Navas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Frank Lampard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eliaquim Mangala", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stevan Jovetic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [74], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Hull City", "lineup": [{"name": "Allan McGregor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Dawson", "yellows": [68], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex Bruce", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paul McShane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ahmed Elmohamady", "yellows": [60], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jake Livermore", "yellows": [68], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Huddlestone", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Meyler", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [35], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gaston Ramirez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [76]}, {"name": "Robbie Brady", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Sone Aluko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [67]}], "subs": [{"name": "Dame N'Doye", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [76], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Curtis Davies", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Abel Hernandez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nikica Jelavic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steve Harper", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andrew Robertson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [67], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stephen Quinn", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Eighty-five years had passed since Hull last defeated Manchester City away. That sequence continues but only just as Manuel Pellegrini’s team came mightily close to a third home loss on the bounce, a result that would have left their title defence hanging by a thread.\n\nPellegrini was stalking the technical area hoping for a late equaliser or better during the closing minutes. Despite a fine Sergio Agüero attempt that hit the bar, it appeared it would never come. But then, two minutes into added time, James Milner, a substitute, drilled a 20-yard free-kick beyond Allan McGregor and the hosts had snatched a draw.\n\nWith their win at Aston Villa, it meant Chelsea extended their lead to seven but it could easily have been nine.\n\nHowever, City’s most recent league win remains the 3-2 victory over Sunderland on New Year’s Day. Since then, the champions have drawn 1-1 at Everton, lost 2-0 to Arsenal at home and shared a goalless draw with Chelsea at Stamford Bridge.\n\nAston Villa 1-2 Chelsea | Premier League match report Read more\n\nThere was also the embarrassment of being knocked out of the FA Cup by Middlesbrough here and so with this result City must hope to finally secure a league victory again at Stoke on Wednesday.\n\nHowever much the manager denies it, the champions continue to miss Yaya Touré, whose Ivory Coast take on Ghana in Sunday’sAfrica Cup of Nations final. This was the fifth match without the midfielder. “We have no doubt about how important a player Yaya is. But we play other games without Yaya and we could win,” Pellegrini said.\n\nThe first half was a contender for their poorest this season. By the close City were 1-0 down and being booed off by some of their fans, a sentiment the players could hardly argue with. Passes had gone awry, first touches were clumsy and their play was simply too slow. City had sleepwalked through the half and if the manager put a proverbial flea in each of his players’ ears at the break, the sight of Edin Dzeko being caught in possession soon after the referee, Jonathan Moss, blew to start the second half must surely have angered him.\n\nDavid Meyler’s opener, his first goal since April’s FA Cup semi-final win over Sheffield United, was a gift following a calamitous series of errors from the home defence.\n\nThe chief culprit was Martín Demichelis, the central defender again preferred to the £40m Eliaquiam Mangala, who was a substitute.\n\nBefore the mistake that initiated Meyler’s strike, Demichelis had over-hit a back-pass at Joe Hart. This caused the goalkeeper to miscue a hack away, sending the ball up in the air and when Demichelis tried to clean up the mess he had created the Argentinian contrived only to connect a boot with air.\n\nNigel Pearson plays down drama after James McArthur touchline tangle Read more\n\nThe episode was an unwanted augury. Moments later Hart could have collected the ball but this time Demichelis intervened to kick it away from his keeper’s hands.\n\nThen disaster struck. A Jake Livermore shot was superbly saved by Hart, but from the rebound Gaston Ramírez’s effort beat the keeper, struck his left post, and, following up, Meyler smashed home from close range.\n\nThirty-five minutes had been played but the goal had been coming all half. Earlier, a Robbie Brady cross from the left was headed against the bar by Ahmed Elmohamady after he too easily beat Gaël Clichy.\n\nTime and space were constantly available to Hull, something no champion-elect side should allow. Five minutes before the interval Sone Aluko could have doubled the visitors’ advantage but instead blasted over from close range.\n\nCity had only a weak Dzeko header that was aimed at McGregor and a sweet surge from Vincent Kompany that ended with him dinking a pass into Agüero’s path to show before the players turned around.\n\nWhat followed was a far brighter effort, the least that was expected following a dismal opening half. David Silva may have been right to be angered when Moss denied him a penalty after Alex Bruce bundled him over in the area but the problem was that despite more huffing and puffing City still suffered a sharpness deficit.\n\nKompany summed up the day his side were having when he blocked a shot from Silva and as the final 10 minutes arrived. Fernando, Dzeko and the Spaniard had all been pulled from the starting XI as Pellegrini desperately tried to avert a devastating reverse. In the end the Chilean did.

Chris Ramsey, in temporary charge at Loftus Road following Redknapp’s resignation on Tuesday, does not suffer from the knee trouble that afflicts his predecessor but he was made to feel the cruel pain that can come with leading a team as QPR were floored by a stoppage-time goal from Sadio Mané.\n\nRamsey has been told that he will be at the helm at least until after Tuesday’s trip to Sunderland as the club continues to deliberate over a long-term appointment, a deal with Tim Sherwood not having been reached yet. With a bit more luck Ramsey could have been heading north on the back of a victory.\n\nRangers enjoyed some narrow escapes in the first half before tightening up in the second and would have taken a crucial lead if not for a wonderful save 15 minutes from time by Fraser Forster. But as they strived to crown an encouraging performance by claiming three points that would have lifted them out of the relegation zone, QPR were hit by a devastating late counterattack from Southampton, whose quest for a Champions League spot received a boost that Ronald Koeman believes could be critical.\n\n“You have some key moments in a season and one of those was today,” said the Southampton manager, whose side are now third in the table, at least until Manchester United play West Ham on Sunday. “After the defeat of last week we had to show how we like to play football and to get a result. That’s the fourth away win in a row and that’s fantastic.”\n\nThe lineup that Ramsey chose showed his intention to inject more creativity into Rangers by bringing out the good side of enigmatic talents who had fallen out of favour with Redknapp. That applies most obviously to Adel Taarabt, who had spent most of the season in internal exile at Loftus Road after losing the faith of the former manager. Ramsey showed his trust in the player by awarding him only his second Premier League start of the season, one of four alterations to the Rangers side.\n\nSouthampton started better. Rangers have had a vexing tendency to sabotage themselves this season and Rob Green was nearly punished for a misjudgment in the sixth minute, but Mané shot wide from 30 yards with the goalkeeper inexplicably marooned outside his box. Taarabt, deployed just behind Charlie Austin, struggled to get involved but in the 10th minute he produced a flourish of trickery that took him past an opponent before he was fouled. That was a cue for the home crowd to air an old favourite: “Taarabt’s too good for you.”\n\nAs it turned out, there were no more reasons to reprise the song and Taarabt was replaced in the 63rd minute. “We did see glimpses of the brilliance that he has and I’m hopeful that when he becomes more conditioned he can show what he’s got,” said Ramsey.\n\nSouthampton were forced into a defensive reshuffle after the left-back Matt Targett went off with a head injury from a clash with Matt Phillips. The 19-year-old was taken to hospital for scans but Koeman said he had been assured the injury was not as bad as feared. Southampton adjusted well and remained the more dangerous, especially Mané, whose speed made him a constant menace. But José Fonte came closest to opening the scoring in the first half, volleying against the crossbar following a corner from James Ward-Prowse.\n\nIn the second period Rangers grew in solidity and confidence. Mauro Zárate curled a shot just over from 20 yards. In the 74th minute Joey Barton unleashed a strike from the edge of the area and Austin got a flick to it six yards out, forcing Forster into a superb reflex save.\n\nIn the third minute of stoppage time Southampton swept forward and worked the ball wide to Maya Yoshida on the left. He fed Mané, who held off a defender and fired into the roof of the net from a tight angle. Ramsey was left to perform a popular managerial routine and identify positives amid a big negative, one made potentially much worse by the sight of Austin leaving the ground on crutches. “It gives a lot of hope to the owners and fans to see that at least players are trying to their best to keep us in the division,” he said."}, {"date": "07/02/2015", "arena": "The Liberty Stadium", "attendance":

The 32-year-old scored his second Sunderland goal in three Premier League starts in the 1-1 draw, becoming the first player to register against every one of the 20 clubs in the top flight.\n\nPoyet believes the 55-times capped Defoe can do even better than that and once more play for an England side he last represented against Chile in November 2013. “When you pick strikers you pick those in form and scoring goals,” the Sunderland manager said.\n\n“We saw today Harry Kane at Spurs and it’s an obvious choice, but Jermain has a chance if Wayne Rooney plays in midfield. But that’s up to Roy [Hodgson] to decide. I respect the manager of the national team and the only thing the player can do is perform.”\n\nDefoe’s arrival has lifted Sunderland, who battled for a point in south Wales after back-to-back wins, against Burnley and at Fulham in the FA Cup, for the first time this season.\n\n“We are a different team with Jermain,” Poyet said after the former Sunderland loanee Ki had deprived his side of all three points with a diving second-half header.\n\n“When you’ve got a player sooner or later that you know is going to score it makes the rest of the team believe that you’ve got a chance to win football games.\n\n“I’ve been killing myself to think, ‘Do I need to have to give him a rest?’ He’s been out for four months. But I can’t and I have to say, ‘Sorry J, you have to play because I cannot let games go past without playing you’.”\n\n“[Costel] Pantilimon made a couple of very good saves so you cannot say we deserved to win, but we had a very good first half and I was pleased with the way we played and passed the ball.”\n\nSwansea were left to rue Ki’s disallowed first-half effort as he was flagged for offside moments before Defoe fired Sunderland into a 42nd-minute lead. Garry Monk, the Swansea manager, said: “It’s one of those where sometimes you get them, sometimes you don’t.We have had a few like that this season.”\n\nMonk felt Swansea created enough chances to win, but said his side were punished for switching off. “It was frustrating as they scored from their only shot when we gave Defoe too much space. We did not close it down and we got done, which set us back.\n\n“We got a good equaliser, tried to push for the second and I felt we were the better team, but it was not to be.”"}, {"date": "07/02/2015", "arena": "Goodison Park", "attendance": 39621, "home_team": {"name": "Everton", "lineup": [{"name": "Joel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Seamus Coleman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Stones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Jagielka", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bryan Oviedo", "yellows": [72], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James McCarthy", "yellows": [37], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gareth Barry", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Muhamed Besic", "yellows": [79], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [86]}, {"name": "Kevin Mirallas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [60]}, {"name": "Steven Naismith", "yellows": [79], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [85]}, {"name": "Romelu Lukaku", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Darron Gibson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Arouna Kone", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ross Barkley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [85], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Lennon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [60], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tyias Browning", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Antolin Alcaraz", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [86], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Russell Griffiths", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Liverpool", "lineup": [{"name": "Simon Mignolet", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Emre Can", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Skrtel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mamadou Sakho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordon Ibe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordan Henderson", "yellows": [79], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lucas Leiva", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [16]}, {"name": "Alberto Moreno", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Gerrard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Raheem Sterling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [82]}, {"name": "Philippe Coutinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [56]}], "subs": [{"name": "Glen Johnson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dejan Lovren", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rickie Lambert", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [82], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daniel Sturridge", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [56], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Allen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [16], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lazar Markovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Ward", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "This is likely to be remembered as Steven Gerrard’s farewell Merseyside derby, but not for very long and not for many other reasons. It was one of the more sterile encounters between the old rivals, with little quality on show and some of the big name performers in both sides failing to enliven the occasion.\n\nGerrard played the whole game, even though his display was among the ordinary ones, and while the ideal script demanded a final flourish from a player who has appeared in 33 of these dust-ups, the prosaic reality was that neither side produced anything exceptional. Reader, it was dull.\n\n“A fascinating tactical battle,” Roberto Martínez called it, which was one way of avoiding the uncomfortable reality that the home side did not manage a shot on target until the 86th minute.\n\nTottenham Hotspur 2-1 Arsenal | Premier League match report Read more\n\n“We were clearly the better team,” Brendan Rodgers countered, offering some light fiction of his own. “It was only when we switched off for the last five minutes that they had an attempt on goal.”\n\nGerrard began in an advanced position in Liverpool’s front three, was booed as he took the field, cheered ironically when he passed straight into touch early in the first half, and booed at the end. Everton fans do not really hate him; they will just be glad to see the back of him.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Brendan Rodgers says that Liverpool were the better side – video\n\nIt was a Gerrard free-kick that brought the first save of the game from Joel Robles, though the home side created the best opportunity of the opening quarter when James McCarthy broke up a Liverpool attack and fed Séamus Coleman, whose cross found Steven Naismith at the far post in more space than he possibly realised and a poor first touch cost him the chance.\n\nEverton were beginning to wear Liverpool down by the mid-point of the first half, not creating a great deal but using their three defensive midfielders to stifle and keep their opponents pressed back. Liverpool have players who can break quickly on the counter, however, and it was a new addition to their ranks, Jordon Ibe, who almost broke the deadlock with a terrific shot from the edge of the area that struck a post. Just recalled from a loan spell at Derby, the 19-year-old runs with the ball in a manner similar to Raheem Sterling, or at least how Sterling usually runs. Here neither Sterling nor Philippe Coutinho had much to offer, as if their Cup exertions at Bolton in midweek had drained them.\n\nNigel Pearson plays down drama after James McArthur touchline tangle Read more\n\nBy half-time the game had settled into a sedate pattern, with both teams cautious and unadventurous. This fixture last season produced six goals, shared equally, but this was nothing like as open or attacking and there was little in the way of clear-cut chances. While Liverpool at least could claim a couple of attempts on goal from distance, Everton had barely tested Simon Mignolet by the interval. That almost changed at the start of the second half when the goalkeeper had to scramble to cover a Kevin Mirallas free-kick, though the ball was always going narrowly wide. With Coutinho feeding Sterling to bring a save from Robles at the other end, the contest showed signs of warming up a little in the second period, and Gerrard would have been on target with an ambitious overhead kick had Naismith not got his head in the way to divert the shot for a corner.\n\nRodgers sent on Daniel Sturridge with just over half an hour to go, shortly before Martínez introduced Aaron Lennon to see if the Tottenham loanee could add some pace and penetration. What the home side really needed was a way of bringing Romelu Lukaku more effectively into the game, but Ross Barkley, supposedly Everton’s most creative player, remained on the bench. Lukaku was a peripheral figure for much of the game, his frustration at a lack of involvement leading to him being repeatedly pulled up for offside. That in turn led to frustration on the terraces, because a £28m striker should not be regularly falling foul of the offside flag.\n\nMignolet left his line smartly to cut off Lukaku when the striker did manage to stay onside midway through the second half, shortly after Alberto Moreno had missed two half chances at the other end. The first came to his wrong foot after Ibe had done well to find him in the box, the second was a shooting opportunity from further out that he blazed high into the Park End. Jordan Henderson, Naismith and Muhamed Besic were all booked when the obligatory fracas broke out with 12 minutes left, raising the temperature slightly but not the overall quality.\n\nFinally, with only five minutes remaining, Martínez sent on Barkley, just after Rodgers had accepted Sterling was not having one of his better days and put on Rickie Lambert in his place. Barkley’s very first pass was a gem, inviting a shot from Coleman that Mignolet actually had to save. His second was pretty good too, sending Lennon to the byline for a cross the winger put slightly too close to Mignolet, who gathered it gratefully.\n\nFor Everton it was a case of the best being saved until last, though by the grand standards this fixture has set over the years, the best of a mediocre meeting was nothing to write home about."}, {"date": "01/02/2015", "arena": "Emirates Stadium",

quickly sprang to mind: they’ve done this without Alexis Sánchez. The Gunners top-scorer and undisputed player of the season was absent with a hamstring injury, yet the side still sparkled. Five goals were scored by five players in a collective showing of devastating ruthlessness and one which adds fuel to the belief that Arsène Wenger’s men will yet again clinch a place in the Premier League’s top four.\n\nThey sit in fifth and, after Southampton’s defeat by Swansea City, are level on points with Ronald Koeman’s side. Crucially, Arsenal have won three successive league fixtures for the first time this campaign, as well as showing a thrilling thirst for goals, with this rout making it 13 scored in their last four outings in all competitions. Sánchez will only add to the potency upon his return.\n\nIf that is a chilling thought for those teams battling with Arsenal for a Champions League place, some hope can be taken from Aston Villa’s performance here. The visitors controlled proceedings for large spells, overall enjoying 52% of possession, and had Andreas Weimann or Christian Benteke made more of their close-range efforts either side of half-time, when Arsenal were only 1-0 up, things could have been very different. As Paul Lambert, the Villa manager, observed: “It was a strange game, never a 5-0 game.”\n\nAston Villa’s defensive naivety plays into rampant Arsenal’s hands | Michael Cox Read more\n\nYet ultimately here was proof that when Arsenal are in the mood there are few, if any, sides in the country better equipped at slicing through opposition, with their first three goals, scored by Olivier Giroud, Mesut Özil and Theo Walcott, all coming in blink-of-an-eye breakaway surges.\n\nThe first was arguably the best. With Villa pressing aggressively and high up the pitch, Per Mertesacker hooked the ball into midfield where Özil moved it on to Giroud with a sumptuous first-time, over-the-shoulder flick. The Frenchman had a clear path towards goal and with defenders rushing back into position, he kept his cool and lifted the ball over the outrushing Brad Guzan.\n\nThe second, on 56 minutes, came after another attack from Villa, who were admirably attempting to halt a woeful run of five games without a goal. Özil and Giroud swapped roles, with the latter feeding the German after Walcott had won possession. Özil, coming infield from the left wing, finished coolly for his second goal in as many games.\n\nSouthampton 0-1 Swansea City | Premier League match report Read more\n\nBy the time Walcott made it 3-0 just after the hour mark with a first-time shot, having quickly exchanged passes with Santi Cazorla, the game was all but over as a contest. Lambert was left to rue what might have been had Weimann directed his header from Carles Gil’s cross just before the break further away from the reach of David Ospina, and Benteke done more to test the Arsenal goalkeeper with an unmarked drive soon after play had resumed.\n\nEven Wenger had sympathy for the visitors. “I feel a bit for Villa because they gave a lot,” said the Frenchman. “The second goal was a real blow for them but overall they fought very hard.\n\n“But in general our offensive game was good today. We always looked dangerous when we got through their lines, and defensively we were sound as well. This was a positive day for us.”\n\nJanuary’s deadline day keeps punters glued but managers can come unstuck | Sean Ingle Read more\n\nOf that there was no doubt and Arsenal, as their manager stated, caught the eye with their sturdiness at the back and with their ruthlessness in attack. Francis Coquelin again impressed as a holding midfielder while the four defenders behind him also generally looked assured. Watching from the bench, the new £11.3m Brazilian centre-back Gabriel Paulista may have wondered how and when he will get into this side.\n\nCazorla, who was yet again outstanding for the hosts, made it 4-0 with a less-than-outstanding penalty on 75 minutes, with Héctor Bellerín’s low finish in stoppage time putting the cap on what was the first occasion this season that Arsenal had scored five times in a match. Next is Saturday’s north London derby: sixth-placed Tottenham Hotspur versus fifth with both teams in encouraging form; it promises to be some clash.\n\nFor Aston Villa, it is now eight league games without victory and, as part of that spell, a little over 10 hours without a goal. For all the positives they can take from this fixture, that is a desperate run and with Chelsea to come next, the rot is unlikely to halt soon. In the circumstances it was no surprise to hear Lambert suggest that having signed Scott Sinclair on loan from Manchester City last week – he made his debut as a second-half substitute here – he is looking to add to the squad before Monday’s transfer deadline.\n\n“You can’t print what I’m feeling at the moment,” said the Scot. “We don’t want to be in this position – we’ve been in it for too long. All we can do is keep persevering and working hard.

They also had to demonstrate they could penetrate despite the sale of Wilfried Bony to Manchester City, the suspension of Gylfi Sigurdsson, the injury to Wayne Routledge and the loss to international duty of Ki Sung-yueng – that quarter accounts for almost 80% of Swansea’s league goals this season. The Welsh side came up trumps on both fronts. Monk was delighted at his team for proving that they can be tigerish defenders as well as tidy passers.\n\n“We’ve been in a difficult moment, especially in the last two games where we haven’t shown that commitment,” said Monk. “You can play poorly any time but not showing commitment is disappointing. But this was a very committed display and tactically very clever. We had a game-plan and I thought we executed that very well and were good for the three points. To be a good team you have to be able to adapt to different situations.”\n\nSouthampton came into the game needing to adapt too as they were also without influential players because of injury – Morgan Schneiderlin, Victor Wanyama and Toby Alderweireld. But their start suggested those absences might not hinder them as they quickly took charge. They should have scored after six minutes when Nathaniel Clyne whacked an excellent low cross into the box and James Ward-Prowse met it 12 yards out, but the goalkeeper Lukas Fabianski reacted sharply to turn away the midfielder’s low shot.\n\nAs ever the raids by Southampton’s full-backs and wingers were proving a menace but in the 13th minute, after almost constant pressure by the hosts, Swansea nearly ambushed them on the counterattack. Shelvey flipped a dainty pass through to Bafétimbi Gomis who took one touch before flashing a fine half-volley inches wide from the edge of the box.\n\nSeven minutes later Shelvey found Gomis with a quick free-kick and the striker forced a save from Fraser Forster.There was no question, however, that the visitors’ priority was on defending. They stationed 10 players behind the ball as often as possible. Southampton found penetration difficult despite continuing to dominate.\n\nWard-Prowse, Steven Davis and Harrison Reed were industrious in central areas but none found the sort of drive or inspiration that Wanyama or Schneiderlin would have been expected to provide. Instead Shelvey was looking the most menacing midfielder as he stormed forward from deep after 60 minutes and rasped a low shot against a post from 25 yards.\n\nThat provoked an immediate response from Southampton but neither Graziano Pellè’s header nor Ward-Prowse’s shot from 18 yards looked likely to beat Fabianski.\n\nKoeman replaced Reed with Sadio Mané in an effort to give his team more pep and unpredictability. But Swansea’s resistance remained steadfast and seven minutes from time they lashed out with the counterpunch the home fans had been dreading, Shelvey smashing a superb shot into the net.\n\nSwansea held on to their lead jealously, Ashley Williams twice clearing off the line from Mané. Bertrand’s exasperation then got the better of him as he was shown a straight red card for a dangerous tackle on Barrow. Pellè, who had been shackled by Williams for most of the match, had a chance to mitigate the ill-effects of this game in stoppage time but blasted the ball over from 10 yards.\n\n“I’m frustrated of course, because I didn’t think we deserved to lose,” said Koeman, who is under no illusions about the size of the task facing his side as a formidable posse gains pace behind them.\n\n“We can expect that teams like Arsenal, Tottenham and Liverpool to win games because they are big teams with good players. For us it’s difficult to keep our position in the table, we know that. We have to be very good in every game. We saw today that if every individual player is not on his best level then it’s more difficult.”\n\nMan of the match Jonjo Shelvey (Swansea City)"}, {"date": "31/01/2015", "arena": "KCOM Stadium", "attendance": 23925, "home_team": {"name": "Hull City", "lineup": [{"name": "Allan McGregor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ahmed Elmohamady", "yellows": [45], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Dawson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Curtis Davies", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andrew Robertson", "yellows": [64], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [71]}, {"name": "David Meyler", "yellows": [25], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [56]}, {"name": "Jake Livermore", "yellows": [89], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Huddlestone", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gaston Ramirez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Abel Hernandez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [67]}, {"name": "Nikica Jelavic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Alex Bruce", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robbie Brady", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [71], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paul McShane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steve Harper", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Ince", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [67], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sone Aluko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [56], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stephen Quinn", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Newcastle United", "lineup": [{"name": "Tim Krul", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daryl Janmaat", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mike Williamson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fabricio Coloccini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Massadio Haidara", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Vurnon Anita", "yellows": [29], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Colback", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rémy Cabella", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [40], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [72]}, {"name": "Moussa Sissoko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sammy Ameobi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [50], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Ayoze Pérez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [82]}], "subs": [{"name": "Davide Santon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Papiss Cisse", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [82], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yoan Gouffran", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [78], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [72], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gabriel Obertan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Emmanuel Riviere", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mehdi Abeid", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jak Alnwick", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "For one son of the north-east an exciting new chapter; for the other an horrific dose of reality. While John Carver commemorated his first match in permanent charge of Newcastle with victory, Steve Bruce was left to contemplate a seismic struggle to avoid the second Premier League relegation of his managerial career. It did not require the goading of Newcastle’s 2,500 travelling supporters to spell it out for him.\n\nAn even contest, played out in unforgiving conditions, turned during a 10-minute spell either side of the interval when two Hull mistakes contributed to Newcastle opening up a 2-0 lead.\n\nFirst, Andrew Robertson, one of a quartet of home players returning from injury, gifted possession to the France midfielder Remy Cabella with an ill-judged pass and a player who the former manager Alan Pardew claimed was not ready for the English top flight six weeks ago offered a counter-argument with a stunning drive that left Allan McGregor helpless.\n\nWest Bromwich Albion 0-3 Tottenham | Premier League match report Read more\n\nThen, five minutes after the break, Sammy Ameobi exploited Hull’s vulnerability with the ball at the back to equally dynamic effect as he took the invitation to swerve a 25-yard shot through a hesitant defence.\n\n“It was a good away performance. I want this job and we have refocused the guys’ season. It’s now a 15-game season for us,” said Carver, who was previously winless since inheriting the job from Pardew. “They now know I am the head coach and we’re going to go forward.”\n\nPreying on a lack of confidence in their opponents, who have now failed to score in 12 of their past 16 matches, Newcastle completed the rout when the substitute Yoan Gouffran strode through the middle and was rewarded in the 78th minute for his endaevour when his shot deflected in off Ahmed Elmohamady’s attempted block.\n\nEarlier, Elmohamady had provided the controversy in a fixture mired in it last season by Pardew’s head-butt on David Meyler, when he tried to fool the referee, Phil Dowd, a minute before the interval. Having won a free-kick on the right flank, the Egyptian full-back then emerged from a posse of bodies to divert Gastón Ramírez’s deadball beyond the Newcastle goalkeeper, Tim Krul, only for his celebratory charge to Bruce on the touchline to be aborted by the fourth official. Elmohamady was rightly booked for handball.\n\nStoke City 3-1 QPR | Premier League match report Read more\n\n“We are struggling at the moment but thankfully the right decision was made in the end,” said Bruce. “It was a reaction rather than cheating but fair play to the fourth official because you don’t want to score a goal like that.”\n\nBruce is attempting to address a lack of creativity with the recruitment of Tottenham’s England winger Aaron Lennon and Lokomotiv Moscow’s Senegal striker Dame N’Doye before Monday night’s transfer deadline. He will be hoping they were not tuned into Saturday’s live lunchtime match.\n\nSuch is Hull’s predicament that the elements would have claimed an assist had their closest second-half chance gone in. But the quick-thinking Vurnon Anita hacked off the goalline after Fabricio Coloccini’s sliced clearance caught the wind. Then, just after the hour, Nikica Jelavic’s bodging of a chance inside the six-yard box, after Krul parried a Ramírez cross-shot, summed up their day.\n\nA decade ago, Bruce went down with Birmingham, but has maintained his confidence that last year’s FA Cup finalists will not go the same way. His new assistant, Mike Phelan, starts work with plenty to address.\n\n“You earn your money from now and it’s my job to lift the people who are a bit shell-shocked and wake them up a bit,” said Bruce. “We are in serious trouble and we have to find the form our big players showed last season.”\n\nNewcastle United’s Rémy Cabella celebrates the opener.

A dismal sequence of results was checked in south London at Crystal Palace’s expense, with a narrow but restorative victory a reminder perhaps that this team have been loitering in the bottom half for far too long. The recovery is under way.\n\nAnything gained from this awkward contest would have represented progress given a recent run of one win in 13 and five successive Premier League defeats on the road, but Everton were rugged and canny in prevailing. Gareth Barry and Muhamed Besic infuriated Palace all afternoon, breaking up play efficiently and disrupting the hosts’ rhythm with their task made easier by Marouane Chamakh’s early departure through injury.\n\nThe visitors generated a flurry of late opportunities on the break to warp the statistical analysis but, for all Roberto Martínez’s customary positivity, this was essentially a gritty away win. The flair can wait. “We had to be perfect to win against a team full of confidence, but it was a very professional performance,” said Martínez. “We managed the game very well, carried a good threat and defended with a lot of concentration. We know we’d raised expectations and we’re playing catch-up in the league now, and that we want to be in a better position, but we’re ready now to compete.”\n\nIf they had arrived wary of Palace’s recent form, it was the visitors who celebrated the ideal opening, their first foray forward prompting Damien Delaney to over-commit as he attempted to intercept John Stones’s pass with Steven Naismith sprinting clear to the byline. His low centre was fizzed across the six-yard box where Julián Speroni could only push the ball on to the on-rushing Romelu Lukaku, the rebound nestling in the corner.\n\nThe Belgian’s pace and brawn unsettled the home side’s rearguard throughout, the striker a bustling presence in the channels even if his heavy touch, and some wild finishing, denied him further reward. “But I was pleased with the infectious way he was working in the forward line, very powerful and fresh,” added Martínez. “He sets the standards of our attacking play and he loves taking the responsibility.” He bruised the home side here though, in truth, this all felt like a reality check for Alan Pardew.\n\nThe Palace manager had won his first four games in charge, but will arguably have learned more about the task he has taken on in untimely defeat. Certainly the need to reintroduce Mile Jedinak – captain of Australia’s Asia Cup winning side earlier in the day – and Yannick Bolasie is clear. The former should be available at Leicester on Saturday, where Pape Souaré, a £3.5m signing from Lille who will train with his team-mates for the first time on Tuesday, should offer balance at left-back. How Pardew’s team react to a first setback will be crucial.\n\nThey might still have forced parity, particularly in the frenzied spell of pressure whipped up immediately after the concession. Phil Jagielka hacked Dwight Gayle’s clever flick from the goalline – “Whoever invented that goalline technology needs a kick up the bum,” said Pardew – with the impressive Stones blocking well from Yaya Sanogo, on home debut, and Chamakh. Yet the latter’s departure with a broken nose having emerged dazed and bloodied from a clash of heads with Séamus Coleman undermined their efforts. The former Arsenal forward is reborn as a No10 these days and had suggested he might unsettle Besic and Barry. Pardew bemoaned the loss of his “guile”.\n\nWithout him, Palace became far too frantic. Joel Robles did well to deny Jason Puncheon from distance just before the interval but the quality had rather ebbed from the contest, the home side’s desperation a mess of poor decisions or overhit delivery. It was Everton who threatened more coherently on the counter. Lukaku just failed to convert from Aiden McGeady’s low centre with the Irishman later forcing Speroni into a fine one-handed save from long range. As it transpired, they did not need a second to squeeze home. Everton can start to look onwards and upwards again.\n\nLiverpool 2-0 West Ham United | Premier League match report Read more"}, {"date": "31/01/2015", "arena": "Anfield", "attendance": 44718,

secure a hard-earned victory against West Ham United.\n\nSturridge returned, from five months out injured, as a substitute in the second half against the Hammers, and within 12 minutes of his entrance had finished off the kind of chance that Liverpool have frequently struggled to convert in his absence.\n\nRodgers, though, was keen to urge caution over the expectation placed upon Sturridge, given that this was the first time he had featured for the Reds since their 3-0 victory over Tottenham Hotspur at the end of August.\n\n“It was nice for him and he’s been out for a long time,” Rodgers said. “It’s about managing his game time.

I’m delighted for him, but it’s about managing that integration in the team.”\n\nDespite Sturridge’s goal, there was no denying that Sterling was the central figure in Liverpool’s dominance of Sam Allardyce’s side.\n\nAt the beginning of the month, Rodgers afforded the 20-year-old the luxury of a sunshine break in Jamaica, and it appears to have refreshed and re-energised the youngster.\n\nSterling has been playing his best football of the campaign since then, and he was simply in a different class to everybody else on the pitch at Anfield .\n\n“I thought Raheem was excellent again,” said Rodgers. “We had to compete and battle, but some of the football today was outstanding. In the second half, we controlled the game and took our goals, so I’m very pleased.”\n\nAllardyce’s side have been one of the Premier League’s surprise packages in this campaign, but they were facing a tough ask to win against Liverpool.\n\nThe last time West Ham came away from Anfield with maximum points in a league game, Harold Macmillan was prime minister and She Loves You by the Beatles was No.1 in the charts.\n\nOn that day, in September 1963, Geoff Hurst and Martin Peters scored in a 2-1 win – and, no doubt, both would have approved of Sterling’s display.\n\nIn some respects, Sterling, so light on his feet and with the ball seemingly glued to his bootlaces, is a throwback to the wingers of that era, and he was Liverpool’s major threat, albeit in a more central role.\n\nSterling should have won a penalty just before half-time, when Joey O’Brien grappled with him, and, seconds later, Lazar Markovic missed a golden chance to put Liverpool ahead when he seized on Stewart Downing’s sloppy pass, but – with just the West Ham keeper, Adrián, to beat – he fired past the post.\n\nHowever, six minutes after the break, Sterling scored the goal that his impressive display thoroughly deserved when he finished off a slick Liverpool move.\n\nHe was picked out on the edge of the box by Alberto Moreno, on the left flank, and, with his back to goal, chested the ball to Coutinho, adroitly spun Winston Reid, and – when he collected the return pass – struck a low shot past Adrián.\n\nAnfield rose to its feet to salute Sturridge’s entrance to the pitch in the 68th minute, and the striker showed that his razor-sharp instincts have not been numbed, as he sealed the win with Liverpool’s second goal. He received a clever ball from Coutinho and fired past Adrián at his near post, to put the icing on the cake for the Reds.\n\nThere was not a hint of nervousness about Sturridge’s finish, but the same might not be said of Liverpool’s top-four rivals, who will all be glancing over their shoulders.\n\n“The penetration and, slowly, the performance is getting better and better,” said Rodgers.\n\n“Offensively, we were bright, and the positioning of the team was good, with really good tactical discipline in the team.\n\n“Again, defensively, when they had to deal with the pressure – I thought Sakho was outstanding, really aggressive and strong, with Martin Skrtel; both of them were very good.\n\n“I’m excited about the whole collective; there are talents throughout the team, young players that are developing very quickly. It’s good to see.”\n\nAllardyce had few complaints with the result and was left counting the cost, with injuries to Andy Carroll and James Collins, who both limped off clutching their hamstrings.\n\n“We had too many injuries and, in the second half, we dropped off too deep, and allowed Sterling much more space,” he said. “It wasn’t our day, and we didn’t really have enough to cause them problems.”\n\nManchester United 3-1 Leicester City | Premier League match report Read more"}, {"date": "31/01/2015", "arena": "Old Trafford", "attendance": 75329, "home_team": {"name":

Manchester United might have done more than rest on their laurels and lose the second half one-nil.\n\n“I was very pleased at half-time and I asked my players to kill the game, because I remember what happened at Leicester,” Louis van Gaal said. “I think we killed it too much, playing too many balls backwards and sideways, but I am happy with the result. Only in two second half moments was there a lack of concentration and from one of those Leicester scored.”\n\nPlaying 4-4-2 makes Van Gaal’s ass twitch (his expression) but in his search for goals against the Premier League’s bottom club he successfully employed an extremely attacking variation, almost 4-3-3, with Ángel Di María at the point of a midfield diamond and Daley Blind the only player ahead of the back four with any real defensive credentials.\n\nAnder Herrera, left on the bench despite Michael Carrick’s unavailability, must wonder what he must do to get a game, though at least United fans got a chance to evaluate Adnan Januzaj’s progress and see Di María in a more orthodox role.\n\nLiverpool 2-0 West Ham United | Premier League match report Read more\n\nThat meant Wayne Rooney playing deeper than ever in midfield, and the United captain was lucky to get away with a wayward back pass midway through the first half that almost let Jeffrey Schlupp in on goal. Van Gaal’s ass must have been twitching like a rabbit’s nose at that point but Antonio Valencia just got back in time to put Schlupp off, hurrying the forward into shooting high and wide. That was the first real opening of the game, though Robin van Persie missed a decent chance a couple of minutes later, miscueing completely from a Luke Shaw cross that gave him a presentable opportunity in front of goal.\n\nSo far, so typical of United’s patchy season, yet sooner or later the class acts in the home lineup were bound to click. Just as the home crowd was in danger of forgetting what a goal looked like, two arrived in the space of five minutes either side of the half-hour mark, United asserting their authority and recovering their reputation for attacking flair at the same time. The opener was a goal of the highest class despite a suspicion of offside, not quite as wonderful as Van Persie’s header against Spain in last year’s World Cup but an equally effective contribution from the same two Dutch players. Blind won the ball cleanly just beyond the centre circle and sent a searching ball forward for Van Persie to run on to, one that the striker was again able to dispatch with a single touch, this time producing a right-foot half-volley. Van Persie was also involved in the next goal, supplying the pass for Di María to accept and accelerate into the box, and though Mark Schwarzer saved the initial shot Radamel Falcao was sharp enough to beat Marcin Wasilewski to the rebound.\n\nWest Bromwich Albion 0-3 Tottenham | Premier League match report Read more\n\nWhile a two-goal cushion ought to have been enough for a United side returning to form, memories are still fresh of the 3-1 lead surrendered at Leicester in September in the 5-3 defeat that Van Gaal referred to in his programme notes as his worst day in his present job.\n\nLeicester did not look like mounting a similar fightback, though United were grateful all the same for an extra goal before the interval. Rooney’s corner was touched on by the influential Blind and Wes Morgan’s attempt to head clear only found Schwarzer’s top-left corner.\n\nWith Marcos Rojo assured at the heart of the United defence there was no way back for Leicester. When David Nugent was gifted a chance shortly after coming on after Phil Jones under-cooked a back pass, David de Gea was alert to the situation and left his line to get a crucial touch. Nugent’s arrival did signal a determination to keep going from Leicester, however, and the visitors managed to deny United a clean sheet when Wasilewski beat Rooney and Jones to head in a Marc Albrighton cross from close range.\n\nLeicester had a couple of half chances in the closing minutes, never looking like causing a shock but threatening a second goal which would have annoyed Van Gaal as much as the crowd, though Di María should really have put the game to bed after bringing down a Rooney pass five minutes from time. With the hard work done, the Argentinian should either have produced a shot on target or squared to the unmarked James Wilson; instead he blazed wastefully into the Stretford End.\n\n“We didn’t manage the ball well enough in the first half,” Nigel Pearson said. “The first goal was offside, which was unhelpful, but it would be wrong of me to spend too much time questioning a single decision when United played so well. These are bonus games for teams like us. Our season will be defined by results against the teams around us.”"}, {"date": "31/01/2015", "arena": "Bet365 Stadium", "attendance": 27512, "home_team": {"name": "Stoke City", "lineup": [{"name":

City.\n\nMark Hughes was upset by the season-ending injury on Monday, in the FA Cup fourth round win at Rochdale, to the man who has quickly become his talisman. However, his side’s response against Queens Park Rangers was as positive as he could have wished, with Walters scoring twice in the first half and then completing a hat-trick in injury time, on his 200th appearance for the club.\n\n“At the end it was fitting that Jon scored his third goal to take the game away from them because I thought on the day he was magnificent and a credit to his profession,” said Hughes.\n\n“I’m just delighted for him – he probably doesn’t get enough credit for what he does on the field of play, and his determination and effort to get everything out of his body and his ability is second to none. I am really pleased for him.”\n\nHarry Redknapp is a veteran of transfer deadline day but you get the impression the QPR manager will have to be constantly on his phone on Monday to help his side avoid the drop.\n\nRangers’ defence was ripped apart in the first half and they were architects of their own downfall.

Rangers were to pull one back almost immediately when Leroy Fer’s ball was crossed in by Joey Barton. Charlie Austin’s shot then ricocheted straight to Niko Kranjcar, who could not miss.\n\nStoke could have been hindered by injury to their captain, Ryan Shawcross, who pulled up attempting to catch Fer in that move. But his exit did not appear to hurt them, with Moses just missing the target from Walters’ lay-off and Phil Bardsley’s free-kick just going over, either side of half-time.\n\nSunderland 2-0 Burnley | Premier League match report Read more\n\nRangers nearly levelled in spectacular fashion after the break but Eduardo Vargas’s acrobatic effort from Fer’s free-kick was well kept out by Asmir Begovic.\n\nThe visitors maintained their fight, with Joey Barton seeing a 30-yard free-kick come back off the crossbar and then Begovic needed to be at his best to keep out another free-kick from Fer as the visitors ensured they at least had some spirit about them.\n\nBut the contest was ended in injury time when Walters reacted quickest to Barton’s attempted clearance, to head his tenth goal of the season.\n\nRedknapp desperately needs to bring in further quality at both ends of the field if his side are to remain in the Premier League for another season but in the little that remains of the transfer window, he is unsure if he will be able to bring in Bakary Sako, the Wolves midfielder, while Emmanuel Adebayor, the Totttenham and former Arsenal forward, has also been mentioned as a potential target.\n\n“It’s hard to get players in, I couldn’t say we definitely will,” he said. “The chairman’s trying and Les Ferdinand’s trying. It’s not easy to find players, especially this late.\n\n“I don’t know where Sako’s gone and I don’t know if Adebayor’s a possibility, I don’t honestly know.

week in which even Gus Poyet conceded his frequently jeered team had been “rubbish to watch” of late, a much-improved performance eased relegation fears on Wearside.\n\nOnly time will tell whether it actually proves the turning point Sunderland’s manager craves but Burnley – and Ings – will need to play much better than this if they are to survive.\n\nHull City 0-3 Newcastle United | Premier League match report Read more\n\n“I’m happy,” said Poyet. “It was a much-needed win. At last we scored two goals from two crosses – but we’re not OK yet, we won a football game, that’s all.”\n\nPoyet abandoned his recent experiment with five at the back, replacing that formation with a broadly 4-3-3 configuration featuring Defoe as the central striker and Connor Wickham and Adam Johnson stationed wide on the right and left, respectively.\n\nAlthough Wickham and Johnson had licence to roam while drifting inwards, this system initially looked alarmingly, deceptively, negative. Indeed Defoe was looking rather isolated when, in the 20th minute, Sunderland created their first real chance and Wickham scored.\n\nWith referee Lee Mason playing advantage, Sebastian Larsson shrugged off a foul and provided Anthony Réveillère with a fine pass. Overlapping from right-back, Réveillère promptly supplied Wickham with a splendid cross which the former England Under-21 striker headed past Tom Heaton.\n\nManchester United 3-1 Leicester City | Premier League match report Read more\n\nBy half-time Defoe had scored his long-awaited first goal in a Sunderland shirt since arriving from Toronto earlier this month. It was an entirely typical finish from the former England striker who, having manoeuvred himself into exactly the right place at the right time, extended his right boot and beat Heaton from close range after connecting with a left-wing cross from the arguably offside Patrick van Aanholt. As Defoe celebrated, Jordi Gómez could reflect on a job well done in picking out Van Aanholt with an audacious precision pass. “I knew Jermain would score,” said Poyet.\n\nThe odd George Boyd cameo aside, Burnley had contributed little – although Ashley Barnes knew he really should have beaten Costel Pantilimon with an early header following David Jones’s free kick.\n\nDespite Defoe missing a relatively simple chance after Johnson’s clever reverse pass and another Van Aanholt cross, Sean Dyche’s side upped their game a little in the second half. Who knows what might have happened had Barnes subsequently done better with an inviting headed chance and a promising shooting opening after being twice set up by Boyd.\n\nInstead we were treated to a rare show of dissent among Burnley ranks. If it came as a surprise to see Dyche replace Boyd with Ross Wallace, his decision to send on Lukas Jutkiewicz in place of the much-coveted, yet almost entirely anonymous, Ings proved somewhat less startling.\n\nIngs, though, seemed rather put out and deliberately avoided eye contact with Burnley’s manager as he trudged off, shaking his head and muttering to himself. It will be interesting to see where the forward is playing this time next week.\n\nDyche remains confident it will be at Turf Moor. “Everyone will tell you Danny will still be a Burnley player,” he said. “It would take an impossible offer for something to happen. I took Danny off because I think it [the transfer speculation] affected him. I’d considered not starting him. It’s all been too much, he’s a young, human, footballer, the good things about his game weren’t there.”\n\nThe same could be said of a few team-mates. “We didn’t have the edge, the clarity and the moments of quality you need to win matches,” agreed Dyche. “The edge we normally have came back in the second half but, by then, we’d made it easy for Sunderland by giving away two awful goals.”"},

the battle of the young England strikers as he became the first Tottenham Hotspur player to reach 20 goals in a season since Gareth Bale and helped Mauricio Pochettino’s team pull within two points of the top four in the Premier League.\n\nThe Londoner scored twice in another excellent performance full of vim and invention and should be a shoo-in for a first senior call-up next month when England face Lithuania in a Euro 2016 qualifier, and Italy. .\n\nTony Pulis said Berahino still has some way to go to match the appetite and the level that Kane has reached and this was clearly illustrated at The Hawthorns where the Spurs striker’s two goals made him the leading Premier League scorer in all competitions.\n\nTottenham, who face Chelsea at Wembley on 1 March after surviving a scare at the hands of Sheffield United in the Capital One Cup semi-final on Wednesday, have now won six of their last eight Premier League games after they ended West Brom’s unbeaten start under Pulis.\n\nBut if there is a good day to lose this may have been it for Albion. Five of their six rivals around them also suffered and even Sunderland winning could be deemed good news for those battling relegation because it meant defeat for Burnley.\n\nHugo Lloris, the Spurs goalkeeper and captain, was outstanding in the spell after Christian Eriksen and Kane had presented West Brom with a two-goal deficit to chase and Mauricio Pochettino acknowledged his team had needed to start well.\n\n“After the semi-final against Sheffield United it was difficult but I think from the beginning we were aggressive and played well with and without the ball,” the Spurs manager said.\n\nHe paid tribute not only to Kane’s goals and form but to his attitude. “His was a great performance and whenever a striker scores goals it is good for the team,” Pochettino said. “My focus is always that a player can improve –he is young and they need to show that they want to improve.\n\n“You can never stop your improvement but it was not only him, all the players showed character.”\n\nHe refused to look too far ahead, to the possibility of qualifying for the Champions League.\n\n“If we show like we show today, this performance, maybe we have the possibility to get there but we need to be consistent from here to the end of the season.”\n\nSpurs came from 3-0 down to gain a point at The Hawthorns last season but they did not have to work very hard to gain a two-goal advantage.\n\nPulis has been rebuilding this West Brom side on a “brutal” regime of hard work but the manner in which they capitulated in the opening quarter of an hour made it look as if they had decided to have a day off.\n\nCrystal Palace 0-1 Everton | Premier League match report Read more\n\nWith a copy of the goal he scored at Bramall Lane in midweek to clinch Spurs’ 3-2 aggregate win in the semi-final, Eriksen curled a free-kick into the top corner in the sixth minute after Claudio Yacob had fouled Moussa Dembélé. Then before West Brom had mustered so much as an attack Kane, receiving Dembélé’s pass out wide, stepped inside Andre Wisdom with ease before smacking his shot beyond Ben Foster.\n\nWest Brom, seeking to extend a five-game unbeaten sequence since Alan Irvine’s departure, rallied and had Hugo Lloris not been in such brilliant form they could have regained a foothold in the match.\n\nBut Lloris tipped over James Morrison’s exquisite chip and parried Yacob’s close-range effort before Craig Dawson headed against the crossbar.\n\nWhen Kevin Friend adjudged that Joleon Lescott had deliberately handballed as he slid to block Kyle Walker’s cross on the overlap, the home side knew this was not going to be their day. Kane dispatched the penalty with his customary confidence.\n\nWest Brom went for broke, introducing Brown Ideye into a three-pronged attack, but Craig Gardner struck an effort against the post as Spurs held firm.\n\n“We started sloppy,” Pulis said, “and handed them a two-goal lead. We needed a goal but their keeper was absolutely fantastic.

Apparently it was the fault of Jamie Redknapp and all the other rotters in the media that Diego Costa was suspended and Mourinho, in turn, was applying his own ban. It is a siege mentality at Stamford Bridge right now and it is tempting to think they might have boarded up the pressbox and dismantled the television gantry if Manchester City had made the most of their superiority.\n\nAs it turned out, Costa was not too badly missed bearing in mind his replacement, Loïc Rémy, scored Chelsea’a goal. Yet they did badly miss Cesc Fàbregas given the way City’s midfield operated with the greater control. It was a strangely dishevelled performance from the league leaders and City had enough of the ball to feel like they ought to have darkened Mourinho’s mood even more.\n\nChelsea’s squad leaves doubts but Manchester City could learn from their hard noses | Jacob Steinberg Read more\n\nManuel Pellegrini’s side could not add to David Silva’s equaliser but they should head back to Manchester feeling encouraged by the pattern of the game and what it said, after 87 minutes, when Mourinho signalled for Remy to come off and brought on Gary Cahill to strengthen their lines of defence. In that moment Chelsea’s manager had virtually abandoned the idea of going for a winner and settled on keeping out a late City onslaught.\n\nHis team survived but when a game between first and second ends this way it does serve as a reminder that City, as their fans like to sing, will fight to the end of this title race.\n\nThey were certainly the more rounded team and it was unusual, to say the least, to see Chelsea with home advantage being pinned back into their own half. On other occasions there was a level of carelessness that must have startled Mourinho. Silva’s goal was a calamity for Thibaut Courtois but it was not the only occasion when normally dependable players made individual mistakes in and around their penalty area and it was strange to see such an accomplished group of footballers being so generous.\n\nSergio Agüero provides the guile to keep Manchester City in title chase | Barney Ronay Read more\n\nChelsea, to give them their due, did start to cut out the defensive lapses as the game went on but they needed to because their opponents were throwing everything at them in those stages and, if anything, seemed encouraged by the message that Mourinho’s Rémy-Cahill switch sent out.\n\nJesús Navas had their first effort saved by Courtois after only 17 seconds and Pellegrini was entitled to be disappointed his side could not be more ruthless bearing in mind they had a number of chances at 0-0 and the best of the play in the second half without being able to put together a really inviting opportunity.\n\nChelsea had set out like a team that was reluctant to blur the lines between adventure and leaving themselves open to the counterattack and, by the end, it was a full-on backs-to-the-walls operation. “Boring, boring Chelsea,” the away end sang, along with various other uncomplimentary chants about Mourinho’s tactics. Yet City should also feel aggrieved with themselves because, on the balance of play, there is no doubt it was a missed opportunity.\n\nJosé Mourinho facing Premier League punishment after press blackout Read more\n\nAt one point early on, Nemanja Matic lost the ball to Fernandinho and was fortunate the Brazilian’s shot was deflected behind for a corner. Sergio Agüero had a chance not long afterwards that originated from James Milner dispossessing Branislav Ivanovic and Pellegrini will also reflect on that moment, just after the half-hour, when John Terry misread the trajectory of a long ball from Vincent Kompany. Agüero was free but pulled his shot wide and, despite their dominance in the second half, City did not get a chance of that nature again.\n\nChelsea opened the scoring with virtually their first attack of real penetration and the goal was a personal ordeal for Bacary Sagna given that Pellegrini had trusted him with the job of subduing Eden Hazard on the left of Chelsea’s attack. Sagna might be marginally quicker than City’s usual right-back, Pablo Zabaleta, but the Argentinian is a better natural defender and it showed when Ivanovic picked out his team-mate.\n\nPremier League: Chelsea v Manchester City – in pictures Read more\n\nSagna had switched off and Hazard returned the ball, first-time, across the six-yard area. Kompany withdrew his leg at the crucial moment, perhaps fearing that he might turn the ball into his own goal, and in hindsight he probably should have taken the risk with Rémy lurking behind him to fire past Joe Hart.\n\nWhat followed was unusual bearing in mind Chelsea’s reputation – Bradford City aside – as the best team in the country at holding on to a lead. On this occasion it lasted only four minutes and featured the first major mistake from Courtois since his return to his parent club from Atlético Madrid. Milner’s presence might have distracted the goalkeeper as he came to punch Navas’s right-wing cross but it was not a valid excuse for completely missing the ball. Agüero, as usual, was loitering with intent and swung his left foot at the ball. The shot was going wide but Silva was there to apply the decisive touch inside the six-yard area.\n\nAfter the interval, it was rare to see Chelsea being pinned inside their own half. Milner and Navas impressed on the wings. Fernandinho and Fernando made Yaya Touré’s absence not feel important and Mourinho became so agitated it required a tête-à-tête with Mark Clattenburg on the touchline. Mourinho seems permanently dissatisfied with the refereeing kingdom but Clattenburg officiated the game impressively and it was not his fault – or the fourth official Jon Moss – that Chelsea did not pass the ball with more authority.\n\nPellegrini sent on Frank Lampard to face his old club but Mourinho had ensured there were an awful lot of bodies to get through."}, {"date": "19/01/2015",

when asked by Sylvester Stallone to provide a crowd scene for his next boxing film during half-time. Dissent was in the air otherwise, within and around Roberto Martínez’s team, and their Premier League status will indeed be Rocky should this form continue.\n\nWest Bromwich Albion were as resilient as Tony Pulis demanded in keeping a third consecutive clean sheet under their new manager and Everton predictably short of solutions. Martínez’s decision to withdraw Muhamed Besic, his team’s liveliest spark, prompted a chorus of boos, so too the final whistle, while patience snapped with Ross Barkley for overplaying it more than Stallone himself. But the Everton manager’s problems ran deeper.\n\nKevin Mirallas missed a first-half penalty having taken the ball from the regular taker, Leighton Baines, and ignored requests from several team-mates to hand it back. The subject of interest from Tottenham Hotspur, Borussia Dortmund and Atlético Madrid then failed to reappear for the second half – a recurrence of a persistent hamstring problem, according to Martínez, who attempted to play down Mirallas’s individualism, claimed Besic was injured and praised Barkley for his perseverance against a well-drilled, tireless Albion rearguard. It was the defence a manager has to launch after one win in 13 matches, one win in 10 league games, and with ominous fixtures on the horizon and Goodison starting to turn. Martínez and his team are lurching towards trouble.\n\nEverton have a serious problem when expected or allowed to take the game to their opponents. Against the champions Manchester City in their previous home game, and when trailing with 10 men to West Ham United in the FA Cup, they showed the intensity, aggression and movement to break down defences. When confronted by a side content to sit back and absorb pressure, however, they repeatedly struggle to find a way through. This fell into the latter category.\n\nPulis sought to nullify Everton’s threat from the full-back positions with a five-man midfield containing Chris Brunt on the right and Saido Berahino on the left while flooding forward on the counterattack. Everton’s reliance on shots from distance in a first half they dominated, having 88% possession inside the opening 15 minutes alone, reflected another Pulis job well done.\n\nBen Foster had only long-range efforts to contend with before the home side were awarded a penalty shortly before the interval. Baines and Mirallas, with a 25-yard drive and a free-kick towards the top corner, were unable to stretch the Albion goalkeeper.\n\nRomelu Lukaku was isolated as the focal point of Everton’s attack as Barkley, Steven Naismith and Mirallas failed to provide close support but, with Goodison growing restless, Martínez’s men were given a glorious opportunity when Joleon Lescott handled inside his own area. The chance appeared to have gone when Lukaku chested Seamus Coleman’s cross at the feet of the former Everton defender but the ball bounced awkwardly on to Lescott’s outstretched arm and the referee, Michael Oliver, had no hesitation in pointing to the spot. It was the fifth penalty that Oliver has awarded Everton at Goodison in five matches.\n\nBaines, with 15 successful spot-kicks from 16 in the Premier League, stepped forward but Mirallas took the ball from him, ignored instructions from Lukaku and Naismith to let the left-back take it and made matters worse by dragging his penalty wide. Martínez shook his head in disbelief.\n\nAlbion had chances to heighten Everton’s anxiety but Andre Wisdom just failed to connect with James Morrison’s inviting ball into the box and Craig Gardner was marginally offside when forcing Joel Robles into his first save of the night.\n\nEverton increased their tempo and the number of crosses into the visitors’ area after the interval, to the obvious benefit of Lukaku, but chances remained at a premium. Besic went close from distance and Lukaku fired over at the end of a rare flowing move but the threat diminished in the second half, in contrast to Martínez’s problems."}, {"date": "18/01/2015", "arena": "Upton Park", "attendance": 34914, "home_team": {"name": "West Ham United", "lineup": [{"name": "Adrián", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Carl Jenkinson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Collins", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [49]}, {"name": "James Tomkins", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [76]}, {"name": "Aaron Cresswell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mark Noble", "yellows": [21], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [66]}, {"name": "Alex Song", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stewart Downing", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [72], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin Nolan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Enner Valencia", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andy Carroll", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [49], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Winston Reid", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [49], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matthew Jarvis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joey O'Brien", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [76], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Morgan Amalfitano", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [69], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [66], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jussi Jaaskelainen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Diego Poyet", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Carlton Cole", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Hull City", "lineup": [{"name": "Allan McGregor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Dawson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex Bruce", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Curtis Davies", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [72]}, {"name": "James Chester", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Jake Livermore", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Huddlestone", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Meyler", "yellows": [87], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ahmed Elmohamady", "yellows": [34], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stephen Quinn", "yellows": [75], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sone Aluko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Maynor Figueroa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Maguire", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paul McShane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yannick Sagbo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [72], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steve Harper", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Ince", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gaston Ramirez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "At the interval, as the Upton Park crowd booed and torpor reigned supreme, it was easy to think of the same fixture last season. Back in March West Ham United beat 10-man Hull City but the dissatisfaction at the performance was so strong that they were jeered by the home support at half-time and full-time. A disbelieving Sam Allardyce infamously cupped his hand to his ear in the face of the criticism.\n\nThe club is happier these days and this result seemed an appropriate barometer of the progress. Though the team were dismal in the opening 45 minutes, they showed character and quality to respond with three well-taken goals which deepened the woes of Steve Bruce and Hull.\n\nThe stellar moment was provided by the substitute Morgan Amalfitano who took Enner Valencia’s pass and, one-on-one with the goalkeeper Allan McGregor, executed a glorious dinked finish. Andy Carroll had unlocked the stalemate and, when Stewart Downing ran on to Alex Song’s through-ball to score the third, Hull had that familiar sinking feeling. They have lost 10 of their last 14 matches.\n\nHull had shaded the first half and Bruce felt that, with better final passes, they might have been able to count between six and eight chances. That was a bit of an exaggeration but there was no doubting the clarity of Ahmed Elmohamady’s early chance, which he blew wastefully.\n\nAllardyce changed things at half-time, switching to a diamond midfield and telling his players to get the ball forward more quickly. “All this tippy-tappy stuff everyone keeps going on about as being the right way to play football – it’s all a load of old bollocks sometimes,” the West Ham manager said.\n\nWhat was alarming was how Hull caved in after Carroll’s goal. They have a two-week break before their next game – at home to Newcastle – and it is plain Bruce has a job on his hands to stop the slide.\n\nSteve Bruce names and shames Hull players after defeat at West Ham Read more\n\nAllardyce described West Ham’s first-half showing as “lethargic” and their passing as being as poor as he had seen it all season. He put the slow start down to a hangover from last Tuesday’s penalty shootout win over Everton in the FA Cup and they were lucky not to concede here.\n\nElmohamady’s opportunity was the sort that relegation-threatened teams have to take and, when he dragged it wide from Sone Aluko’s low cut-back, it always seemed Hull would regret it. They had other first-half flickers, with Aluko skipping into the area on a couple of occasions. On the second he ought to have shot, rather than pass to Jake Livermore, who was crowded out.\n\nIt was thud and blunder, with West Ham edging it in the first-half error stakes. Adrián cleared straight to David Meyler, almost presenting him with a chance, and the home crowd growled when first Mark Noble and Valencia and later Carroll and Aaron Cresswell banged into each other.\n\nWest Ham almost pinched the lead in the 42nd minute when Valencia looped a header against the bar and James Tomkins forced McGregor to save after the ball had been recycled. But it was a different game after the break, with Allardyce’s team tweaked and more dynamic. Kevin Nolan lashed over the bar from the edge of the box after Downing’s cross before Carroll supplied the breakthrough. McGregor will not enjoy the inquest and nor will Curtis Davies. Valencia’s shot from 25 yards was well struck but the goalkeeper appeared to be in the right position only to bat the ball back out centrally. Carroll reacted more quickly than Davies to tap home his fifth of an injury-truncated season.\n\nBruce lost James Chester and Alex Bruce to a dislocated shoulder and thigh strain respectively and, as he held back his third substitution early in the second half, he briefly pushed the centre-half Harry Maguire up as a makeshift centre-forward. He moved him back when he introduced Yannick Sagbo up front and it was just in time for Maguire to be one of those giving forlorn chase to Downing on the third goal.\n\nValencia had almost capitalised on a dreadful Michael Dawson pass at 1-0 and Nolan was denied by the post late on. The reality for Hull was that it could have been worse. Allardyce said the home crowd had been “caught cold” during the first half after the elation of the win over Everton. There were hearty cheers from them at full-time.\n\nMan of the match Enner Valencia (West Ham United)"}, {"date": "18/01/2015", "arena": "Etihad Stadium", "attendance": 45596, "home_team": {"name": "Manchester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Joe Hart", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pablo Zabaleta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Vincent Kompany", "yellows": [41], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martín Demichelis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gael Clichy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fernandinho", "yellows": [54], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [63]}, {"name": "Fernando", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jesus Navas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [76]}, {"name": "David Silva", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Milner", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Sergio Agüero", "yellows": [86], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Bacary Sagna", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Edin Dzeko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [76], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aleksandar Kolarov", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willy Caballero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Frank Lampard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [63], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eliaquim Mangala", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stevan Jovetic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Arsenal", "lineup": [{"name": "David Ospina", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Hector Bellerin", "yellows": [56], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Per Mertesacker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Laurent Koscielny", "yellows": [3], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nacho Monreal", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Francis Coquelin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [66]}, {"name": "Aaron Ramsey", "yellows": [38], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [84]}, {"name": "Santi Cazorla", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [24], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alexis Sánchez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [84]}, {"name": "Olivier Giroud", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [67], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Wojciech Szczesny", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kieran Gibbs", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [84], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tomas Rosicky", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [66], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mesut Özil", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Theo Walcott", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mathieu Flamini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [84], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Calum Chambers", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "The only possible complaint against Arsenal is that they do not do this more often. Arsène Wenger’s side have been regarded as a soft touch for longer than they will want to remember against the top sides and then they show up at the home of the champions and play in a way that makes it seem bewildering that their own title challenge has already turned to dust.\n\nIt has certainly been a long time since Arsenal have taken on one of the elite and played with the greater sense of togetherness, the better work-rate and more effective tactics. They sieved six goals here last season and their record in Manchester has been appalling since the sun started to fade on the Wenger years, featuring only one point out of a possible 21 before this fixture and a goal difference of minus 21.\n\nYet they played with a level of wit and gumption that has become rare among visiting teams to this ground. Santi Cazorla’s performance, combining high skill and indefatigable running, could have been set to music and, in the process, he and his team-mates blew a gaping hole in City’s aspirations of making it three titles in four seasons.\n\nManuel Pellegrini’s team tend to spiral into this kind of carelessness only when they hear the Champions League anthem and they had better snap out of it quickly bearing in mind their next league game is at Chelsea. There was a dishevelled look about the beaten side, out-run and out-thought by a team that took the lead through Cazorla’s 24th-minute penalty, doubled it with Olivier Giroud’s header midway through the second half and defended throughout with the nerve and conviction that has been so conspicuously absent when Wenger’s teams have capitulated in other high-level assignments over the last few years.\n\nFrancis Coquelin’s Arsenal masterclass: tactical triumph or just lucky? Read more\n\nNot too long ago this kind of rearguard action from Per Mertesacker, for instance, would have been inconceivable. Cazorla delivered a masterclass in midfield, always wanting the ball and having the supreme football intelligence to know what best to do with it. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain was another huge influence while Aaron Ramsey and Alexis Sánchez also helped to ensure that Arsenal overwhelmed their opponents in midfield.\n\nCity badly missed Yaya Touré, on international duty at the Africa Cup of Nations, and have not won a league match since last April when he has been missing. The bad news for Pellegrini is that Touré will also be missing when they head to Stamford Bridge at the end of the month.\n\nCity will not be able to get away with defending this shabbily against José Mourinho’s team. Martín Demichelis set the tone with two basic errors early on to give away the ball in his own half. The way Pablo Zabaleta lost a 50-50 challenge with Ramsey in the build-up to Cazorla’s penalty was unusual in the extreme and the defending for Giroud’s goal was even worse.\n\nFernando lost his man in the penalty area but not a single defender reacted when Cazorla chipped his free-kick into the six-yard box. Giroud was the only one who showed any real intent and glanced his header past the exposed Joe Hart.\n\nArsenal chased after everything. They were quick to the ball, strong in the tackle, crowding out David Silva and providing a near-impenetrable barrier in front of David Ospina’s goal. It was not until the 36th minute that City managed a shot at goal and the people who keep these statistics were quickly out with the information that had not happened in a league game here since October 2012. The last time City lost one at home by two goals? Go back two more years.\n\nOspina barely had to get a scuff of mud on his kit and Francis Coquelin demonstrated again that he is better suited for the defensive midfield role than Mikel Arteta. Coquelin is relatively new to the side but at one point he could be seen bellowing at his team-mates, demanding they did not lower their standards.\n\nPellegrini, in stark contrast, should be startled by the way that kind of leadership was missing from the home side. City’s manager complained afterwards that the penalty was unjust bearing in mind the minimal contact from Vincent Kompany on Nacho Monreal. Yet the City captain was silly to take the risk, leaning towards his opponent and away from the ball, and, however much disguise he tried to apply, the referee, Mike Dean, judged it well.\n\nMonreal had played a give-and-go with Giroud and Kompany, at his best, would have anticipated the danger. He looked rusty, returning from injury, and Pellegrini did admit it was unnecessary for Kompany to make the body movement towards his opponent.\n\nSergio Agüero likewise looked short of sharpness after his injury lay-off but the truth is that the service to him was generally poor. Jesús Navas is still unable to exert a huge influence on matches and James Milner did not last beyond half-time.\n\nBriefly, there were some encouraging signs for City early in the first half and another possible feat of escapology when Frank Lampard was brought on as a second-half substitute. Giroud’s header killed that idea stone-dead and a crowd that likes to sing to the team “fight to the end” had started to disperse with 10 minutes to go.\n\nMan of the match Santi Cazorla (Arsenal)"},

said they have lost their sense of humour. “We’ll score again, don’t know where, don’t know when,” was being chorused at the end, as the wait for a league goal stretched to a remarkable eight hours and 42 minutes.\n\nThe proposed protest in the Holte End never materialised; the stand was full at kick-off and nothing of note happened in the eighth minute – or at any other stage of the game – though a few boos were audible at the end of both halves. “A goal was the only thing that was missing,” said Paul Lambert, the Villa manager, somewhat optimistically. “Their goalkeeper had a great second half. If we keep doing what we are doing the goals will come.”\n\nBrendan Rodgers did not entirely disagree. “Simon Mignolet was outstanding,” he said. “He wasn’t overworked but, when called upon, he made two great saves. That must have been frustrating for Paul, but maybe we could have had one or two more goals as well.”\n\nLiverpool should really have been two up by the interval – Raheem Sterling inexplicably squandering a great chance after the Villa defence evaporated to leave him one on one with Brad Guzan – but one goal is usually enough against opponents who have now failed to find the net in their past five league games.\n\nFabio Borini, starting up front because Mario Balotelli was unavailable through illness, tucked away a Jordan Henderson cross at the far post to overcome a goal drought of his own and put Liverpool in front after 24 minutes. From that point onwards, the visitors never looked like being in trouble. They did double their lead from a wealth of chances created in the second half but a single goal would have sufficed. That is why Aston Villa supporters are so exasperated.\n\nLiverpool had a goal disallowed for offside before the interval, an over-anxious Borini shot high over the bar shortly after scoring, and Guzan was grateful to save Sterling’s tame effort, while the home side passed the ball around midfield without giving Mignolet anything to do until the 40th minute. When Villa did produce their first shot on target, it was straight at the goalkeeper from Carlos Sánchez, though Mignolet did have to work a little harder just before half-time when Tom Cleverley broke clear. The Belgian left his line quickly and Lazar Markovic recovered well enough to put Cleverley off in the act of shooting, in what amounted to Villa’s only real opening of the first 45 minutes.\n\nLambert keeps pleading for patience but his players need to be a little more proactive. They did not respond in any discernible way to going a goal behind, and did not appear to have any sort of plan to get back into the game other than sending Alan Hutton down the right to cross for Christian Benteke, a thankless task when up against a wing-back of Alberto Moreno’s pace.\n\nLiverpool kept up their attacking threat in the second half, Henderson forcing a fine save from Guzan after the goalkeeper had tipped a header from Martin Skrtel on to a post, though Benteke did at least generate some noise from the Holte End with a shot on the turn that Mignolet did well to keep out.\n\nThat – along with Lambert sending on Andreas Weimann and Carles Gil, the latter a new acquisition from Valencia – seemed to wake up a somnolent stadium a little, though Liverpool were still doing more of the attacking and Borini’s finish was wasteful when Moreno found him with a cross from the right.\n\nNathan Baker headed narrowly over from a corner and Mignolet saved again from Benteke, as Villa enjoyed a brief period of attacking fluency midway through the second half, but, when the ball fell invitingly for Baker in front of goal, the defender scuffed his shot.\n\nLiverpool were not to be denied, however, and quickly weathered that mini storm. Guzan tipped a shot from Lucas Leiva around a post to concede a corner and, though Fabian Delph had a good chance to clear, he instead gave the ball away to Sterling, who deftly supplied Rickie Lambert for a cool finish from the edge of the area.\n\nThe Holte End fell silent again before the end, with just the travelling fans in the Doug Ellis stand making themselves heard, gleefully highlighting the fact that Liverpool had accomplished this victory without the injured Steven Gerrard.\n\nWhile Villa have a chance to reacquaint themselves with the art of goalscoring in the FA Cup against Bournemouth, next week, a barren spell of five Premier League matches is not what you need when your next two opponents are Arsenal and Chelsea. Lambert received the loyalty he wanted from the Villa supporters on this occasion, though everyone connected with the club knows it is time to give something back in return."}, {"date": "17/01/2015", "arena": "Turf Moor", "attendance": 17782, "home_team": {"name": "Burnley", "lineup": [{"name": "Tom Heaton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kieran Trippier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Keane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jason Shackell", "yellows": [61], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Mee", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [12], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "George Boyd", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Dean Marney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Jones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Scott Arfield", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Barnes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [73]}, {"name": "Danny Ings", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [16], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Michael Duff", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ross Wallace", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sam Vokes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [73], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Kightly", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marvin Sordell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Reid", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matthew Gilks", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Crystal Palace", "lineup": [{"name": "Julian Speroni", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joel Ward", "yellows": [77], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Scott Dann", "yellows": [17], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Damien Delaney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Kelly", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [83]}, {"name": "Jason Puncheon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [48], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James McArthur", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Ledley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wilfried Zaha", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [70]}, {"name": "Yaya Sanogo", "yellows": [74], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [79]}, {"name": "Dwight Gayle", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [28, 87], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Adrian Mariappa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [83], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Brede Hangeland", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adlene Guedioura", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [70], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fraizer Campbell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wayne Hennessey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jerome Thomas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Glenn Murray", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [79], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Alan Pardew’s reign at Selhurst Park is only 16 days old but history has already repeated itself. That, like much else that has happened this month, is something Crystal Palace can celebrate. For the second successive week, they trailed and had the character and quality to transform defeat into victory. Once again, Dwight Gayle and Jason Puncheon were the scorers. And, as he had done seven days earlier, Pardew exerted a catalytic impact.\n\nTottenham were sunk partly because he brought on Adlène Guedioura for Barry Bannan. Burnley were beaten following a rapid rethink after Pardew recognised his initial tactics were failing. A reshuffle brought a revival and a remarkable turnaround. Pardew, rarely one for false modesty, could be excused for arguing it was the turning point. Certainly the Palace fans needed little persuading. No sooner had Puncheon levelled than they chorused: “Alan Pardew is one of our own.” Newcastle supporters rarely voiced such sentiments but his has been a happy homecoming.\n\n“So far, it is going really well,” said Pardew. If anything, that is an understatement: he still has a 100 per cent record. Yet if Palace’s new era has begun brilliantly, there was an anachronistic feel to a Premier League game where both teams opted to play 4-4-2, where 20 of the 22 starters were British or Irish and where the snow on the Pennine hills provided a picturesque backdrop.\n\nBut Burnley fared better with the old-fashioned formation, surging into a two-goal lead. “We didn’t get a grip in midfield at the start,” Pardew said. “We changed.” Plan B worked far better. Gayle moved to the left wing, Wilfried Zaha switched to the right and Puncheon was deployed infield. They proved the three most influential players on the pitch thereafter.\n\n“We had to show tremendous qualities,” added Pardew, stressing their footballing skills. “We had the flair and bravery to pass the ball.” They were ready, too, to run at Burnley. Zaha was the instigator of the fightback, tormenting Ben Mee. Burnley failed to clear his menacing cross and Gayle drilled in a shot from 10 yards to halve the deficit. Had Kieran Trippier not made a goal-saving intervention, a second Zaha centre would have given Yaya Sanogo a debut goal. The on-loan Arsenal striker came close, too, when Scott Arfield hooked his goal-bound header away.\n\nInstead, Puncheon equalised with a low drive after veering infield. The game’s fifth and final goal doubled up as a six-pointer. Both threatened. James McArthur, a summer transfer target of Burnley’s, cleared Michael Keane’s half-volley off the line and the Palace substitute Glenn Murray rattled the post with a volley.\n\nBut Burnley had squandered a two-goal lead to lose against Tottenham on Wednesday and history repeated itself for them, too, with another unpleasant ending. “I did not feel comfortable how we were performing, even with a 2-0 lead,” said Sean Dyche. “It was unusual. We looked slightly off. One per cent off the performance level is too much at this level.”\n\nPuncheon punished them, delivering the cross that Gayle drilled in for his fourth goal in three games under Pardew. “He is a very uncomplicated player: quick, good in the air and has two [good] feet,” said the manager. “Blimey, there’s not much more you want, is there?”\n\nGayle’s double meant Palace, who had failed to score in their previous four away league games, struck three times. “That is not in my memory bank,” said Pardew. “That is sometimes the benefit of a new manager.”\n\nPalace are poster boys for change, Burnley the division’s great advocates of continuity. They set a Premier League record by fielding the same starting 11 for an eighth consecutive game.\n\nThe only element of novelty came on the scoresheet. Ben Mee struck for the first time in the top flight when he headed in Trippier’s corner after Julián Speroni was stranded in no-man’s land. Then Danny Ings scored coolly after Scott Arfield outmuscled Joel Ward. “It was a foul,” said Pardew. “The ball wasn’t in the quadrant for the first but that is a lame excuse. We should have done better.”\n\nFor once, the same might be said of Burnley. Dyche was not too despondent. “Remember, most people thought we would need snookers by now,” he said. But context seemed scant consolation to his players."}, {"date": "17/01/2015", "arena": "The King Power Stadium", "attendance": 31772, "home_team": {"name": "Leicester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Ben Hamer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Simpson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marcin Wasilewski", "yellows": [19], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wes Morgan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paul Konchesky", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Anthony Knockaert", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Drinkwater", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andy King", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jeffrey Schlupp", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [71]}, {"name": "Jamie Vardy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [65]}, {"name": "David Nugent", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [71]}], "subs": [{"name": "Andrej Kramaric", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [65], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ritchie de Laet", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marc Albrighton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Lawrence", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [71], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Liam Moore", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leonardo Ulloa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [71], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mark Schwarzer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Stoke City", "lineup": [{"name": "Asmir Begovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Bardsley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Philipp Wollscheid", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marc Muniesa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marc Wilson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Glenn Whelan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven N'Zonzi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marko Arnautovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [81]}, {"name": "Bojan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [63], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Moses", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [86]}, {"name": "Jon Walters", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Robert Huth", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stephen Ireland", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charlie Adam", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Geoff Cameron", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [86], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steve Sidwell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Butland", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Peter Crouch", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [81], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Where Barcelona, Roma, Milan and Ajax failed, Stoke City appear to be succeeding in allowing the remarkable footballing talent that is Bojan Krkic to flourish. Whether it is a relative lack of pressure, or simply maturity on the part of a player once hailed as the next Lionel Messi, and who as a 17-year-old scored the winning goal in a Champions’ League quarter-final, who can say? But Stoke City’s manager, Mark Hughes, is not inclined to complain.\n\n“He’s getting better every game,” said Hughes, after Bojan, now 24, scored his fourth goal in seven games to cap a match-winning performance against the Premier League’s bottom team.\n\n“The Premier League is a strong league, and initially he was a little bit taken aback by that,” Hughes continued. “We had to wait a little bit, but now he’s enjoying being part of a good team. I think he’s thriving in the environment. In the last two or three years he possibly hasn’t felt too wanted, but that’s not the case with him here.”\n\nBojan’s quality on the ball stood out in a game high on endeavour, but low on goalmouth incident. As a result he was kicked from pillar to post, by Marcin Wasilewski in particular, but each time got up without fuss.\n\n“He’s a game little chap, he’s got a great centre of gravity, really low, and teams will try and stop him, because he’s a creative talent, but he’s got great ability, he plays with his head up, and I’ve been really impressed by his personality,” said Hughes. “Given his career path, some players heads would be turned by that, but he’s got great humility and is a good professional.”\n\nIt is certainly hard to believe he cost Stoke just £800,000, and the manner in which he took his goal, finding a yard of space on the edge of the City penalty area, turning, and in the same movement, firing a firm, precise shot into the far corner of the goal, summed up his contribution.\n\nLeicester huffed and puffed manfully, as they always do, but Anthony Knockaert could not take their best opportunity, shooting straight at Asmir Begovic in the Stoke goal, after being picked out by Jeffrey Schlupp’s cross from the left. At the other end it took a fine save from Ben Hamer to prevent Steven N’Zonzi’s powerful volley putting Stoke ahead shortly before Bojan’s clinical finish to win the game.\n\n“We looked dangerous at times, but we didn’t really carve out enough meaningful chances in what was a tight game,” said the Leicester manager, Nigel Pearson. “Most games like that end up in a draw, but it was a bit of quality that won it for them in the end.”"}, {"date": "17/01/2015", "arena": "Kiyan Prince Foundation Stadium", "attendance": 18098, "home_team": {"name": "Queens Park Rangers", "lineup": [{"name":

"There was a red devil on the badge. But there was rarely any devilment about their football. They wore red shirts and black shorts. But they rarely resembled Manchester United. Not the free-flowing, swaggering Manchester United we were accustomed to watching when Sir Alex Ferguson was their manager, anyway. The current version is rather more humdrum, even though they are still on course for a return to the Champions League.\n\nLouis van Gaal will not be fooled by this victory over struggling Queens Park Rangers. United remain an extremely expensive work in progress and QPR’s fight was only snuffed out by James Wilson’s goal in stoppage time.\n\nOnly then could United relax. It was far closer than the scoreline suggests and QPR can take encouragement from a high-energy, bustling performance, even though they are 19th and winless since 20 December. David de Gea had to make a couple of outstanding saves for United when the game was in the balance, and if QPR can play like this every week, then those persistent rumours about Harry Redknapp losing his job will surely fade away.\n\nWhat swung the game in United’s favour was Van Gaal swallowing his pride and switching to a diamond system early in the second half. United did not have a shot on target in last Sunday’s 1-0 defeat against Southampton and there have been calls for Van Gaal to dispense with playing three men at the back, which does not appear to suit his players.\n\nVan Gaal was not deterred by the criticism initially and United were set up in a curious 3-3-2-2 formation from the start, with Antonio Valencia and Daley Blind playing as wing-backs, Michael Carrick sitting, Wayne Rooney and Juan Mata further forward and Ángel Di María alongside Radamel Falcao at the tip of the attack. The idea behind playing Di Maria so high, Van Gaal explained, was so he could stretch QPR with his pace, but United were a convoluted mess for much of the first half and the away end was verging on mutiny as chants of “4-4-2” and “Attack! Attack! Attack!” floated through the west London air. United were sterile in possession, the ball was given away with monotonous regularity in dangerous positions and their muddled thinking was encapsulated by the sight of Phil Jones taking a couple of corners and Neil Swarbrick, the referee, penalising Antonio Valencia for a foul throw.\n\nIt was schoolboy stuff and United were fortunate not to be behind at the break. They were indebted to De Gea after he made a couple of outstanding saves to deny Charlie Austin, first when he parried a looping volley from the QPR striker and then when he arced backwards and tipped a 30-yard drive over the bar. Eduardo Vargas also dropped a header on to the roof of the net after muscular forward play from Bobby Zamora, who was causing problems for United with his strength and hold-up play.\n\nUnited’s most incisive moment of the first half came when Mata’s curling pass reached Falcao in the QPR area and a goal looked inevitable as the Colombian brought the ball down on his chest and prepared to shoot.\n\nYet what followed was a reminder of why Van Gaal left Falcao out entirely against Southampton and has said that he has plenty to do to prove that he is worthy of making his loan move from Monaco permanent. Falcao’s first effort lacked subtlety, the ball hammered straight at Green, and his follow-up was diverted behind by the QPR goalkeeper.\n\nVan Gaal had concerns besides Falcao, however, and he replaced the ineffective Mata with Marouane Fellaini at half-time. Then, when Wilson came on for Jonny Evans, United had four men in defence, a diamond in midfield and Di María behind two strikers. QPR, meanwhile, had lost Richard Dunne to a groin injury. Steven Caulker came on.\n\nUnited had players in their proper positions and, lo and behold, they scored. Green had already made a stunning save from a Falcao header, but his resistance was broken by Fellaini just before the hour. Rooney slid a pass to Valencia on the right and the Ecuadorian broke with tradition by finding a red shirt with his cross for once. It reached Fellaini in the middle of QPR’s area and it was the power of his rising right-footed shot that was too much for Green.\n\nThere were a few anxious moments for United to endure. An awful mix-up between Marcos Rojo and Carrick let Vargas in, only for the Chilean to dither, and De Gea denied Mauricio Isla near the end.\n\nQPR poured men forward in their desperate search for an equaliser and United pounced. Di María released Wilson and although Green saved the 19-year-old’s first effort, he could do nothing about the rebound and United could relax."}, {"date": "17/01/2015", "arena": "The Liberty

clear at the top of the Premier League by inflicting on Swansea one of their worst defeats since they arrived at elite level in 2011. Only Liverpool had previously scored five against them.\n\nThe outcome was settled before half-time, by which stage Chelsea led 4-0, with their fans chanting the name of Diego Costa, whose two goals took his personal contribution to 17 in 19 League appearances.\n\nFor Swansea, this record home defeat, not just in the Premier League but ever, leaves them with having won just two of their last eight League games, their European ambitions in increasing jeopardy.\n\nHad the result ramped up the pressure on Manchester City, who play Arsenal today? José Mourinho thought not. He said: “They have to win, but it’s a responsibility, not a pressure. They have more experience than us, so for them it’s not a problem.”\n\nWas this the best team Mourinho had ever had? He pondered the question before answering: “We can play fantastically well, and this was a perfect game, but if we don’t win the European Cup then in 20 years’ time nobody will remember this team. They have to win competitions for that. It is a young team with years in front of them and together we are going to try to make history.”\n\nThe capacity crowd were still pondering the team changes when Chelsea took the lead, with just 50 seconds played. A pass from Gylfi Sigurdsson failed to find its target, instead bouncing off Tom Carroll and enabling Oscar, the man of the match, to fasten on to the loose ball and run through the middle before scoring from the edge of the D.\n\nFlattering but to deceive, the Swans threatened to equalise after two minutes, when Sigurdsson sought to atone with a 25-yarder which hit the top of Peter Cech’s right-hand post. Cech retained his place, despite the fact that Thibaut Courtois was fit again and on the bench.\n\nSwansea gave a first start to Nelson Oliveira, signed on loan from Benfica to compensate for Wilfried Bony’s departure. Anonymous before he was substituted, it was not an occasion he will want to remember.\n\nThe League leaders were, by a street, the better, more cohesive unit and they deservedly doubled the lead in the 20th minute, when Cesc Fàbregas and Willian created the opportunity for Costa to score with a dead-eyed finish from near the penalty spot.\n\nThe Swans were outmanoeuvred and overrun in midfield, where they were emasculated by the unavailability of Jonjo Shelvey, Leon Britton and Ki Sung-yueng. Mourinho sympathised, saying: “It was difficult for them without those three. That would be the same as us playing without Fàbregas, Matic and Mikel. Midfield is an area of the pitch that is important to them because they are a team that wants to play good football.”\n\nBefore the half-hour mark Willian struck Lukasz Fabianski’s left post with a thumping shot, but Chelsea’s third was only briefly delayed. Then a dreadful back pass from Frederico Fernández out on the right, gifted possession to Costa, who finished with aplomb, left to right. Swansea were spreadeagled on the deck and two minutes later it was 4-0, when Oscar’s inviting centre saw Oscar score his second from 18 yards.\n\nBefore half-time Willian rattled the woodwork for a second time after Costa had rounded Fabianski to set him up and the interval found the Swansea manager, Garry Monk, and his team very much in damage limitation mode.\n\nFortunately for them, Chelsea eased up in the second half, their focus already on Tuesday’s Capital One Cup semi-final against Liverpool, and they contented themselves with just one more goal, side-footed in at close range by the substitute André Schürrle.\n\nGiven his history at Anfield, which includes Luis García’s “ghost” goal in the Champions League semi-finals, how important was the tie at Anfield? “Our next game is our most important, always,” Mourinho said, with a knowing smile.\n\nMonk described Swansea’s anaemic contribution as “horrible”, adding: “The players are hurting and I’m hurting. I can only apologise to the fans as the team’s performance is my responsibility.”\n\nHe sought consolation in the belief that they had played badly on only three occasions all season. “Three out of 22 isn’t bad,” he said. “The bigger picture is that we’ve been good this season and I’m positive that this result isn’t going to have a negative effect on what we’re trying to do.”\n\nThe two managers were in conversation as they disappeared down the tunnel at the final whistle. What had Monk said? “I told José I was sorry I couldn’t give him a game today.”"}, {"date": "17/01/2015", "arena": "White Hart Lane", "attendance": 35973, "home_team": {"name": "Tottenham Hotspur", "lineup": [{"name": "Hugo Lloris", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Walker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eric Dier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jan Vertonghen", "yellows": [30], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [3], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Rose", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Benjamin Stambouli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mousa Dembélé", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [75]}, {"name": "Christian Eriksen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [88], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Kane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nacer Chadli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [88]}, {"name": "Roberto Soldado", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [61]}], "subs": [{"name": "Paulinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [88], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Emmanuel Adebayor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [61], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michel Vorm", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Naughton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andros Townsend", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [75], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Etienne Capoue", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Davies", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Sunderland", "lineup": [{"name": "Costel Pantilimon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Santiago Vergini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John O'Shea", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wes Brown", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Billy Jones", "yellows": [87], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Sebastian Larsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [31], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Rodwell", "yellows": [58], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Patrick van Aanholt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Johnson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Fletcher", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [65]}, {"name": "Jermain Defoe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [75]}], "subs": [{"name": "Connor Wickham", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [65], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordi Gomez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Graham", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [75], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sebastián Coates", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Emanuele Giaccherini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Vito Mannone", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Will Buckley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Jermain Defoe was reminded of what a treasured part of Tottenham Hotspur’s past he is, and how precarious his new club’s Premier League future looks. The 32-year-old’s return to the ground where he spent the best part of a decade ended with a galling defeat for Sunderland, who teeter a point above the relegation zone after falling to a late winner from Christian Eriksen.\n\nDefoe was acclaimed by both sets of fans before kick-off and his manager watched with renewed optimism. Believing he had finally been given the high-calibre striker he craved, Gus Poyet had heralded this match as the dawn of a new era for his team. He switched formation in an effort to play to Defoe’s strengths, deploying a 3-5-2 system with Steven Fletcher partnering the new striker. But even the finest plans are vulnerable to rudimentary mistakes and things took an ominous turn when Sunderland conceded after three minutes.\n\nSantiago Vergini, one of the visitors’ three centre backs, struck an attempted clearance straight to Jan Vertonghen on the edge of the area. The Belgian’s shot looked harmless until it deflected off John O’Shea and into the net.\n\nSunderland tried to reply immediately and appealed for a penalty when Defoe went down under a challenge from Vertonghen. The referee, Chris Foy, was unmoved. Much of the visitors’ play was haphazard in the first period and they struggled to create chances for Defoe – and when they did send the ball towards him he tended to be offside. Fletcher, however, was presented with a wonderful opportunity to score for the visitors but wafted badly wide from close range after a fine cross by Billy Jones.\n\nSpurs, without sparkling, created chances to increase their lead. Eriksen shot weakly at Costel Pantilimon after a cross by Danny Rose and then, in the 24th minute, the goalkeeper raced off his line to deny Roberto Soldado after Vergini’s dawdling kept the striker onside.\n\nTwo minutes later Pantilimon was in action again, hurling himself across his goal to turn away an excellent 25-yard drive from Eriksen, the brains behind most of Tottenham’s good play. Fortune then turned in Sunderland’s favour and perhaps it bodes well that Defoe was involved. Having benefited from a questionable offside decision, the striker was awarded a contested free-kick after a challenge by Vertonghen. There was no debate about Sebastian Larsson’s execution, however, as the Swede curled a superb shot over the wall and into the net from 23 yards. Harry Kane, the most promising of Tottenham’s post-Defoe strikers, was peripheral to proceedings until just before half-time, when his long-range shot rebounded off the base of the post. Pantilimon saved Rose’s follow-up.\n\nPantilimon thwarted Kane early in the second half as Spurs dominated but lacked sharpness. Mauricio Pochettino resorted to replacing Soldado with Emmanuel Adebayor, whose standing with Spurs fans is such that some of them booed as he was given a first appearance since November.\n\nDefoe had a proud record of scoring on his debuts for all five of his previous clubs but his attempt to extend that ended in the 74th minute when he was replaced by Danny Graham. Poyet said he was encouraged by the striker’s display.\n\n“He started bright, he was sharp, if he gets the penalty and scores we would be talking about a great debut but the referee did not see what everyone else saw clearly,” said Poyet. “[Defoe] is going to get better and better and I’m sure when he gets that chance he’s going to put the ball in the back of the net.”\n\nGraham got chances that Defoe might have relished. In the 81st minute Hugo Lloris parried a long-range shot from Adam Johnson into his path but the goalkeeper saved his follow-up. As Sunderland, suddenly emboldened, sought a late winning goal, they were felled by a swift counterattack.\n\nAndros Townsend rampaged 60 yards down the left before sending a low centre to Eriksen, who put an immaculate shot in off the post from 18 yards. Lloris preserved that lead by making a brilliant reflex save from Graham in stoppage time. Vertonghen had a third goal wrongly ruled out for offside as Spurs finished strongly yet again.\n\nTottenham have now won 10 points this season with goals scored in the 88th minute or later, four more than any other team in the Premier League. “Our fitness is very good,” said Pochettino. “The sports science and medical staff is doing a great job so far.

It seems entirely typical of their recent luck that the latest weather forecast for the United Arab Emirates suggests they will wake up to heavy rain, thick cloud and highs of only 20C on Monday.\n\nAs John Carver is discovering, the best laid plans have developed a nasty habit of unravelling fast for those wearing black and white. Since Alan Pardew’s defection to Crystal Palace prompted Carver’s accession as caretaker, Newcastle have played quite well in patches without actually sealing a win.\n\nThis was their third defeat in the four games since Pardew departed. As Carver boards the plane for a mini-break so brief that it ends on Thursday morning, he will surely be fearing his hopes of securing the job until the end of the season are ebbing inexorably away.\n\nAn understrength Southampton gained a victory which kept them third – and Ronald Koeman’s Champions League dream very much alive – by acclimatising to the north-east chill with a Friday work out at Sunderland’s training ground.\n\nThe bracing North Sea air clearly suited the excellent Eljero Elia who scored both the visitors’ goals on an evening which, wholly characteristically, concluded with Newcastle having a decent-looking penalty appeal for handball discounted in stoppage time.\n\n“This win is better than the one against Manchester United because we have some injuries,” said Koeman. “If, in August, people had said we’d be third in the league now I’d have laughed but I’m very, very happy and very delighted.”\n\nDubbed “the new Mario Balotelli” following some slightly outlandish behaviour in Germany, Elia is a new face in the Southampton ranks but the Dutch winger, recently arrived on loan from Werder Bremen, has not taken long to find his feet. Sure enough he spoilt Newcastle’s bright start by controlling James Ward-Prowse’s pass before unleashing a right-foot shot far too crisp for even Tim Krul to hold.\n\nAs the ball squirmed beneath the Holland keeper, the supposed “wild child” swivelled on his heels and raced to the away technical area where Koeman waited, arms outstretched. “Elia’s fast and strong and he’s showing a lot of discipline,” said Koeman. “He’s happy to be at Southampton.”\n\nBut until Elia’s first goal as a Saint, and just before that Graziano Pellé chesting a long ball down impressively to liberate Ward-Prowse, Newcastle had looked quicker and slicker.\n\nThen self-doubt began intruding and Carver’s team wobbled. They were lucky not to fall further behind when José Fonte out-leaped Fabricio Coloccini and connected with Ward-Prowse’s free-kick. Fortunately for Coloccini, Fonte headed over the bar.\n\nFlorin Gardos lifted the Geordie mood, if only temporarily. The Southampton defender looked mortified as his attempted clearance bounced, bizarrely, off Yoan Gouffran before looping into a net otherwise well protected by Newcastle’s blameless academy graduate Fraser Forster.\n\nRegaining a foothold was one thing but maintaining it proved quite another. With Elia continuing to give the Gallowgate End cause for concern and Moussa Sissoko’s counterattacking advances foundering in the face of Fonte, Carver had problems to ponder.\n\nThe quest for solutions became increasingly urgent when Shane Long, fresh off the bench, outjumped Coloccini – worryingly vulnerable these days – to another long ball and nodded down to Elia. After holding off a couple of markers he shot beyond Krul, the ball taking a slight deflection off Daryl Janmaat.\n\nWith Southampton spending the rest of the evening defending, the boos which greeted the final whistle were directed primarily at the referee. Deep in stoppage time, Fonte’s outstretched hand diverted Emmanuel Rivière’s shot. As realisation dawned that Robert Madley had detected no handball, Carver’s face turned as grim as those clouds apparently scudding towards the Gulf.\n\n“It was a penalty, no doubt about it,” he said. “Jobs are decided on decisions like that. I don’t think we deserved to win but we deserved something.”\n\nThe caretaker is clearly fed up with the enduring managerial impasse. “There absolutely needs to be an end to the uncertainty,” he said. “Everyone needs it. I do, my staff do, the players do, the fans do, you guys do.”"}, {"date": "11/01/2015", "arena": "Emirates Stadium", "attendance": 59956, "home_team": {"name": "Arsenal", "lineup": [{"name": "David Ospina", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mathieu Debuchy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [13]}, {"name": "Per Mertesacker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Laurent Koscielny", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [6], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nacho Monreal", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tomas Rosicky", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Francis Coquelin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [68]}, {"name": "Santi Cazorla", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alexis Sánchez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [33, 49], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Olivier Giroud", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [73]}], "subs": [{"name": "Wojciech Szczesny", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mesut Özil", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [73], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Theo Walcott", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [68], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Ramsey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mathieu Flamini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joel Campbell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Hector Bellerin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [13], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Stoke City", "lineup": [{"name": "Asmir Begovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Geoff Cameron", "yellows": [61], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Shawcross", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Philipp Wollscheid", "yellows": [51], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Erik Pieters", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Steven N'Zonzi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Glenn Whelan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jon Walters", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bojan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [73]}, {"name": "Marko Arnautovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Peter Crouch", "yellows": [63], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Marc Muniesa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stephen Ireland", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [73], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marc Wilson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Moses", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charlie Adam", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steve Sidwell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Butland", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "When Alexis Sánchez blasted goalwards and the Stoke City defensive wall crumbled, this one-sided Arsenal victory was summed up in a heartbeat. Sánchez watched his free-kick deflect and the goalkeeper, Asmir Begovic, fumble it into the net, off a post, to give the Chile forward his second goal of the afternoon.\n\nIt was the latest illustration of Sánchez’s ability to make the difference – he was the star turn yet again and the well of superlatives has long since run dry – but it also showed how weak Stoke’s resistance was. They brought a physical approach to the first half, in particular, but they were unable to stymie Arsenal, who enjoyed a measure of revenge for the 3-2 defeat at the Britannia Stadium last month.\n\nSánchez has 18 goals in his debut season in English football and there was able support for him from the excellent Santi Cazorla. There was also the tonic for Arsène Wenger of seeing the return of Mesut Özil as a 73rd-minute substitute while Aaron Ramsey and Mathieu Flamini were back on the bench after less serious injuries. At last the club’s treatment room seems to be clearing, although Mathieu Debuchy was readmitted after he dislocated a shoulder in hitting advertising hoardings.\n\nA prominent talking point was Wenger’s decision to drop Wojciech Szczesny after the goalkeeper’s nightmare performance in the previous league game, the 2-0 defeat at Southampton. Szczesny was fined for smoking in the dressing-room afterwards but Wenger said that the indiscretion had played no part in the selection process.\n\nSzczesny was furious, particularly as it is understood that he had arrived for the game expecting to start, and Wenger was weirdly evasive when he was asked to explain the decision, which brought a Premier League debut for David Ospina. “Look, I don’t want to talk too much about that because the more I talk, the less I inform you,” Wenger said. On how Szczesny had taken the news, Wenger said: “How can you take a decision? You know how you can take a decision.” Szczesny stewed beneath a hooded top on the bench.\n\nStoke failed to extend Ospina. In fact, they failed to do very much at all and the manager Mark Hughes’s only complaints concerned the sluggishness of his players and how they had allowed Arsenal to be so comfortable. The final insult for the travelling fans came in the form of rail problems back up north. Hughes and his squad had arrived by train; they headed home by bus.\n\nNewcastle’s Moussa Sissoko courts Arsenal with ‘club of my heart’ talk Read more\n\nArsenal were slick and pacey from the first whistle and they led when Stoke failed to clear a Sánchez corner. He crossed again for Laurent Koscielny, whose run had gone untracked, and the defender headed past Begovic.\n\nArsenal might have had more in a spiky first half, which finished with the officials being booed off. The home crowd raged whenever Stoke’s players threw themselves into challenges, with Ryan Shawcross’s every touch being jeered. Forgiveness for that challenge on Ramsey in 2010 will never be granted here.\n\nShawcross clashed with Olivier Giroud and he cleaned out Sánchez with a hard but fair tackle. Peter Crouch caught Nacho Monreal with a stray arm and he kicked Per Mertesacker but it was the 11th-minute flashpoint involving Marko Arnautovic that had the repercussions.\n\nArnautovic pushed Debuchy as the Arsenal defender sought to shepherd a ball over the line and Debuchy banged into the hoardings. The Frenchman was carried off following lengthy treatment. Wenger said a timescale for his absence would have to be determined by a specialist. Hughes insisted there had been no malice from Arnautovic.\n\nSánchez and Tomas Rosicky had drawn smart saves out of Begovic before Koscielny’s goal and Giroud was thwarted by the goalkeeper on 21 minutes, moments after Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain had shot narrowly wide. Sánchez then scored his first goal after Steven Nzonzi had been guilty of a heavy touch. Sánchez nipped in to rob him, evading Nzonzi’s subsequent lunge and swapping passes with Rosicky. The finish was low inside Begovic’s near post.\n\nGlenn Whelan had blown Stoke’s big chance on 27 minutes after Bojan Krkic cut back a free-kick and Hughes was spoilt for choice when assessing whom to withdraw at half-time. He took off Erik Pieters and Nzonzi but it could have been anyone.\n\nSánchez killed the game when he scored with his free-kick through the wall and Arsenal were close to more through Cazorla, the substitute Theo Walcott and Özil. Stoke have lost on all seven of their visits to the Emirates Stadium.

They were eliminated from the Capital One Cup on Wednesday, unsurprisingly given Neil Warnock’s use of a second-choice team, but here, with the first-team restored to action, they deservedly secured their first home league win of the season.\n\nTheir joy was encapsulated in the front three: Yannick Bolasie, Fraizer Campbell and Jason Puncheon mesmerised the Leicester City back four, Bolasie with his speed down the wing and Campbell and Puncheon with their power and direct play. Bolasie, in particular, was a revelation, with his best display of the season. Leicester, six days after their demolition of Manchester United, have some thinking to do.\n\nWarnock wanted to single out Puncheon for praise. He deserved it as well. His delivery from set pieces led to both goals and his manager said: “Puncheon is more of a marked man these days. He’s less in the limelight than Yannick, but given his contribution he is a manager’s dream. He is phenomenal.”\n\nWarnock was beaming after this result, maybe more so because he did not like the defensive, edgy way they started. He said: “We were a bit deep and only came into the game after 20 minutes, a bit like against Everton. Leicester have had a good start to the season.” Maybe he had been spooked by their 5-3 win against United.\n\nIt was after the 20-minute mark that Palace, who had survived one Jamie Vardy effort by that stage, began to dominate. Three minutes of pressure should have yielded a goal.\n\nBolasie reached the byline but Puncheon opted to set up Campbell, whose shot was cleared. From the ensuing corner Joe Ledley saw his header cleared off the line by Esteban Cambiasso – who had one of his less effective games since signing this summer – and a minute later Puncheon did go for goal, but his dipping left-foot shot was well saved by Kasper Schmeichel.\n\nThe threat from Bolasie in the first half had been clear enough but the Leicester manager, Nigel Pearson, did not address it and, inevitably, given how close they had come to scoring before the break, Palace took the lead. Six minutes after the interval, Bolasie turned on to his right foot and a cross became a shot that Schmeichel tipped over the crossbar. From Puncheon’s corner, Scott Dann headed down and Campbell applied the finishing flick from three yards out.\n\nPalace’s tails were up and within two minutes they doubled their lead. Bolasie was fouled and from Puncheon’s free-kick Mile Jedinak glanced his header past Schmeichel.\n\nPearson, having watched the game from the stands, as he is intent on doing every week, spelled out why his team had lost. “We had chances and didn’t take them,” he said. “Palace are good at set pieces and we gave away too many. But you have to give Palace a lot of credit. They defended deeply and defended in numbers.

Or is it more a case of Sunderland’s deficiencies being under-estimated?\n\nForget the deceptively narrow scoreline, Brendan Rodgers’s side could easily have won by three or four goals on a day when they were comfortably in control long before Liam Bridcutt’s 49th-minute dismissal for a second bookable offence.\n\nWith Lazar Markovic excelling in a howling wind, a significantly under-strength Liverpool enhanced their hopes of a top-four push while Gus Poyet contemplated another painful struggle against relegation.\n\nGood as the quietly renascent visitors were at times they still endured a few defensive wobbles, leaving Sunderland supporters increasingly alarmed by their team’s failure to give the returning Simon Mignolet a proper work-out in goal.\n\nThose fans know that theories about the Wearsiders being difficult to break down would have been thoroughly deconstructed had Philippe Coutinho and company taken their chances. Indeed, without the injured Lee Cattermole around to break up play and set the tempo Sunderland looked worryingly fragile.\n\nIt left Poyet suitably downcast. “I’m disappointed because I thought by now I’d have had a better impact on how the team plays,” he said. “It’s taking longer than I thought. Some players are taking a long time to learn the basics of how I play.”\n\nLiverpool should have had a very early penalty but Craig Pawson refused to accept that Wes Brown had blatantly brought Markovic down in the area. Rodgers looked aggrieved but soon he must have felt deeply relieved as a piece of first-class officiating on Pawson’s part enabled Markovic finally to score. When Fabio Borini was fouled in the preamble to the goal, the referee played an excellent advantage, thereby permitting the ball to drop to Markovic. The Serb staggered his way into the area before punishing Costel Pantilimon courtesy of a slightly unorthodox shot directed through the Romanian’s legs.\n\n“Lazar was fantastic,” said Rodgers, evidently relieved his summer signing from Benfica is finally confounding the doubters. “He’s taken time to adapt to a new country but he was very, very good indeed – and not just with the ball.”\n\nWith Steven Gerrard deployed in a more advanced role than usual during the final north-east leg of his farewell tour, Liverpool were omnipotent. Tellingly, Rodgers’s 3-4-3 formation – initially featuring the impressively influential Gerrard on the right of an attacking trident that also included Borini and Coutinho – seemed to be fully fazing a Sunderland ensemble apparently unable to fathom this configuration.\n\nTaking full advantage of the hosts’ extreme politeness in persistently standing off him, Markovic very nearly scored a second with a sumptuous right-foot volley in the wake of a half-cleared corner. All high-calibre technique, it was unleashed, acrobatically, in mid-air and rebounded off a post before Pantilimon tipped it to safety.\n\nNoting that Jordan Henderson – once of this parish and a man described by Rodgers as “a real leader who, without question can become captain of this club” – and Lucas were controlling central midfield, home fans greeted the half-time whistle with resounding boos. “I understand their frustration,” said Poyet. “But I think they should be a little more patient. They have to be realistic … but it’s unfair to ask the fans for anything – and it’s true that we don’t give them much.”\n\nIf locals were relieved to see Liverpool’s current captain replaced by Dejan Lovren in a half-time switch necessitated by Gerrard’s tight hamstring, which provoked Emre Can’s relocation from Rodgers’s back three to midfield, any sense of euphoria proved short-lived.\n\nBridcutt had spent the first period looking a very poor man’s Cattermole in the midfield anchoring role but he saw precious little of the remaining 45 minutes after being sent off for a second bookable offence. Having earlier been shown a yellow card for fouling Gerrard, his subsequent push on Can gave Pawson little choice but to issue a red.\n\nAt that point Sunderland’s cause appeared forlorn but, strangely, they instead upped the tempo, began closing opponents down and proceeded to enjoy their best patch of the afternoon.\n\nAt its zenith Adam Johnson unleashed a fabulous swerving shot that bounced back tantalisingly from the underside of the bar with Mignolet surely beaten and Liverpool thankful somehow to scramble the ball clear.\n\n“The sending-off threw us for 10 minutes,” said Rodgers, whose replacement of Borini with Mario Balotelli subsequently helped his team reassert much of their earlier authority. “The only disappointment is that we didn’t win by more.”"}, {"date":

QPR have specialised in unwanted achievements during the past few years, when their recent experience of the top flight has encompassed indignity and ignominy, and now ineptitude on their travels means the record books need rewriting.\n\n“It is hard to win away,” said their manager, Harry Redknapp. But, far from winning, Rangers have not claimed a point anywhere other than Loftus Road since May. As Burnley’s revival continued, they became the only team to lose their first 10 away games of a Premier League campaign. Along the way, they equalled an 89-year club record for consecutive defeats on the road. If that was a statistical subplot to a relegation six-pointer, the significance of Burnley’s win was reflected in the league table.\n\nThe sight of the standings brought cheers on the concourses. The Clarets had leapfrogged their visitors to escape the relegation zone.\n\nBurnley’s current top scorer ensured his predecessor’s penalty mattered not. It felt inevitable that Charlie Austin, who scored and was sent off when QPR beat Burnley 2-0 in December, would find the net on his return here. He bucked the trend of goalscorers who refuse to celebrate against their old clubs, evidently enjoying his leveller. When Burnley delivered their decider, their supporters taunted their former favourite with a chorus of “You’re not Danny Ings”.\n\nIngs was the matchwinner, his trademark persistence producing its reward. Prolific as Austin was in Lancashire, Burnley have fared better with Ings as the cornerstone of their attack. Austin once served as a roadblock to Ings’ ambitions. The QPR forward scored 28 times in his final season at Turf Moor and Ings just three. Without him, Ings became the Championship player of the year and is proving himself in the higher league.\n\nAustin was much QPR’s best outfield player: he rattled the post two minutes after Burnley took the lead; won the penalty, slaloming past two defenders before being tripped by Dean Marney and drilling his spot kick past Tom Heaton; and threatened a second equaliser.\n\nBurnley were brighter from the off. They led when Scott Arfield wriggled away from Joey Barton and Mauricio Isla, darted past a static Richard Dunne and angled his shot into the far corner of Robert Green’s goal.\n\n“We have some quality,” said their manager, Sean Dyche. “Scotty Arfield’s goal is tremendous. There are two nutmegs and a fine finish. If that is Alexis Sánchez, that gets shown 1,000 times over the weekend. We will be lucky to get 15.”\n\nHis QPR counterpart invoked another South American to star at Barcelona, albeit referring to the unheralded Arfield in less complimentary terms. “We are not talking about Lionel Messi,” he said. “He has gone past three of us far too easy.”\n\nDefensive failings were a common denominator in the two goals. “The second was shocking,” Redknapp said. “Horrendous.” Ashley Barnes lofted a pass forward, Ings capitalised on Steven Caulker’s diffidence, skipped away from Dunne and finished with a scuffed shot.\n\nIt was the first time this season Burnley had scored twice at home. There ought to have been more. The in-form Green saved superbly from David Jones and Michael Keane, while Barnes had a strike chalked off when Green went to ground. “Ten years ago it is a goal,” said a philosophical Dyche. “Now it is not. Barnesy gets his hand on the keeper’s shoulder.”\n\nHe had few complaints; the QPR faithful rather more. Stewards had to intervene to halt a heated exchange between fans and Clint Hill, Barton and Dunne after the final whistle. Redknapp, downplaying the incident, insisted Dunne went over to applaud the travelling support. “He didn’t go to have a row,” he said.\n\nBut perhaps the fans were aggrieved by the familiar sense of the defeat as their only change came in personnel. While Burnley, unaltered for the seventh consecutive game, stuck to the same formula, QPR’s selection betrayed a hint of desperation. Redknapp recalled an outcast who had played 24 minutes of Premier League football this season. Branded three stone overweight by his manager in October, Adel Taarabt looked neither particularly fat, nor, unlike the hosts, did he seem especially fit.

There is daylight between Chelsea and their closest rivals once more and, though José Mourinho was dissatisfied with some aspects of his side’s performance, the bottom line is that they are two points clear of City and the title is still theirs to lose.\n\nIf City were hoping that Chelsea’s debacle against Tottenham Hotspur on New Year’s Day would spark a crisis in west London, they were sorely mistaken.\n\nNewcastle were certainly troublesome opponents in the first half and John Carver, their caretaker manager, did not shy away from acclaiming his chances of being appointed on a permanent basis, but the result was never in doubt once Oscar calmed Chelsea’s nerves shortly before half-time. The best sides win when they are not playing well, whereas Newcastle played well but lost for the sixth time in their past eight matches.\n\nMourinho was not happy with Chelsea’s lethargy before Oscar’s goal, although he left it up to his assistant, Steve Holland, to reveal that some constructive criticism was dealt out during the interval. The Football Association’s decision to charge Mourinho with misconduct following his comments about a campaign against Chelsea means that we might not hear from him much in the next few weeks. “José was very clear with what he wanted them to improve, and the players did that,” Holland said. “He wanted the team to play further up the pitch and be more aggressive and assertive.”\n\nMourinho’s assessment was as accurate as ever. Chelsea’s aura of invincibility has received a few too many dents for his liking in recent weeks and it was strange to see them outplayed by Newcastle during a first half when the men in blue shirts seemed allergic to keeping the ball.\n\nChelsea were fortunate that Newcastle were not more ruthless and that Petr Cech, who was making a rare start in goal because of Thibaut Courtois’s thumb injury, showed no signs of any rust. The expectation was that Newcastle would be on the end of a fearsome backlash from Chelsea, but Cech was forced to remind us of his outstanding qualities more often than Mourinho would have anticipated.\n\nNewcastle were inspired by the memory of their victory against Chelsea at St James’ Park last month and they did not sit back. Instead, driven on by the surges from midfield of Moussa Sissoko and the impish dribbling of Rémy Cabella, they were adventurous and dominant for long spells, despite being deprived of several key players because of injuries and the Africa Cup of Nations.\n\nYoan Gouffran’s firm free-kick was beaten away by Cech, Sissoko crashed a shot against the outside of the post after skipping past John Terry with surprising ease and the Chelsea captain also hung out a leg to deflect Cabella’s curling shot just past the left post.\n\nCabella’s quick feet, daring and ability to ghost past defenders made him Newcastle’s biggest threat and he had their clearest chance. Eden Hazard lost possession and the ball broke to Cabella, who drifted past Terry and then curled a shot towards the bottom-right corner from the edge of the area.\n\nCech was a sizeable obstacle, but he was not being afforded much protection from his defence. Gary Cahill paid the price for his part in that 5-3 defeat at Tottenham and was replaced by Kurt Zouma, but Chelsea were still unusually open, and their problems increased when César Azpilicueta limped off with a groin injury.\n\nCarver was reflecting on the effectiveness of his gameplan at that point and he must have been encouraged to see Mourinho lose his temper with Diego Costa for his lack of movement as a pass from Cesc Fàbregas sailed out of play.\n\nThere were flashes from Chelsea, however, such as a volley from Oscar that looped wide, and Newcastle’s failure to take their chances made them vulnerable.\n\nThe disappointment for Newcastle was that Oscar’s goal was so avoidable. They were not alive to the danger when Chelsea won a corner on the right and Willian quickly tapped it to Branislav Ivanovic, who laid the ball on a plate for Oscar at the far post.\n\nChelsea were liberated after the goal, playing with greater freedom and authority, and Costa doubled their lead when he finished off a stunning move in the 59th minute.

frustrate Manchester City’s attempts to keep pace with Chelsea at the top of the table, coming back from a goal behind to claim a draw that must have felt almost as welcome as a victory. At least Roberto Martínez’s much maligned defence can start to feel good about itself again, for despite a wealth of possession City were unable to break the Everton backline down.\n\nWith Sergio Agüero only coming on for the last 20 minutes, and then looking predictably rusty, City were not at their sharpest yet the home side still deserved credit for sticking to their task and finishing the stronger.\n\n“Once they scored we upped the tempo and looked really strong at the end,” Martínez said. “It was a great reaction and a really positive performance. We allowed City too much space in the first half, even though we defended our area well. When they scored I thought it must have been offside because I couldn’t see two players behind Joel Robles, but having seen replays I must congratulate the linesman in getting his decision spot on.”\n\nManuel Pellegrini thought the game should have been put to bed long before then, and he had a point. Everton spent most of the first period in their own half of the field, defending on the edge of their area as City waited patiently for David Silva to find a way through. It seemed only a matter of time before the close control and deft passing of the Spain forward set up a colleague with a scoring opportunity, yet in the absence of Agüero and Edin Dzeko City seemed to lack anyone with the nous to find the space Silva was looking to exploit.\n\nStevan Jovetic shot too high from a Silva invitation after nine minutes, then Jesús Navas missed an even more presentable opportunity after a Phil Jagielka mistake had given Silva time in which to operate, but in 45 minutes of trying City never actually forced Robles to make a save. Everton’s reserve goalkeeper betrayed nerves when he got away with a poor clearance just four minutes into the game, yet half-time arrived without City putting him properly to the test.\n\nThe visitors would have felt even more sheepish had they turned around a goal behind, which they almost did when Everton finally managed an attack worthy of the name on the stroke of the interval. Muhamed Besic, who was beginning to annoy the home crowd by constantly passing sideways and occasionally into touch, played a ball forward for once and allowed Seamus Coleman to put Romelu Lukaku clear on goal. Joe Hart came out smartly to spread himself and save the shot, and when the ball came back to Coleman, still in his original position, the full-back struck the bar from 25 yards.\n\nWhile Everton would hardly have deserved an interval lead, it was a reminder of how wasteful City were being with almost limitless possession.\n\nThe second half began in exactly the same way, with Silva attempting a one-two with Samir Nasri in the area only for the latter to miscontrol the return. Then Ross Barkley sent Lukaku away down the left and Hart had to make another save.\n\nAs the hour approached City were dominating the game but Everton were two up in terms of attempts on target. After exactly an hour City did manage to force Robles into action, though it was only a routine punch to clear a Nasri shot from a free-kick. Pellegrini sent Agüero on shortly after that, the striker returning just in time to see Jagielka find the net from a Leighton Baines free-kick, an effort disallowed because Steven Naismith was offside.\n\nAfter waiting over 70 minutes for a goal Goodison was treated to one at either end in quick succession. A magnificent tackle by Pablo Zabaleta on Lukaku freed Fernandinho to set up the first, the Brazilian turning up on the line to head home after Robles had managed to block when Silva looked certain to score. The paucity of chances previously led to the suspicion that one goal might settle the contest, but Everton were having none of that. Baines flighted in a diagonal cross from a free-kick, one that Hart thought he could reach but realised too late he could not, and Naismith read the situation perfectly in getting to the ball first to glance a header past the goalkeeper.\n\nHart will judge himself harshly – he came for the ball and did not get it – and the two dropped points could be important at the end of the season. Yet oddly, in the overall context of the game, Hart was the busier of the two goalkeepers, and but for his two saves from Lukaku City might have lost all the points. “We came up with the best chances of the game,” Martínez said, truthfully. While City should function better with Agüero restored to fitness, this game was perfect demonstration of why they are being linked with Wilfried Bony."}, {"date": "10/01/2015", "arena": "The King

embroiled in a fracas sparked by Matty James’s dangerous tackle on Jores Okore and Ciaran Clark’s strong-arm response. But if there was any benefit for Aston Villa in the spotlight falling on James and Clark as they were separated by coaching staff and stewards running down the tunnel after their red cards, it was that their 3,000 travelling fans suspended their impassioned calls for Paul Lambert to receive his own dismissal.\n\nAs Leicester City pulled to within two points of 17th place thanks to Paul Konchesky’s fine goal in time added on at the end of the first half, momentum and stability suggest they have a greater chance of retaining their Premier League status than Villa, even though the West Midlands side are still two points above the dreaded dotted line.\n\nWith four red cards and just one goal from their past six league games, Villa appear in something of a freefall that Randy Lerner, their chairman in absentia, shows no sign of addressing. Tom Fox, the chief executive, will show his mettle this month as he either gives Lambert the requisite backing in the transfer market or takes the decisive action Villa fans have started beseeching and changes manager.\n\nAfter two and a half years at the helm, Lambert seems no nearer improving Villa’s status, which has dwindled over the five years since they finished sixth for the third successive season. How culpable he can be judged to be is a moot point as the club have scaled down their squad in this period but, while the players are playing for him, and Clark and others showed their passion, the overall direction is downwards. When that follows two seasons of finishing 15th, that is dangerous. Villa are in a no-man’s land that by next season could look a lot like the Championship.\n\nLeicester made it four games unbeaten, their best run this season, and no one could argue that they did not deserve their win, only their second at home this season. Leicester’s faith in Nigel Pearson, who went 13 games and three months without a win after that memorable 5-3 triumph over Manchester United in September, is looking vindicated as his team continue to play without fear and with every chance of making a good fist of staying up.\n\nLeicester made it seven points from three league games, in addition to last week’s FA Cup victory over Newcastle United, as they finished the first half strongly.\n\nVilla, with Ashley Westwood playing excellently alongside the powerful Carlos Sánchez in the centre of midfield, had been the better team early on without threatening in the final third.\n\nWhen David Nugent smashed a superb shot against the underside of the crossbar three minutes before half-time and Leonardo Ulloa headed over, Villa’s resistance looked in danger of breaking. Sure enough, Leicester made the all-important breakthrough when Konchesky scored with a cracking shot. Danny Simpson’s throw from the right-hand side was nodded on by Nugent for Ulloa to chest and volley on and over himself into the area where, with Alan Hutton only managing half a clearance, Konchesky arrived to swivel and hammer in a fine strike off Brad Guzan’s right-hand post.\n\nThis must have felt like justice for Konchesky, who had been sent off in the 2-1 defeat at Villa Park five weeks ago when he nuzzled foreheads with Hutton, shortly after the Villa full-back had scored the winning goal.\n\nLeicester are at home again next week, to Stoke City, when Pearson hopes to have Andrej Kramaric available after the £9.5 million Croatia striker’s work permit hearing. “He’s a young man we’ve followed for a long time,” Pearson said. “He’s not just a rabbit out of a hat. But if we can get the work permit, then he’ll just add to what we’ve got. It’s not a case of replacing what we have, it’s supplementing what we have.”\n\nNugent could have scored when he stretched on to Marc Albrighton’s cross on the break in the first half, when Anthony Knockaert was begging for the striker to leave the chance to him, and Leicester also enjoyed the better of the chances in a second half in which they sat back and invited Villa on to them.\n\nThe visitors only managed one shot on target, Benteke’s weak shot saved early in the second half, and Pearson was justified in claiming his team were deserved winners. “We easily created the better chances in both halves,” the Leicester manager said. “It’s a welcome three points but points we deserved.”"}, {"date": "10/01/2015", "arena": "The Liberty Stadium", "attendance": 20745, "home_team":

No, not his own (for the time being) Wilfried Bony but Andy Carroll, who has scored four goals this season – three of them against Swansea.\n\nCarroll, whose England days may not be gone for ever on this evidence, struck twice when West Ham won 3-1 in the corresponding fixture at Upton Park five weeks ago and embarrassed the Welsh club’s defence again for what looked like a high-class matchwinner until Mark Noble’s inadvertent late equaliser past his own goalkeeper.\n\nWhile Carroll is back to something like the form that won him international recognition – “he has supremacy over everyone” Monk says – Swansea’s own human wrecking ball, Bony, is away on Africa Cup of Nations duty and his replacement, Bafétimbi Gomis, has one goal to show for 18 Premier League appearances and is still a work in progress.\n\nThat said, it was the Frenchman’s header from which Noble nudged the ball into his own net. Monk insisted Gomis deserved to be credited with the goal – “he covered every blade of grass, I think” – and applauded his gesture in grabbing a French tricolour from the touchline and waving it to the heavens in solidarity with those who lost their lives in Paris. “Trust me, Bafe is a top striker”, Monk said.\n\nBony was not the only notable absentee. The Swans were also without Ki Sung-yueng, Jonjo Shelvey and Jefferson Montero, for various reasons, while West Ham had their leading scorer, Diafra Sakho, injured and Cheikhou Kouyaté on international duty with Senegal.\n\nIt was West Ham who coped best with their losses. Deployed in wing-back formation, they effectively stymied Swansea’s close passing style. Two good teams cancelled one another out until the 43rd minute, when Carroll accepted Stewart Downing’s left-wing cross and jockeyed room for himself on the 18-yard line to shoot across Lukasz Fabianski and into the keeper’s left corner. The goal was a delightful piece of technique but dire from a defensive viewpoint. Carroll, who has now scored seven times against the Swans, held off Ashley Williams to win the ball with his chest, brushed aside a half-hearted challenge by his namesake, Tom Carroll, then turned Federico Fernández before getting his shot away.\n\nIn extremis, Monk took off both his wingers. Playing at a higher tempo, Swansea did improve for a time, but James Collins should have doubled the margin when he headed wide of the far post before the equaliser.\n\nIn the 74th minute Sigurdsson’s corner from the left was met at the near post by Gomis, whose twisting header hit the far upright and bounced down against Noble, whose involuntary contact deflected the ball in.\n\nWest Ham put in a strong finish, Carl Jenkinson demanding a notable save from Fabianski from distance, Neil Taylor clearing off the line from James Tomkins and Carroll miscuing at close range at the death.\n\nSam Allardyce, who has a chest infection, was not at the match but was in touch throughout with his assistant, Neil McDonald, who thought the Hammers deserved to win. “We created some really good chances and Andy scored a fantastic goal,” he said. “We kept Swansea at arm’s length, shooting from distance. We stifled their space and used the energy of our wing-backs to get forward. I thought the tactics worked really well. Over the two games we’ve taken four points off a good team.”\n\nMonk had a different view. He said: “It was a hard game physically – West Ham always make it that. They scored against the run of play. It was a fantastic goal, a great strike, but we gave Carroll too much space. We knew he wanted to shoot with his left foot and should have shown him on to his right and closed that gap. I made the substitutions to give us more of a cutting edge and we managed to get a well-deserved goal.”"}, {"date": "10/01/2015", "arena": "The Hawthorns", "attendance": 24818, "home_team": {"name": "West Bromwich Albion", "lineup": [{"name": "Ben Foster", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andre Wisdom", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gareth McAuley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joleon Lescott", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Baird", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Brunt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Claudio Yacob", "yellows": [35], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Morrison", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stéphane Sessegnon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [76]}, {"name": "Saido Berahino", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [78], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Brown Ideye", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [73]}], "subs": [{"name": "Craig Gardner", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [76], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Anichebe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [73], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Boaz Myhill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sébastien Pocognoli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Graham Dorrans", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Craig Dawson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Georgios Samaras", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Hull City", "lineup": [{"name": "Allan McGregor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Chester", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex Bruce", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Curtis Davies", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Maynor Figueroa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ahmed Elmohamady", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Meyler", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jake Livermore", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stephen Quinn", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [78]}, {"name": "Abel Hernandez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [39]}, {"name": "Nikica Jelavic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [33]}], "subs": [{"name": "Tom Huddlestone", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [78], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robbie Brady", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [33], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Maguire", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paul McShane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Dawson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steve Harper", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Ince", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [39], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "It is little wonder that Tony Pulis is so determined to hold on to Saido Berahino. On an afternoon when the West Bromwich Albion head coach’s patience was stretched to breaking point at times – in particular when Brown Ideye made a pig’s ear of a gilt-edged chance in the first half – it was no surprise that it was left to Berahino, 12 minutes from time, to deliver the goal that kickstarted the Welshman’s latest managerial challenge.\n\nThe best player on the pitch by a distance, Berahino made it five goals in two games under Pulis when he drilled in from 10 yards out, after Allan McGregor was penalised for picking up Ahmed Elmohamady’s needless backpass.\n\nAfter looking as miserable as sin in the wake of each of his four goals against Gateshead in the FA Cup last Saturday, Berahino celebrated his latest strike – teed up by the substitute Victor Anichebe, and thrashed low through a clutch of Hull players – with relish.\n\nPulis, a picture of frustration for so long, turned on his heels and punched the air. A drab game had the goal it so badly needed and Albion, with one sweep of Berahino’s right boot, were climbing from one place above the relegation zone at the start of the day to 14th. While there is little breathing space – Albion are still only two points from safety – this was a victory to savour for a club that had lost seven of their 10 previous league games. It was also a performance that confirmed how important Berahino is to Albion’s hopes, especially in light of another dismal display from Brown, the club-record signing, who shot horribly wide when put clean through by his strike partner in the first half.\n\nBerahino was not so generous when opportunity knocked. The 21-year-old has now scored 14 times this season and that total will need to keep ticking over nicely for Albion to be safe.\n\n“There’s lots of work to be done,” Pulis said. “I think the crowd were very patient – we’ll need them to be behind us. The important thing is people have to recognise and realise how tough this will be. People think I’m just saying that to take the pressure off. Well, just have a look at how many teams are in the Championship who have spent years in the Premier League.\n\n“The reason why they’ve gone into the Championship is because people around the place got complacent. Everyone took their foot off the pedal and, as soon as you do that, you’ll get relegated. This club and everybody around it has to understand that this is a real dogfight until the end of the season. For us to stay out of it, everybody has to pull together.”\n\nFor Hull, who are now outside the relegation zone only on goal difference, this was a tough defeat to stomach. As well as cursing the fact that Albion were running out of ideas before that dreadful mix up between McGregor and Elmohamady in the penalty area, Steve Bruce was left to ruefully reflect on the sight of both Nikica Jelavic and Abel Hernández limping off inside the opening 40 minutes, to add their names to an already lengthy injury list. Hernández has a groin strain, while Jelavic, worryingly, is struggling with the knee that was operated on earlier this season.\n\n“With the problems we had with the loss of our strikers, you take a point away from home. And, to be perfectly honest, it looked a 0-0 written all over it,” Bruce, the Hull manager, said. “It’s a frustration to lose the game with the misunderstanding we had – it was cruel on us. He [Elmohamady] doesn’t need to touch it, you could also say the goalkeeper doesn’t need to come out for it. It’s that split second where there is a lack of communication and, unfortunately, we’ve been punished.”"}, {"date": "10/01/2015", "arena": "Selhurst Park", "attendance": 24193, "home_team": {"name": "Crystal Palace", "lineup": [{"name": "Julian Speroni", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joel Ward", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Scott Dann", "yellows": [45], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Damien Delaney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Kelly", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Ledley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jason Puncheon", "yellows": [77], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [80], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James McArthur", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Barry Bannan", "yellows": [37], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Dwight Gayle", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [69], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [87]}, {"name": "Glenn Murray", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [74]}], "subs": [{"name": "Adrian Mariappa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Brede Hangeland", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adlene Guedioura", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fraizer Campbell", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [87], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wilfried Zaha", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [74], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wayne Hennessey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jerome Thomas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Tottenham Hotspur", "lineup": [{"name": "Hugo Lloris", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Walker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Federico Fazio", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jan Vertonghen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Rose", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Benjamin Stambouli", "yellows": [55], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [75]}, {"name": "Mousa Dembélé", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andros Townsend", "yellows": [25], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [69]}, {"name": "Christian Eriksen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nacer Chadli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Kane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [49], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Younes Kaboul", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Lennon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paulinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Roberto Soldado", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [75], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michel Vorm", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Etienne Capoue", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [69], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Davies", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "As Alan Pardew walked off the pitch punching the air and blowing kisses to the Selhurst Park faithful, it became crystal clear why he had left a top-half club for a team fighting against relegation. The relationship between Pardew and Newcastle United supporters had deteriorated to the point that it was hard to envisage them sharing such joy on a regular basis again, and Pardew is a manager who thrives on positive emotion.\n\nPalace, too, needed to stoke fresh passion. This is a club that had fallen into the grip of uncharacteristic sullenness during the first half of the season. Results and performances had not been atrocious under Neil Warnock but they had been dispiriting, lacking the qualities required to instil hope. By the end of this slow burner of a match, Palace were showcasing those qualities again. Suddenly their survival prospects look brighter. This Palace were effervescent, disciplined and sharp. “If I could pay credit to Tony Pulis, in the last 15 minutes the team looked like the team from last year,” said Pardew, who still felt it prudent to give a reminder that fortunes can switch quickly. He knows that better than most.\n\n“Football is highs and lows,” he said. “Spurs probably had one of the performances of the season against Chelsea last time and then they come and get beaten at Crystal Palace, so it changes quickly. It’ll be the same for us if we lose at Burnley next week, so you have to keep your feet on the floor.”\n\nPardew’s impact was not instantaneous. Indeed, he admitted he was disappointed with his team’s start to this match. They pressed with great vigour and even mustered the first shot, albeit a wayward long-range effort from Barry Bannan, but Spurs soon began to look ominously comfortable. Mauricio Pochettino’s team had come into the match on the back of a six-match unbeaten streak that included that exhilarating victory over Chelsea. When Harry Kane forced a save from Julián Speroni with a decent drive in the 17th minute, it seemed like the Palace goalkeeper might be in for a busy afternoon.\n\nPalace were granted a surprising pardon in the 22nd minute when Christian Eriksen slashed wide from seven yards after Spurs had cut the home defence asunder, Kyle Walker serving the Dane with a low cross after racing past Martin Kelly.\n\nPardew’s side responded well and two minutes later James McArthur headed a Dwight Gayle cross over from 16 yards. Then, in the 35th minute, Kelly won the ball deep in Tottenham territory before passing to McArthur, whose canny pass gave Glenn Murray exactly the sort of chance that the striker had been recalled from his loan spell at Reading to take. But Hugo Lloris dashed off his line and saved the striker’s shot with his legs.\n\nMurray’s inclusion was one of two personnel changes that Pardew had made. With Murray stationed ahead of a four-man midfield featuring Gayle on the left, Palace deployed two specialist predators in a bid to solve the scoring problems that have hampered them all season. Joe Ledley was entrusted with Mile Jedinak’s deeper midfield role, while the other noticeable formation change saw the full-backs Kelly and Joel Ward switch sides to enable the latter to revert to the right.\n\nA half-time change by Pardew helped give Palace the edge, as Adlène Guedioura’s intelligence in midfield enabled them to gain a platform higher up the pitch. That, however, did not become apparent until after Spurs had taken the lead. In the 49th minute Kane produced a flash of the form that has enabled him to plunder six goals in six league games, collecting a through-ball from Nacer Chadli before adjusting his feet and firing a precise low shot into the corner of the net from the edge of the Palace box.\n\nPalace’s immediate reply was promising. Twice in the next four minutes Scott Dann headed free-kicks from Jason Puncheon on to Gayle, who was thwarted both times by Lloris. Gayle would not be denied in the 69th minute, however, after Palace were awarded a penalty following an ill-advised challenge by Benjamin Stambouli on Ledley. Gayle rammed the spot-kick into the bottom corner.\n\nBoth managers altered their strikeforces as they pursued three points. Pardew introduced Wilfried Zaha for Murray while Pochettino replaced Stambouli with Roberto Soldado. Pardew’s switch was to prove more effective, as Zaha created the winning goal with a run from the left that combined trickery and determination. Puncheon complemented that build-up by finishing superbly, whacking a low shot into the net from 16 yards.\n\nSpurs appealed for a penalty when Kane tumbled in the box moments later – Pardew admitted the visitors had a good case – and Speroni had to make an awkward save from a swirling shot by Mousa Dembélé. But that is not to say Palace finished by clinging on - for they, too, threatened to score again, Zaha bringing a notable late save from Lloris.\n\nBy the end Palace positively fizzed with a vigour and unpredictability that augurs well and that will worry anyone who had been counting on them taking one of the relegation spots."}, {"date": "01/01/2015", "arena": "Bet365 Stadium", "attendance":

Britannia Stadium. Louis van Gaal made no attempt to sugarcoat United’s poor performance on an afternoon when Stoke City were left to lament some suspect refereeing from Michael Oliver, poor finishing from Mame Diouf and the moment when the woodwork denied Peter Crouch a possible winner.\n\nAfter six successive victories prompted talk of United joining the title race, Van Gaal has now endured the frustration of watching his side draw three of their past four matches. The United manager has railed against the manic festive schedule – the sight of Ashley Young pulling a hamstring in the second half strengthened his argument about the dangers of the fixture pile-up – but the Dutchman had no complaints about the result here. “I think Stoke City deserved the victory more,” Van Gaal said.\n\nStoke played with courage and belief and on another day could easily have reprised last season’s 2-1 home victory over United. Crouch was a constant thorn in the visitors’ side. He set up Ryan Shawcross’s opening goal after Phil Jones was caught ball-watching, had a strong penalty appeal turned down when Chris Smalling clearly handled and headed a free-kick against the upright. Marko Arnautovic also produced one of his best performances in a Stoke shirt.\n\nRadamel Falcao celebrates Manchester United’s equaliser in their 1-1 draw at the Britannia Stadium. Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty Images\n\nUnited looked flat. They had almost twice as much possession as Stoke but did little with it. Radamel Falcao’s first-half equaliser was one of only two United shots on target all game. There was a lack of penetration on the flanks, their buildup play was pedestrian and United looked like a team crying out for an injection of pace. At the other end of the pitch, Chris Smalling, Jonny Evans and Jones never instilled confidence.\n\nThe draw stretches United’s unbeaten run to 10 matches but Van Gaal is much more concerned by another statistic: only two wins from their past 12 league games on the road. “I’m not interested in a period of unbeaten … we have to win away games and we didn’t do that,” the United manager said.\n\n“I think Stoke were closer to the victory, with the ball on the post and the first chance from Diouf they had two major chances and we didn’t create so much in spite of the time and space. We could pass the ball quicker, I don’t think that one cross was good. And also I think the last pass from our midfielders was not good.”\n\nMark Hughes was full of praise for his players and bitterly disappointed with the referee. The Stoke manager claimed Oliver could have pointed to the spot on two occasions – the second when Robin van Persie tangled with Geoff Cameron after Crouch’s header hit a post. He had a stronger case with Smalling’s handball. “Certainly the first one, I think Smalling has lost Peter on the initial header and is just trying to get something in the way of the ball. He’s made an intentional movement with his arm to bat the ball down. The referee is clearly standing there, so why he hasn’t given it I don’t know.”\n\nUnited could not have made a worse start. The game was only 106 seconds old when Arnautovic delivered a corner that Crouch met with a free header.\n\nJones was too preoccupied with Arnautovic’s centre to notice that Shawcross had got away from him and by the time he got his bearings the Stoke captain was volleying home. Then came the Diouf chance, when the former United player used his pace and strength to get past Evans only to profligately shoot wide. “Two-nil to the good we would have been in a situation where I don’t think United would have been able to come back given the way they performed,” Hughes said.\n\nInstead Falcao plundered an equaliser for United seven minutes later, when the Colombian turned in a Wayne Rooney corner that Michael Carrick flicked on at the near post – the 11th time this season that Stoke have conceded from a set piece.

"Alan Pardew will aim to bring a new attacking dimension to Crystal Palace after witnessing them draw another blank on their travels.\n\nThe departing Newcastle United manager is set to take over as Neil Warnock’s successor at Selhurst Park on Thursday night after going into the dressing room at Villa Park to congratulate his prospective charges on their latest hard-earned point, under Keith Millen’s caretaker charge, but to tell them they need to start creating more chances if they are to stay in the Premier League.\n\nPalace remain in the relegation zone, one point adrift of 17th place, after failing to score for the fifth time in six away matches in the league. An FA Cup trip to Dover Athletic on Sunday provides an opportunity for the current players to indicate they can fulfil the new manager’s remit to attack with greater potency while retaining the solidity with which Tony Pulis helped them stay up last season.\n\nMillen said: “He had no input in the game but came down to congratulate the players afterwards. He was pleased but said we need to add more to our game. We need to score more goals to stay in the division.\n\n“ He was pleased and proud. He has seen us play before so knows what we are about. He knows we need a different dimension. We need to add something else to our game.”\n\nMillen has been asked to stay on the coaching staff and is excited at what Pardew can implement. “I think he will bring passion and the fans will respond to that,” he said. “He has a knowledge of the Premier League. You look at his Newcastle team, they have flair. He will want to make us more attractive and exciting while keeping what we’re good at. I’m sure he will have talked to the chairman about transfers; we all know we need to bring in players.”\n\nPardew’s name was on the car park list and everyone’s lips before the game as Palace’s manager in waiting came to evaluate his prospective charges before his impending appointment.\n\nHe took his seat in the stands – alongside Kevin Blackwell, one of Warnock’s coaching staff, and behind Steve Parish, the co-chairman – back at the ground where he enjoyed his most celebrated moment in a Palace shirt almost a quarter of a century ago when scoring an extra-time FA Cup semi-final winner over Liverpool.\n\nNone could doubt Palace’s resilience as they ground out another goalless draw to add to Sunday’s at Queens Park Rangers. With the bottom six all avoiding defeat, it was also a necessary point.\n\nWilfried Zaha gave another anodyne performance that illustrated why Pardew will seek to sign a proven striker.\n\nVilla’s own goalscoring problems have been well documented, mainly because they do not appear in any danger of going away. They have failed to score in 11 of their 20 games, a run that includes four of their last five games, and in 39 of Paul Lambert’s 96 league games at the helm, a 40% failure rate that is the worst in the Premier League in that period. Even with the luxury of recalling Gabriel Agbonlahor to play in a three-man frontline with Andreas Weimann and Christian Benteke, who had scored the winning goal at Selhurst Park when these teams met a month ago, Villa still created scant chances.\n\nThey certainly started very positively, Benteke drawing a sharp save low at his near post from Julián Speroni after a swift passing move from kick-off before Palace had touched the ball.\n\nThen Speroni posted a further reminder of his worth with a brilliant save in the same vicinity as Alan Hutton came dashing in, when a cross pinballed off Joel Ward, and looked certain to score. But Villa’s fortunes suffered a dip when Ron Vlaar, their captain only just returned from a long-standing calf injury, had to limp off with a knee injury after 14 minutes. “He fears it could be the same injury he suffered in the World Cup,” Lambert said.\n\nPardew at least knows Palace have pace on the break, and when Zaha dispossessed Leandro Bacuna in the centre circle, Yannick Bolasie dashed away, past Ciaran Clark, only to lift his shot against the crossbar from the edge of the penalty area as he went face to face with Brad Guzan.\n\nBut when Benteke scythed a shot just over from Carlos Sánchez’s pull-back and Speroni parried Bacuna’s swerving free-kick three minutes from time, the stalemate was assured. Villa are endeavouring to play a more expansive game, with the full-backs pushing high and wide and the excellent Sánchez covering in between, but they move the ball too slowly and allow opponents to block them off. “When you have that much possession, you have got to score when you create the chances,” Lambert said.\n\nMan of the match: Carlos Sánchez (Aston Villa)"}, {"date": "01/01/2015",

whose defensive woes leave them susceptible to being dragged into a Premier League relegation fight. A fourth consecutive defeat – and seventh in nine across all competitions – mean they are now just four points above the bottom three.\n\nHull drew to within two points of Martínez’s side after capitalising on indecision at the back from their opponents. First-half goals from Ahmed Elmohamady and the former Everton forward Nikica Jelavic settled the contest well before the visitors lost Antolín Alcaraz to a second booking late on. With fixtures against Manchester City and Chelsea and a Merseyside derby on the horizon, the pressure will soon go up a notch.\n\n“I welcome that pressure,” retorted Martínez. “What I feel is we are not happy with our return of points. I know the quality that we have, the injuries we have and the second goal came from a new partnership between the keeper and defenders. “I will take responsibility. The players showed an incredible appetite, an incredible character to compete but the reality is that we are low in confidence. It is a tough period but the reality is that the second half of the season is an opportunity to get back our swagger and our enjoyment in our play.”\n\nHull rediscovered their own joie de vivre following 12 months of relegation form. Despite reaching the FA Cup final for the first time in their history, Steve Bruce’s team claimed only seven top-flight victories in 2014, while their record at the KC Stadium was even worse. But after only three successes in 18 attempts, they could not have chosen better opponents as first visitors for 2015.\n\nHaving shipped three goals apiece in road trips to Southampton and Newcastle, Martínez reverted to the three-at-the-back system he previously employed at Wigan. However, it was to calamitous effect, as Hull preyed on Gareth Barry’s uncertain display on the left side of Everton’s central defensive trio throughout the opening 45 minutes. There were less than three minutes on the clock when Barry felled Hull’s Uruguayan striker Abel Hernández half a yard into the Everton area, only for the referee Kevin Friend controversially to award the hosts a free-kick on its perimeter.\n\nJevavic’s effort flashed over the top. Hernández, looking much more like the £10m player who scored on his Premier League debut in September than the peripheral figure of the autumn months, was simply irresistible. “It’s no secret that he’s found it difficult. He’s played three games then had to go halfway around the world for international duty. He’s had a baby – not physically, himself – three or four weeks ago. But he has proved here what a good player he could be for us,” explained Bruce, who also confirmed an interest in signing another international striker, England’s Jermaine Defoe, during this month’s transfer window.\n\nHull have lost several leads this season but the half-time introduction of Romelu Lukaku and switching of Ross Barkley to a more progressive position failed to eat into what Bruce termed Hull’s “most convincing” performance of the season. The unlikely figure of Elmohamady headed the Yorkshire club into the lead after outjumping Leighton Baines at the far post. Then, two minutes before the break, Jelavic punished Barry for trying to play offside by keeping his composure to control Hernández’s overhead flick and lob over a hesitant Joel Robles.\n\nEverton’s misery was compounded four minutes from time when Alcaraz walked for a contentious second yellow – an adjudged bodycheck on Jelavic.\n\nBy that stage, Hull had lost three of their own to serious-looking injuries as festive fatigue took its toll – Andy Robertson, Liam Rosenior and Gastón Ramírez all likely to be sidelined for some weeks.Man of the match Abel Hernández (Hull)"},

battle and Leicester City displayed it in abundance at Anfield. More importantly, it was their quality that stalled Liverpool’s momentum as Nigel Pearson and company went from raging at the referee, Mike Jones, at half-time to applauding a stirring fightback at the close. “We got what we deserved,” lamented Brendan Rodgers.\n\nThe Leicester manager reiterated his call for video technology after his bottom-of-the-table side conceded two penalties, one for a ball striking their captain, Wes Morgan, in the face. Their complaints were legitimate but should not overshadow the impressive performance that earned a deserved point against a sluggish, careless Liverpool side. A comfortable two-goal lead at half-time owed little to Liverpool’s display and almost everything to the match official but that luxury was squandered as easily as the ball on a trying afternoon for Rodgers.\n\n“We weren’t bright enough on the ball,” the Liverpool manager said. “We didn’t keep the ball for long enough and the rhythm of our passing was slower than normal. We were fortunate enough to get a penalty and then we found ourselves 2-0 up. That should be enough to play the game out but we made too many mistakes.”\n\nSteven Gerrard scored the two penalties – the first a joke, the second justified – as Leicester players railed at Jones and their coaching staff gathered at the top of the tunnel to berate the referee at half-time.\n\nPearson made his displeasure known before heading to the dressing room after a word with a police officer. “I spoke to him,” clarified the Leicester manager, who was fined £10,000 and given a one-match touchline ban over his recent spat with a fan. “He was there to manage the area. I spoke to him before the game, too. I haven’t been arrested.”\n\nJeffrey Schlupp equalises for Leicester City in the Premier League game against Liverpool. Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images\n\nLeicester were the more enterprising side and should have been ahead before Jones pointed to the spot for the first time. The impressive Riyad Mahrez, who scored the winner at Hull City that ended a run of six straight Premier League defeats for Pearson’s side, hit the woodwork after 66 seconds with a free-kick that deceived Simon Mignolet at his near post. Mahrez then squandered a glorious chance from Jeffrey Schlupp’s cross. The two wide men were a thorn in Liverpool’s side and will be sorely missed when they depart for the Africa Cup of Nations.\n\nLiverpool’s energy and intensity dropped from the highs of Monday against Swansea City but they were gifted a penalty when Raheem Sterling’s cross from the byline hit the diving Morgan in the face before connecting with his arm. The referee, who has the ‘beach ball’ goal against Liverpool among his litany of errors, decided otherwise and Gerrard, back in the starting lineup having been rested against Swansea, converted the penalty to the left of the goalkeeper Ben Hamer.\n\n“I’m not going to be ultra-critical but we could see what happened within seconds,” said Pearson. “We could make the officials’ job much easier if we utilised the technology that is available but we don’t and so this will keep happening.”\n\nHeads could easily have dropped, given Leicester’s position, but they continued to press, only to be undone by a second Liverpool penalty. This one was legitimate. Three blue shirts backed off Philippe Coutinho as he weaved down the left and his flick into the area struck Danny Simpson’s raised hand.\n\nJones called it right, Hamer dived the same way from the spot-kick but Gerrard went the other. Pearson said: “It hits his hand but it was unintentional. There is no consistency.”\n\nDavid Nugent replaced the injured Danny Drinkwater in the Leicester attack and should have pulled a goal back early in the second half with a free header from Matty James’ corner. That effort was glanced wide but the boyhood Evertonian made no mistake with a superb finish seconds later. A flowing passing move was rounded off in fitting fashion when James lofted a ball into the area, the tireless Jamie Vardy chested down to Nugent and the striker hitch-kicked a half volley into the

their way. This time, however, they spared themselves another ordeal and it was another moment to demonstrate why the Premier League champions have leant on their sister club, New York City FC, to keep Frank Lampard in Manchester rather than Manhattan. They may not like it in New York but when Lampard is making such a rich contribution for Manuel Pellegrini’s team the decision-makers in Abu Dhabi can hardly be blamed for deciding to extend his stay and abandon the initial plan of making him Major League Soccer’s new poster boy.\n\nLampard had been on the pitch only four minutes when he announced his presence with the fifth, decisive goal of a wild 15-minute spell that had felt utterly incongruous to everything that preceded it. It was his seventh goal for the club, despite largely being restricted to substitute appearances, and it is clear why City have been willing to risk a transatlantic PR disaster, which could conceivably get worse over the coming months.\n\nThe awkwardness of what has happened – leaving one supporters’ group in New York proclaiming themselves to be outraged – will hardly be eased by Pellegrini letting slip that he could not guarantee Lampard would even move to the United States at the end of the season, and the revelation that the former Chelsea player does not actually have a proper contract in place with the club that announced him as their signing last summer. Yet what cannot be disputed is the wisdom of the decision for City, the Mancunian version. Lampard, even at 36, has made himself almost indispensable when he is capable of getting his team out of a hole in this way.\n\nAfter 66 minutes, City had looked as though they would coast through the final exchanges, courtesy of a majestic shot from Yaya Touré and a delightful finish nine minutes later from Stevan Jovetic. Instead that was the cue for Sunderland to ditch their ploys of conservatism and, lo and behold, discover that City are vulnerable when they are put under pressure and missing their captain and chief organiser, Vincent Kompany. Gus Poyet later apologised for “boring” the crowd in the first 45 minutes and maybe in hindsight the Sunderland manager will regret not setting up his team to be more adventurous from the start, especially when Willy Caballero was in the opposition goal and had looked so erratic earlier in the season. Joe Hart had been given a day off, perhaps owing to a couple of mistakes in his past two games, and a more ambitious side might have done more to test Caballero.\n\nManchester City’s Frank Lampard celebrates after scoring the third goal against Sunderland. Photograph: Martin Rickett/PA\n\nPellegrini will certainly be startled by the way Jack Rodwell and Adam Johnson scored within three minutes of one another and the fact these are both former City players merely added to the feeling, following on from the 2-2 draw against Burnley, that the home side were in danger of suffering what used to be known here as the dreaded “Cityitis”.\n\nAs it turned out, we were reminded that the modern-day side found the cure a long time ago but that was an alarming period for City as Rodwell headed in from a corner and Johnson scored a penalty after Pablo Zabaleta had scythed down Billy Jones. Sunderland had barely ventured into the opposition’s half until that period, with Johnson and Will Buckley dropping back as extra full-backs and Rodwell playing just in front of defence. This was not the first time City have encountered these kind of smothering tactics but the game dramatically changed after the 57th minute when Touré let fly, 25 yards out, to score a beauty, still rising as it soared into the top corner.\n\nJovetic’s goal was clever in its own way, the forward playing the ball out to Gaël Clichy on the left and then continuing his run into the penalty area to meet the cross and flick the ball past Costel Pantilimon. At other times, City missed the attacking edge Sergio Agüero would usually provide. Touré was hugely influential, showing why he will be such a loss when he goes to the Africa Cup of Nations, with the prospect of missing matches against Chelsea and Arsenal. David Silva was also prominently involved, though not quite able to emulate his form of recent matches and perhaps showing a few signs of fatigue.\n\nCity do, however, have a great habit of holding their nerve when the heat of the battle is suddenly turned up. They responded to Johnson’s equaliser as if affronted by Sunderland’s temerity and missed more chances than they will care to remember in the final quarter of an hour. Lampard fits in seamlessly and his precise header, from another of Clichy’s left-wing deliveries, was the compelling evidence why one City’s gain is another’s loss.\n\nMan of the match Yaya Touré

"John Carver’s audition for Alan Pardew’s old job concluded with a smattering of boos and two dropped points. The jeers were a little harsh on a day that could hardly have provided more entertainment – albeit some of it was of the slapstick variety – but the caretaker’s increasingly anxious expression betrayed the reality that this was far from a vintage Newcastle United performance.\n\nWith Danny Ings, Ashley Barnes and George Boyd impressing, Burnley, surely a decent bet to avoid relegation, fully merited the draw and probably more at the end of a day in which they hit the woodwork four times.\n\nIf alarmingly slapdash displays from Fabricio Coloccini and Cheik Tioté threatened to cost Newcastle – and Carver – dear, Sean Dyche’s wonderfully attack-minded side deserve every plaudit going for equalising three times after losing a trio of players to illness and injury in the first half.\n\n“I’ve never been involved in a match where the cliche about a game of two halves was so apparent,” said Carver. “We were so good in the first half but so poor in the second. I’m so disappointed. We got a point we didn’t deserve.”\n\nHis gloom was exacerbated by Steven Taylor having almost certainly ruptured an achilles tendon. “It’s not looking good,” said Pardew’s former assistant, who expects the centre-half to be sidelined until next season. The loss of one of football’s good guys leaves Newcastle at least one defender short but Carver’s immediate concerns were purely human. “I’ve known Steven since he was in the centre of excellence and he’s a great lad,” he said.\n\nIronically, the afternoon began deceptively well for Taylor as, within minutes, he rose above Jason Shackell to head Jack Colback’s corner past Tom Heaton.\n\nCarver’s joy turned to horror as Burnley launched a long punt upfield that Paul Dummett inexplicably succeeded in heading beyond Jak Alnwick after Taylor’s initial intervention had directed it back towards Newcastle’s goalkeeper.\n\nDyche limbered up for the trip to Tyneside by taking his family to watch Cinderella and, as that equaliser from the home left-back flew in, Burnley’s manager must have felt he was back at the pantomime. Up in the stands the joke that Dummett must be the only Geordie who doesn’t know where Alnwick is – for those unfamiliar with the north-east, it’s a town in Northumberland – quickly did the rounds.\n\nAn earlier, similarly comedic, moment, resulted in Tioté, increasingly unreliable these days, carelessly conceding possession in the face of Ings. It preceded a pass to Barnes that resulted in the striker unleashing a curling shot that rebounded back off the inside of a post.\n\nAfter that it was all Newcastle for a while, with Colback compensating for Dummett’s own goal by meeting Daryl Janmaat’s pass and defying Heaton courtesy of a crisp, long-range shot.\n\nThe sense that it was not destined to be Dyche’s day seemed compounded by Burnley’s appalling luck. By the 36th minute the visitors had used up their full complement of substitutes, with Shackell hobbling off, Dean Marney succumbing to a violent vomiting bug and Kevin Long, who had replaced Shackell, being taken off on a stretcher with a potentially nasty ankle injury.\n\nTheories that fate was working against the visitors heightened further when Ings’s stellar, subtly swerving, shot bounced back off the underside of the bar before Barnes’s header from the rebound struck a post. Dyche’s almost disbelieving grimace suggested he had just been subjected to a particular barbaric form of torture. It got worse.\n\nWhen Coloccini, by now wobbly, erred, Ben Mee directed a close-range header against the bar. Dyche was reduced to sardonic shrugging but his smile returned when Ings – showing off the touch and movement that had made Pardew so keen to sign him – connected with Mee’s cross to finally register a richly deserved headed equaliser. With Newcastle’s first-half superiority a rapidly receding memory, there had been a feeling of growing inevitability about a goal that arrived shortly after Alnwick performed wonders to tip Boyd’s 35-yard shot over the bar.\n\nAlthough Moussa Sissoko polished off a rare home counterattack by lashing Ayoze Pérez’s classy cross out of Heaton’s reach there certainly remained no cause for Geordie complacency.\n\nSure enough, when Boyd met Ings’ pass he surged, imperiously, through the home defence before beating Alnwick with a low shot. Instantaneously, Carver’s new year was ruined.\n\nMan of the match George Boyd (Burnley)"}, {"date": "01/01/2015", "arena": "Kiyan Prince Foundation Stadium", "attendance": 17729, "home_team": {"name": "Queens Park Rangers", "lineup": [{"name": "Robert Green", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mauricio Isla", "yellows": [58], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Richard Dunne", "yellows": [62], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Caulker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Clint Hill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eduardo Vargas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Karl Henry", "yellows": [86], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joey Barton", "yellows": [74], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leroy Fer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [20], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bobby Zamora", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [83]}, {"name": "Charlie Austin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Armand Traore", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rio Ferdinand", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matt Phillips", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex McCarthy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nedum Onuoha", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordon Mutch", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Junior Hoilett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [83], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Swansea City", "lineup": [{"name": "Lukasz Fabianski", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Angel Rangel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Federico Fernandez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Williams", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Neil Taylor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leon Britton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sung-Yueng Ki", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathan Dyer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [60]}, {"name": "Gylfi Sigurdsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [71]}, {"name": "Wayne Routledge", "yellows": [], "reds": [86], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bafétimbi Gomis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Wilfried Bony", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [90], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [71], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marvin Emnes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [60], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Carroll", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gerhard Tremmel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Bartley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jazz Richards", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Modou Barrow", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "According to the Queens Park Rangers support, Raheem Sterling sleeps when he wants. Not here. Not when he had the presence of mind to revive a Liverpool team that had largely slumbered in west London and not at the very end, when his speed, technique and incision made the difference in a crazy late shoot-out.\n\nWhen Roy Hodgson, the England manager, who was watching from the stands, got up and left in the 83rd minute, he had seen Sterling stand out for a below-par Liverpool and help them into the lead. Fouled by a QPR substitute, Armand Traoré, he took the free-kick quickly, ushering Glen Johnson into a dangerous position and when the right-back crossed there was Richard Dunne, hanging out an ill-advised leg, to put through his own goal.\n\nHodgson had revealed that Sterling was too jaded to start for England against Estonia seven days ago, a revelation that triggered the storm over the last week and strained the relationship between the national team setup and Liverpool.\n\nIt was Hodgson’s stamina that could be questioned here. He missed four goals and the latest instalment of the sort of drama that the Premier League somehow serves up on a regular basis. Above all, though, he missed Sterling’s stealing of the show. QPR, who put in what Harry Redknapp said was the best performance of his tenure, twice thought that they had snatched what would have been a deserved reward with goals from another substitute, Eduardo Vargas.\n\nBut after each one Sterling switched on the afterburners to put Liverpool back in front. First, he initiated the break that led to Steven Gerrard finding Philippe Coutinho, who cut inside to finish with an excellent low shot and, at the death, he took a pass from Coutinho and played the ball towards Mario Balotelli. Incredibly, Steven Caulker diverted the ball into the net for the second own goal of the afternoon.\n\nQPR were left to lament how Liverpool had broken from Leroy Fer’s botched free-kick at the other end.\n\nIt was brutally hard on the home team, who had dominated the first half and created further chances in the second, including one for Traoré on 85 minutes, when he could not muster enough power in a close-range header. Martin Skrtel also cleared from in front of Vargas moments before Coutinho’s goal.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Brendan Rodgers says it is unfair to compare Mario Balotelli to Luis Suárez\n\nVargas was a major positive for Redknapp and QPR, who showed that they are still fighting for their under-pressure manager. The striker, who is on loan from Napoli, scored the first equaliser when he crossed from the right and continued his run to meet Charlie Austin’s header at the far post with a volleyed finish, and his second followed a corner from Fer. Vargas’ glancing header wriggled in at the near post where Joe Allen, a Liverpool substitute, ought to have done better.\n\nBut Sterling refused to accept any dropped points and his last-gasp run ensured that Liverpool did not have to. After their toils so far this season, particularly away from Anfield, Brendan Rodgers and the players needed this. Next up for them is Real Madrid in the Champions League at Anfield on Wednesday.\n\nLiverpool had been dismal in the first half, from back to front, and they were fortunate to have remained in contention. QPR had three glorious chances and when they missed them, it always seemed likely that they would come back to haunt them.\n\nAustin was denied one by Simon Mignolet after Johnson and Skrtel had missed tackles on him; Fer skimmed the top of the crossbar from point-blank range from Bobby Zamora’s cut-back and the midfielder also headed against the bar, with Mignolet having come for another Zamora cross and missing it. In the ensuing melee, Johnson jumped into a high tackle which might have led to the concession of a penalty before Liverpool scrambled the ball clear.\n\nLiverpool were overrun in midfield during the opening period, when they were beaten to several second balls, while the less said about Balotelli, the better. The centre-forward was a distant second-best in the physical battle with Dunne while his shooting was off-kilter. The worst from him, however, was still to come. On the hour, after Sterling’s incision and Adam Lallana’s shot, which was pushed out by Alex McCarthy, Balotelli sized up the empty net, eight yards from goal. He blazed his shot high. What. A. Miss.\n\nRodgers insisted afterwards that Balotelli’s first Premier League goal would come. Apart from Gerrard’s 44th-minute effort, when he jinked and curled narrowly past the far post, Liverpool had nothing to show for themselves in the first half but they were better in the second. Rodgers moved Gerrard from the No10’s role to a deeper-lying midfield position and Sterling ran hard and directly. In a stuttering team, the winger’s relentlessness is hugely impressive.\n\nQPR lost Nedum Onuoha and Sandro to injuries – the latter had forced Mignolet into a reflex save early in the second half – but Sterling came to transcend the afternoon. The former QPR youth player angered the home crowd with his reaction to Liverpool’s first goal but he brought them to their knees in stoppage time.\n\nMan of the match Raheem Sterling (Liverpool)"}, {"date": "01/01/2015", "arena": " Mary's Stadium", "attendance": 31492, "home_team": {"name": "Southampton", "lineup": [{"name": "Fraser Forster", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Toby Alderweireld", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "José Fonte", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Florin Gardos", "yellows": [67], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [71]}, {"name": "Ryan Bertrand", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Davis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Wanyama", "yellows": [23], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Ward-Prowse", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sadio Mané", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [34], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [42]}, {"name": "Dusan Tadic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [56], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [85]}, {"name": "Graziano Pellè", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Kelvin Davis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Maya Yoshida", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [71], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shane Long", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [85], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lloyd Isgrove", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harrison Reed", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [42], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jason McCarthy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matt Targett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Arsenal", "lineup": [{"name": "Wojciech Szczesny", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mathieu Debuchy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [84]}, {"name": "Per Mertesacker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Laurent Koscielny", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kieran Gibbs", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Calum Chambers", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [60]}, {"name": "Francis Coquelin", "yellows": [74], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Santi Cazorla", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tomas Rosicky", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alexis Sánchez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Theo Walcott", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [60], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nacho Monreal", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Emiliano Martinez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joel Campbell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chuba Akpom", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [84], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Hector Bellerin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ainsley Maitland-Niles", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Wojciech Szczesny reached into the back of the net for his bottle and he took a long glug. The only pity for the Arsenal goalkeeper was that there was nothing stronger in it than water. Szczesny had just erred for the second time to present Dusan Tadic with the second Southampton goal and his grab for the bottle felt like an instinctive defence mechanism. Perhaps he wanted something to do with his hands.\n\nIt were his feet that had been the problem on this occasion. Following Steven Davis’s wonderful control and cross from the right, Mathieu Debuchy had jabbed the ball back at Szczesny and he seemed to panic that it represented a back-pass. So he swiped at it with his boot and succeeded only in finding Tadic, who squeezed home his shot. “Maybe it was a new year’s present from them,” Ronald Koeman, the Southampton manager, said.\n\nKoeman’s team led through Sadio Mané after Szczesny’s first bad decision of the day – a reckless bolt from his line – and they were value for the points, having played the slicker football and created fistfuls of chances. Graziano Pellè was twice denied by the post and Koeman admitted that when his only criticism of the players in a game against Arsenal was their failure to score the killer third goal, pretty much everything must have gone to plan.\n\nArsenal had their chances, principally through Santi Cazorla at 0-0 and the relentless Alexis Sánchez at 1-0 but they did not do enough to merit anything. No team can make the mistakes that they did at the back and emerge unscathed. Arsène Wenger had finally been able to play his full-strength back five but the dawn of the new year was marked by familiar errors. They struggled to cope with the bullying presence of Pellè and, in particular, high balls over the top.\n\nSouthampton strengthened their grip on fourth place but, for Arsenal, there was the latest check to their momentum. They have still to win three Premier League games in a row this season. “Every time we look like we can get on a run, we have a hiccup,” Wenger said.\n\nSadio Mané, left, rounds Arsenal goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny before scoring Southampton’s opening goal. Photograph: Tim Ireland/AP\n\nThe opening goal had Wenger shaking his head. Mané bustled in behind Laurent Koscielny, following James Ward-Prowse’s high ball forward and, after Szczesny had dashed from his line and then retreated, he lofted a curling left-footed chip from a tight angle over the goalkeeper.\n\nIt was a beautiful finish but Koscielny ought to have done better and Szczesny’s positioning was haphazard. Things might have got worse for Arsenal before the interval but Szczesny saved smartly with his legs from Ward-Prowse after Mané’s cut-back.\n\nMané was promptly forced off, having seemingly been injured in his goal celebrations. Koeman was unclear on the nature of the Senegalese’s problem but, with the Africa Cup of Nations looming, he hoped that it was not too serious.\n\nSouthampton made in-roads up the flanks and they should have been in front much sooner. Pellè headed Tadic’s seventh minute cross against a post while he forced Szczesny into a scrambling save from Ryan Bertrand’s centre.\n\nSánchez was typically sharp and inventive. He worked Fraser Forster from distance in the early going while he also absorbed heavy challenges from Florin Gardos and the excellent Victor Wanyama.\n\nArsenal’s big chance came on 21 minutes, when Tomas Rosicky cut back smartly for Cazorla but the first-time shot was directed at Forster, who beat clear. It was a glaring miss. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain also went close following Cazorla’s pull-back.\n\nSánchez might have put a different complexion on the game in the 55th minute when he fastened onto Oxlade-Chamberlain’s cross, jinked and shot – Forster made a fine low save – and, moments later, Southampton were further in front through Tadic.\n\nThey threatened to inflate the scoreline. Tadic twirled majestically and curled just wide; Pellè hit the near post from Bertrand’s cross, with Ward-Prowse lifting the follow-up high, and Debuchy cleared off the line from Pellè after Tadic had read Koscielny’s poor back-pass and got around Szczesny.\n\nThere was controversy on 68 minutes. Sánchez sprinted clear and he was halted by Florin Gardos’s foul on the edge of the area. “A definite red card,” Wenger said, but the referee, Stuart Attwell, reached for yellow. Sánchez curled the free-kick over the cross-bar. It was not Arsenal’s day.\n\nMan of the match Victor Wanyama (Southampton)"}, {"date": "01/01/2015", "arena": "Upton Park", "attendance": 34914, "home_team": {"name": "West Ham United", "lineup": [{"name": "Adrián", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Carl Jenkinson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Collins", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Winston Reid", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Cresswell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex Song", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Morgan Amalfitano", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [55]}, {"name": "Cheikhou Kouyaté", "yellows": [4], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stewart Downing", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andy Carroll", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [84]}, {"name": "Diafra Sakho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [10], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [72]}], "subs": [{"name": "Kevin Nolan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matthew Jarvis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [55], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mark Noble", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joey O'Brien", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jussi Jaaskelainen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Carlton Cole", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [84], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Enner Valencia", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [72], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "West Bromwich Albion", "lineup": [{"name": "Ben Foster", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andre Wisdom", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gareth McAuley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joleon Lescott", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Baird", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Morrison", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Youssouf Mulumbu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [67]}, {"name": "Graham Dorrans", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [79]}, {"name": "Stéphane Sessegnon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Brunt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Saido Berahino", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [42], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [73]}], "subs": [{"name": "Claudio Yacob", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [67], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Brown Ideye", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [73], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Boaz Myhill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cristian Gamboa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Craig Dawson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Silvestre Varela", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [79], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adil Nabi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Marvel at the Tony Pulis effect. Although the presence of the Premier League’s leading troubleshooter in the stands at Upton Park was not quite enough to lift his new side to an unlikely victory over West Ham United, this was an encouraging first step in the right direction for West Bromwich Albion, who took heart from a display that belied their status as relegation candidates. On this evidence, they can be hopeful of staying up with a degree of comfort.\n\nIt was a mark of how well Albion coped that the final whistle was greeted by a smattering of boos from the home fans, a harsh reaction when this result is placed into the context of what West Ham have achieved so far this season. There was a leggy feel to West Ham at the end of an energy-sapping run of games and there were complaints about them sending a few too many long balls in the direction of the ineffective Andy Carroll for the crowd’s liking.\n\nBut the draw kept them within touching distance of fourth-placed Southampton and, in that sense, Sam Allardyce’s side are victims of their own success. Considering the shambolic state they found themselves in at the start of 2014, life could be worse.\n\nThey could, for instance, be West Bromwich Albion. Something had to give after their 2-0 defeat at Stoke City on Sunday ended with their supporters in open mutiny and, putting it bluntly, no one was surprised when the news filtered through that Alan Irvine had been sacked on Monday night. There is no point sugarcoating the issue: Irvine was doomed from the start and the club had to act. The bloody-mindedness of Crystal Palace’s escape under Pulis last season has instantly restored optimism at Albion.\n\nPulis, whose first proper match in charge will be when non-league Gateshead visit The Hawthorns in the third round of the FA Cup on Saturday, left it to Keith Downing and Rob Kelly to take caretaker charge, although his assistant, Dave Kemp, popped up in the dugout in the second half. Kelly said that Pulis offered his new players a few words of advice, before adding that much of the preparation was done by Irvine. It may well turn out to be Kelly and Downing’s final hurrah at the club, with Pulis likely to replace them with his own backroom staff.\n\nAlbion will be disappointed that summoning the inspiration that might have brought them a first win in four matches was beyond them but this may come to be seen as a valuable point in the final reckoning. They are a point above third-bottom Palace and they were resilient when they had to be in the second half to stretch West Ham’s winless run to three matches.\n\nThe fear for West Ham was that Pulis’s arrival would give Albion a new lease of life and the visitors played some pleasing football in the first half. Stéphane Sessègnon, whose tricky footwork and easy dribbling style would make him a genuine force if only he were more consistent, was a source of creative menace and his dash down the left three minutes before the interval created Saido Berahino’s equaliser.\n\nAlbion displayed strength of character to recover from falling behind in the 10th minute, West Ham taking the lead with a beautifully crafted goal. Stewart Downing sent a searching pass sailing over Joleon Lescott’s head and Morgan Amalfitano was able to bring the ball down and find Aaron Cresswell, whose fizzing cross was headed into the far corner by Diafra Sakho for his ninth goal in all competitions.\n\nYet Sakho later went off with a back injury and West Ham will suffer when he and Cheikhou Kouyaté head off to the Africa Cup of Nations with Senegal next Monday. Allardyce also admitted that there is a chance that Alex Song could yet be called up by Cameroon after initially being left out last week.\n\nIt would be a blow for West Ham if Song goes. They have misplaced their spark in the past week and there are concerns that it is impossible to replicate the flowing football they were playing a couple of months ago when Carroll, who is not the most mobile of forwards, is in their attack.\n\nGradually Albion asserted themselves and Adrián had to make an outstanding save from Chris Baird’s surprisingly acrobatic volley, before West Ham were exposed when Sessègnon broke and rolled the ball inside to Berahino, who alerted any potential suitors this month to his qualities by coolly scoring for the first time in 12 matches.\n\nWest Ham could hardly plead ignorance given that it was Berahino’s third goal in four matches against them and the closest they came to a winner in the second half was when Cresswell’s free-kick hit the base of Ben Foster’s left post. Albion stood firm.\n\nMan of the match Stéphane Sessègnon (West Bromwich Albion)"}, {"date": "01/01/2015", "arena": "White Hart Lane", "attendance": 35903, "home_team": {"name": "Tottenham Hotspur", "lineup": [{"name": "Hugo Lloris", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Walker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Federico Fazio", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jan Vertonghen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Rose", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [44], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [76]}, {"name": "Nabil Bentaleb", "yellows": [66], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Mason", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [14]}, {"name": "Andros Townsend", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [45], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [66]}, {"name": "Christian Eriksen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nacer Chadli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [78], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Kane", "yellows": [87], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [30, 52], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Vlad Chiriches", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paulinho", "yellows": [72], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [66], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Roberto Soldado", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michel Vorm", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mousa Dembélé", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [14], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Benjamin Stambouli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Davies", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [76], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Chelsea", "lineup": [{"name": "Thibaut Courtois", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Branislav Ivanovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gary Cahill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Terry", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [87], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "César Azpilicueta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cesc Fàbregas", "yellows": [82], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nemanja Matic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willian", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [72]}, {"name": "Oscar", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Eden Hazard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [61], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Diego Costa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [18], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Petr Cech", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kurt Zouma", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ramires", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Didier Drogba", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Mikel Obi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mohamed Salah", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [72], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Loïc Remy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "This was the evening Chelsea’s title pursuit, for the first time this season, was made to look fragile. Even unlikely. A side who pride themselves on an ability to ally thrilling attacking play with stingy defence were picked apart and embarrassed across the capital, wilting in the face of Tottenham Hotspur’s eager energy and attacking threat, and eclipsed by a homegrown forward who has never played better. Memories of this riotous occasion will sustain Harry Kane through the winter.\n\nThe England Under-21 international scored twice, earned a penalty and supplied Nacer Chadli with the hosts’ fifth as the majority in this arena revelled in a victory that felt barely credible. José Mourinho’s teams are not thrashed in this way. Never before had he conceded four while in charge of Chelsea, and this was only the second time in a 14-year managerial career the Portuguese had watched powerless as his charges shipped five. The new year has already seen their lead at the top shredded. Manchester City boast an identical record at present courtesy of a winning goal plundered by Frank Lampard up at the Etihad stadium earlier in the day. Those at the top are separated only on alphabetical order. The race has another twist to digest.\n\nPerhaps fatigue played its part, with this a third awkward away trip in four matches in a congested period, but frailties which had not previously been apparent were exposed too often across Chelsea’s back line for comfort. Spurs may have been clinical, but the visitors were brittle and all the complaints about the non-award of a penalty when Oscar prodded a ball against the grounded Jan Vertonghen’s arm smacked of deflection tactics. There were real deficiencies here to spark concern, rather than conspiracy theories to expose.\n\nNemanja Matic was unable to stamp his usual authority on this contest. Gary Cahill has quelled the threat of Lionel Messi and Luis Suárez at times during his career, but Kane left him dazed and confused. The centre-half’s frustration erupted when the ball was stuck under the forward’s body on the touchline late on, the kicks to the back and calf apparently not noticed by the referee, Phil Dowd. The Football Association may choose to scrutinise that incident more carefully in the days ahead.\n\nIn truth, the entire Chelsea defence appeared flustered and uncharacteristically vulnerable, disconcerted by the aggressive running of Chadli and Andros Townsend down the flanks but, most of all, by Kane’s excellence. The forward is improving with every outing, his display here the best of a fledgling career to date from the moment he collected on the left and cut in-field with Oscar hesitant. Free of a challenge, the striker merely skimmed a shot into the corner from 20 yards and, instantly, the hosts’ conviction was stoked.\n\nTottenham Hotspur’s Harry Kane celebrates his equaliser. Photograph: KIERAN GALVIN/EPA\n\nTottenham were rampant in what little time remained up until the interval, Christian Eriksen scuttling forward to liberate Chadli behind Cahill. Thibaut Courtois charged to the edge of his area to intercept but his compatriot’s shot was poked beyond the goalkeeper and on to the far post, with Danny Rose bravely belting in the rebound to record a first league goal here since a derby winner on debut against Arsenal in April 2010. He was bruised while converting, though not as wounded as the visitors. Chelsea were still wheezing in disbelief when Cahill upended Kane as the striker appeared on his blindside. Townsend, the third youth-team graduate turned goalscorer, thumped in the resultant penalty.\n\nMourinho attempted to wrest back some control by introducing Ramires at the interval but his team’s rearguard were shellshocked. When Chadli pinned back Branislav Ivanovic and shifted possession inside to Kane, the young English forward turned Matic far too easily and curled a fourth through John Terry’s legs with Courtois helpless. The fifth, converted by Chadli, also flicked off the centre-half. “Chelsea are one of the best in the world, at Real Madrid level,” offered Mauricio Pochettino. This was the first time in eight attempts that he has beaten a Mourinho team. “A great victory. We deserved the victory. We were better than Chelsea.”\n\nJosé Mourinho fumes at ref Phil Dowd and says Eden Hazard is unprotected Read more\n\nThey were still anxious at times, particularly in the period after Diego Costa had pilfered an early lead. Eden Hazard had collected Courtois’ 60-yard throw, retained his balance under Rose’s challenge and struck the far post with a shot. Costa dangled a leg at that effort from an offside position but Oscar collected at the far post and, when he fired back across the diving Hugo Lloris, the forward poked in legitimately from close-range. The visitors’ other rewards were plucked from a game of catch-up, Hazard skipping forward to exchange passes with Cesc Fàbregas to make it 4-2 and Terry tapping home the Belgian’s cross for 5-3. A thrill in the attacking play was retained, but this was a performance undermined by slackness at the other end. The advantage at the top is no more, with only one win secured in five away games. Christmas has not been kind to the leaders.\n\nMan of the match Harry Kane (Tottenham)"}, {"date": "29/12/2014", "arena": "Anfield", "attendance": 44714, "home_team": {"name": "Liverpool", "lineup": [{"name": "Simon Mignolet", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Emre Can", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Skrtel", "yellows": [49], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mamadou Sakho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Javi Manquillo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lucas Leiva", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordan Henderson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alberto Moreno", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [33], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Lallana", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [51, 61], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [77]}, {"name": "Raheem Sterling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [83]}, {"name": "Philippe Coutinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}], "subs": [{"name": "Kolo Touré", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Gerrard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rickie Lambert", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fabio Borini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mario Balotelli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [83], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lazar Markovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [77], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Ward", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Swansea City", "lineup": [{"name": "Lukasz Fabianski", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jazz Richards", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Federico Fernandez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Williams", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Neil Taylor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leon Britton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [67]}, {"name": "Jonjo Shelvey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [69], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathan Dyer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gylfi Sigurdsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [52], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wayne Routledge", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wilfried Bony", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [62]}], "subs": [{"name": "Sung-Yueng Ki", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [67], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marvin Emnes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Carroll", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bafétimbi Gomis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [62], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Angel Rangel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gerhard Tremmel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Bartley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Liverpool ended 2014 as they began it. Their defence can still cause palpitations from the most harmless situations but, more importantly for Brendan Rodgers, the relentless attacking threat that underpinned their title challenge and then went awol made its return against Swansea City.\n\nGarry Monk’s men, like so many at Anfield last season, struggled to find a solution. Swansea contributed to their own demise with Lukasz Fabianski handing one goal to Adam Lallana and Jonjo Shelvey completing the scoring for his former club. There could be further punishment for the Swansea midfielder from the Football Association after he threw an arm into the face of Emre Can. Liverpool’s Raheem Sterling, too, may be sweating for raising a hand to his provocateur Federico Fernández, but otherwise this was a performance to savour from the forward triumvirate of Sterling, Lallana and Philippe Coutinho.\n\nAll three were afforded standing ovations as they departed from Liverpool’s biggest home win of a trying season. All three displayed the movement, touch and creativity that Rodgers’ team have lacked without Luis Suárez and Daniel Sturridge and were at the heart of several sweeping moves that illustrated how confidence is returning at Anfield. Lallana finished off the best in style, his gradual improvement indicative of that belief now flowing through the Liverpool team.\n\nRodgers said: “In the last two or three weeks the performance level has been much closer to what we were over the last 18 months. A lot of hours have gone into finding a tactical idea that allows us to get back to that. Apart from a ridiculous spell after we scored the second goal when we gave the ball away cheaply, conceded one and did our best to give them another goal, it was a real dominant performance.”\n\nLiverpool rarely allowed Swansea out of their own half before the interval as they controlled proceedings and tested Fabianski through Martin Skrtel, who collected a fifth booking of the season and will miss Leicester City’s visit on New Year’s Day, Sterling and Coutinho. The Germany Under-21 midfielder Can started in central defence and was not flustered until being smacked in the face by Shelvey’s flailing arm. Shelvey had been told before the game by his manager to “wise up” against needless bookings. He is not one for taking advice.\n\nSterling’s indiscretion was not as dangerous but the match officials missed both incidents and retrospective action may follow. Monk did not see the incident and intended to review it on the journey home. Rodgers said: “I have seen the two incidents. The cameras will probably show them 100 times and we will get bored of watching it. I think the referee called both right and got on with the game.”\n\nLiverpool took the lead through one of many incisive attacks, though not many usually commence with a good ball out of defence by Mamadou Sakho. The France international sent Alberto Moreno scurrying down the left, he found Lallana, who in turn released Jordan Henderson to the byline. Moreno continued his run into the penalty area and converted from close range when the cross arrived despite Fabianski’s best efforts on the line. Swansea made a more determined start to the second half but undermined their chances of recovery with a comical error. Not that anyone connected with the visitors, and Fabianski in particular, was laughing. The former Arsenal goalkeeper was presented with what should have been a routine clearance by Ashley Williams’ back-pass. Instead, and seemingly oblivious to the in-rushing Lallana, he attempted to sweep the ball out wide and succeeded only in hitting the Liverpool player who reeled away in delight as the ball dropped into the unguarded net.\n\nLiverpool’s hopes of a second successive clean sheet were extinguished within a minute when Can and Sakho failed to clear crosses and Gylfi Sigurdsson buried a simple finish. Wilfried Bony was denied an equaliser by Simon Mignolet as Rodgers’ side wobbled but, with Lallana and Coutinho in confident mood, Liverpool regained absolute control.\n\nLallana’s second goal of the night, Liverpool’s third, was an outstanding reminder of what last season’s title challenge was based upon. Henderson played a simple pass to Coutinho who sent the £25m summer signing sprinting through the centre with an exquisite backheel. The former Southampton captain drifted away from Fernández and Àngel Rangel before burying a fine finish into the far corner.\n\nLiverpool’s fourth completed a miserable return to Merseyside for Shelvey, who somehow glanced Henderson’s corner to the near post beyond his own goalkeeper and into the far side of the Swansea net. Monk looked on aghast at Swansea’s latest act of self-destruction but this was a night when Liverpool recaptured their flair."}, {"date": "28/12/2014", "arena": "White Hart Lane", "attendance": 35711, "home_team": {"name": "Tottenham Hotspur", "lineup": [{"name": "Hugo Lloris", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Vlad Chiriches", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Federico Fazio", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jan Vertonghen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Davies", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Benjamin Stambouli", "yellows": [26], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Mason", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andros Townsend", "yellows": [27], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [79]}, {"name": "Christian Eriksen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nacer Chadli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [79]}, {"name": "Harry Kane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Kyle Walker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paulinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Roberto Soldado", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Erik Lamela", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [79], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michel Vorm", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eric Dier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mousa Dembélé", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [79], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Manchester United", "lineup": [{"name": "David De Gea", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Jones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paddy McNair", "yellows": [71], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [76]}, {"name": "Jonny Evans", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [72]}, {"name": "Michael Carrick", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Antonio Valencia", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Juan Mata", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wayne Rooney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Young", "yellows": [50], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robin van Persie", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Falcao", "yellows": [84], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Rafael", "yellows": [86], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Luke Shaw", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [76], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Smalling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [72], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Anders Lindegaard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Darren Fletcher", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andreas Pereira", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Wilson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Louis van Gaal, unlike his Manchester United team, had not run out of steam. The manager shot from the hip after this largely forgettable stalemate, mixing a little bit of sugar with plenty of spice.\n\nUnited, he said, had produced the best first-half performance of his tenure but he knows that they are not going to win any titles if they display this level of profligacy. He referenced the chances that Radamel Falcao, Robin van Persie and Juan Mata missed across the piece yet it was in the first period that his team failed to capitalise.\n\n“When you play your best first half of the season and you are playing in White Hart Lane, and playing a top-six club, and you create six to eight open chances, then you have to finish them,” Van Gaal said. “If you don’t reward yourself, normally the opponent wins. When you cannot win these type of matches when you are the better team – like at Aston Villa [before Christmas] and also now – then it is very difficult to be the champions at the end of the season.”\n\nVan Gaal was not exaggerating with his assessment of the first-half chance count – Falcao and Van Persie wasted the best ones – but at least his team did not succumb to the second-half sucker-punch that is so often a feature of matches that follow those patterns.\n\nTottenham advertised it. As United faded, the home team were more competitive; they were quicker to the second ball and they extended David de Gea. There was also the moment when Harry Kane released Ryan Mason but the midfielder lifted his shot over the crossbar.\n\nTottenham had two appeals for a penalty: the first, after Paddy McNair clipped Kane – the Tottenham striker stumbled but, crucially, he kept his feet – and the second towards the end, when Wayne Rooney manhandled Kane following a corner. Mauricio Pochettino, the Tottenham manager, said that both of them should have been given, although grabbing inside the area hardly comes with the cast-iron assurance of an award.\n\nIt was Van Gaal, not Pochettino, who could grumble about the fairness of the scoreline and his argument was based on a first half in which Mata excelled and Ashley Young made inroads from left wing-back.\n\nUnited had the ball over the Tottenham line in the 23rd minute only for an offside flag against Falcao in the middle to nullify Phil Jones’s header at the far post while Mata’s deflected free-kick hit a post. Vlad Chiriches cleared in the ensuing melee ahead of Falcao.\n\nRooney’s touch had let him down in the early going, following Mata’s ball over the top, and Falcao twice failed to muster sufficient power in his shots after getting in on Hugo Lloris’s goal. On the first occasion the Colombian was put off by Federico Fazio’s challenge.\n\nLloris deserved his man-of-the-match champagne and it is getting to the point where his excellence barely raises an eyebrow. “He is one of the best goalkeepers in the world,” Pochettino said. “I say the same thing every week.”\n\nThe goalkeeper thwarted Van Persie at close quarters, after the striker had taken down Michael Carrick’s high ball and then taken a less-advised second touch, and the goalkeeper beat away Young’s long-range curler which was bound for the top corner. Van Persie had been clean through. His was a glaring miss.\n\nThere was niggle, not least involving Van Persie, who had a running battle with Jan Vertonghen. Falcao also tumbled theatrically after Vertonghen had caught him with a stray hand. Van Gaal invaded the personal space of the fourth official, Lee Mason, to protest at an early decision; Rooney nagged at the referee, Jon Moss, who showed six yellow cards, and Pochettino had his grievances too. This is what happens when football cancels Christmas for footballers.\n\nVan Gaal warmed to a familiar theme when he complained about how it had been impossible for the players to recover from the Boxing Day fixtures and he said that his three defensive substitutions were because of tiredness. “The second half was not football any more,” he said. “It was a struggle for life.”\n\nTottenham pressed on to the front foot as the game wore on, which was the latest testament to their fitness and Andros Townsend, Fazio and Christian Eriksen each worked De Gea. United, though, were left to lament gilt-edged misses in the second half by Van Persie and Mata. Both of them blazed high following crosses from the right.\n\nVan Gaal sounded an upbeat note when he declared that United would “of course” be better in 2015. Yet this was an afternoon of frustration, when the ball would not go in.\n\nMan of the match Hugo Lloris (Tottenham Hotspur)"}, {"date": "28/12/2014", "arena": " Mary's Stadium", "attendance": 31641,

Fàbregas was disgusted with the yellow card that the referee, Anthony Taylor, showed him early in the second half and the replays supported his case.\n\nMourinho launched into an impassioned outburst afterwards about “a campaign” against Chelsea and he also called for television replays to be shown to referees when they have made a clear mistake. As always he sounded as if he believed every single word but, despite rightful grievances about the latest incident, if his team are suffering from a reputation, then a good part of that, undeniably, is of their own making.\n\nOn a more positive note their response to Sadio Mané’s 17th-minute goal, preceded by a rare positional lapse from John Terry, showed all their qualities of resilience and togetherness. Terry’s expertise has been a considerable factor in why this was the first time Chelsea have conceded a goal in their last four league matches. On this occasion, however, he was caught in two minds between going for the ball and trying to maintain a defensive line and managed to do neither. At 34 Terry’s legs were not going to spare him and Mané, played onside, ran on to Dusan Tadic’s pass before having the composure and presence of mind to lift a bouncing ball over the oncoming Thibaut Courtois.\n\nAt that stage Southampton looked full of energy and spirit and the ironic chants of “the Saints are staying up” were noisily reminding everyone about the frequency with which they were portrayed as relegation possibilities, rather than Champions League hopefuls, at the start of the season.\n\nSchneiderlin and Victor Wanyama were quick to the ball and strong in the tackle, preventing Fàbregas and Nemanja Matic from dominating the midfield in the way that happened after the interval. Hazard, such a menace throughout the second period, was subdued in the opening half an hour and Matt Targett, one of the teenagers from Southampton’s conveyor belt of seemingly endless young talent, had slotted in so harmoniously that his direct opponent, André Schürrle, was substituted by Willian at half-time. Targett is a 19-year-old left-back of rich promise on this evidence, even if he was grateful to be given the benefit of the doubt after the incident that led to Fàbregas’s booking when it could conceivably have been a penalty decision. There was clear contact between the two players even if Southampton could argue it was Fàbregas moving into his opponent rather than the other way round.\n\nChelsea took their time to get going but the pattern of the game changed in first-half stoppage time when Fàbregas lifted the ball into the path of Hazard, running through the inside-left channel, and the Belgian was set free for the first time. Hazard, wanting the ball on his right foot, still had plenty to do and had to cut inside the full-back, Maya Yoshida, as well as the nearer centre-half, Toby Alderweireld. He did so brilliantly, finding the space to take aim, and fired his shot into the far corner with power and precision.\n\nMourinho’s team had so much of the ball after the break that they will be exasperated by their inability to create more chances. Diego Costa had one of his least productive games and, for all the menace of Hazard and Fàbregas, Fraser Forster in Southampton’s goal was surprisingly underworked given how much time the ball spent in and around his penalty area.\n\nAlderweireld showed again what a fine centre-half he is and Ronald Koeman made a sensible decision to replace a tiring Yoshida given that the defender was facing the elusive Hazard and had already been booked.\n\nDidier Drogba immediately started to trouble his opponents when he came off the bench but the best chance for Chelsea came from a mistake by the substitute James Ward-Prowse and a misplaced back-pass that threatened to undo all of Southampton’s defensive work. Costa lost his footing when he had the opportunity to run clear and the home side held on after Schneiderlin’s foul on Fàbregas, following an earlier booking for one on Hazard, left them a man down during the final exchanges.\n\nMan of the match Eden Hazard (Chelsea)\n\nSouthampton (4-2-3-1) Forster; Yoshida (Gardos 62), Fonte, Alderweireld, Targett; Wanyama, Schneiderlin; S Davis (Long 77), Mané, Tadic (Ward-Prowse 58); Pellè.

"report": "There is a theory that the festive period produces more goals than usual but Aston Villa and Sunderland predictably reverted to type on an afternoon when the home team were forced to play with 10 men for the third time in four matches. Fabian Delph’s dismissal early in the second half, after a lunge on Jordi Gómez, handed the initiative to the visitors, but the closest a toothless Sunderland side came to a breakthrough was when the Spaniard hit a post in the 89th minute.\n\nIn truth it was a stalemate waiting to happen. Villa have now scored only 11 times in 19 league fixtures – a dismal tally – while Sunderland, who have drawn six of their last nine matches, also average less than a goal per game. No prizes for guessing what department of the pitch needs some fresh blood in the January transfer window.\n\nWhile Gus Poyet departed frustrated that his Sunderland side had failed to make their numerical advantage count – Connor Wickham and Adam Johnson both had decent opportunities in the second half – Villa, for whom Carlos Sánchez once again impressed in central midfield, were not without their own chances, even after Delph was sent off.\n\nThat red card – Villa’s fourth of the season – woke everyone up after a soporific first half. Lunging for the ball following a short Sunderland throw-in, Delph planted his studs on the top of Gómez’s left foot. The initial reaction was that Delph was unfortunate to be dismissed by the referee, Martin Atkinson, and that a yellow card would have sufficed. However, television replays showed that Delph’s challenge, although reckless rather than malicious, did not look too clever.\n\nPaul Lambert said that he would review the footage before deciding whether to appeal, although the Villa manager did not sound overly hopeful. “I never really saw it the first time. But I’ve seen it once on replay. It’s a hard one. Martin couldn’t have had a better position. I don’t think there was any malice in it, the same as the Kieran Richardson one [against West Bromwich]. But the modern-day game now, you probably don’t need to have much contact and that can happen.”\n\nPoyet, who worked with Delph at Leeds, had some sympathy for the England international and suggested that the player’s “reputation” may not have helped. “It’s unlucky, I think,” said the Sunderland manager. “Saying that, if you see it tonight, stop the video and you see his studs on his ankle, if it’s another three inches, it could be a broken leg, so it was dangerous. Sometimes you get away with those tackles, and that’s the way that Fab plays. It’s good to change him, but he brings something extra to the pitch and sometimes that extra bit can get a red card.”\n\nA bigger issue for Poyet was the disappointing way that Sunderland responded to Delph’s dismissal. Johnson shot tamely at Brad Guzan from 10 yards and Wickham was unable to force the ball home from six yards in the space of three minutes midway through the second half. That was as good as it got for Sunderland until Gómez arrowed a 20-yard drive against the woodwork. “I think we lost a great opportunity today, it’s disappointing not to take the three points, especially after the sending off,” said Poyet, who lost Liam Bridcutt to concussion and Sebastian Larsson to an ankle injury. “I think we tried too hard, we went a little bit crazy and lost the shape.”\n\nLambert, who joined Poyet in railing against the idea of playing two games in the space of three days, admitted that Villa needed to improve their disciplinary record, although the Scot insisted that it would be unfair for his players to pick up a reputation for being “a dirty team”.\n\nTo their credit, Villa continued to press for a winner with 10 men, but Costel Pantilimon kept out Ron Vlaar’s glancing header and also denied Leandro Bacuna, seconds after Gómez’s chance at the other end.\n\nMan of the match: Carlos Sánchez (Aston Villa)\n\nAston Villa: (4-3-3) Guzan; Hutton, Vlaar, Clark (Okore, 61), Cissokho; Delph, Sánchez, Cleverley (Grealish 68); Weimann, Benteke, N’Zogbia (Bacuna 57)\n\nSubs not used: Given, Herd, Lowton, Robinson.

but often emerging with nothing. This win, therefore, pleased him no end, prevailing after weathering a late Hull City storm, digging deep in the face of sustained pressure to secure a first win in 14 games following Riyad Mahrez’s fine first-half strike.\n\nIt was all the sweeter for Pearson given that it was against one of his former clubs; his return to the KC Stadium pushed the Tigers deeper into the relegation scrap. Steve Bruce’s side sit 17th after this defeat, out of the bottom three on goal difference. They failed to break down Leicester in the closing stages when both sides were reduced to 10 men by red cards to Paul Konchesky and Stephen Quinn.\n\nLeicester remain bottom but the significance of this victory must not be underestimated. Pearson’s side had not won since beating Manchester United in September, enduring a terrible run since then that has featured 11 defeats. How they needed a piece of quality here and it was Mahrez who provided it, the Algeria international scoring with a superb strike.\n\nBruce had described this game as “bigger than the FA Cup final” but his side failed to stir themselves sufficiently during an insipid first-half display that only sparked to life once Mahrez struck. Hull improved as the game wore on but their pressure came too late. When Phil Dowd called time the natives were restless.\n\nThe sight of Pearson applauding the Leicester supporters after full time did not ease Hull’s pain but the relief was evident among the blue shirts. “It’s been a long time since we’ve talked about winning a game,” said Pearson. “You need a bit of luck from time to time and we’ve certainly not had much in this long run of ours. I’ll be the first to admit that we didn’t play as well as we can play. The qualities that we showed today, we’re going to need from hereon in.\n\n“I think there is external pressure, people talking about [being] bottom at Christmas. We know that we’ve got capabilities and we will try and strengthen as well. It was a big game. Losing today would have meant that we were losing touch. We are still in a very difficult situation so let’s not kid ourselves with the relief. We’ve got to try and push on from this.”\n\nEsteban Cambiasso and Matty James started in midfield for Leicester and although Hull held the upper hand in the first half the home side were woefully short of ideas in the final third. The sucker-punch came when Mahrez received the ball from David Nugent, cut inside and finished beautifully into the bottom corner from 25 yards.\n\nIt set up a frantic end to the half and Ahmed Elmohamady was guilty of an awful miss at the far post following a fine cross from Quinn, but he scuffed his first-time effort over the bar.\n\nBruce responded at half-time by bringing on Nikica Jelavic for Gastón Ramírez but it was Abel Hernández’s introduction that provided extra impetus in attack. The striker rattled the post with a header and in the aftermath Curtis Davies’s shot was cleared off the line by Marcin Wasilewski, amid unsuccessful appeals for handball.\n\nJake Livermore then hit the post and Hernández blazed over in the dying seconds from close range after Konchesky had been sent off for two bookings, before Quinn followed him down the tunnel for a handball when he was the last man, preventing Nugent from running through.\n\nBruce said: “We’ve been in the Premier League for 18 months, I can’t remember having so many chances at this level. But you’ve got to score. It turns into one of those awful afternoons when you don’t deserve to get beaten.\n\n“When you get beaten fair and square that’s fine. When you don’t deserve it, it leaves a bad taste. It’s given Leicester a lifeline.

If Burnley had been defeated, the champions would have notched a club record 10th consecutive win and, as Chelsea dropped two points at Southampton, Manuel Pellegrini’s team would be one behind the London club.\n\nInstead a second-half crumble meant Burnley might have grabbed a famous first victory since 1974 against City and the Sky Blues can be happy their unbeaten run remains intact. The fragility at the back that has troubled City all season had been evident in the first half and, within moments of the second commencing, it proved costly.\n\nGeorge Boyd seemed to have the final touch for a finish that may have fooled Joe Hart, otherwise the goalkeeper will be disappointed not to have saved a Burnley goal that derived from Danny Ings’ cross.\n\nOf this a proud Sean Dyche said: “I have no clue and I’m not interested. I know it went in and that was my main concern. I actually haven’t seen it; someone said it is offside. All I would say is, a scratch of luck when you’re Burnley, we don’t always get that, so we’ll take that gladly.”\n\nWhile City had dominated until then and taken a 2-0 lead into the break, this was no surprise. There had, though, been an earlier eyebrow-raiser when the official word went out before kick-off that Yaya Touré had been “rested” for this one. The Ivorian is off to the Africa Cup of Nations sometime around the Everton game of 10 January, so the expectation was that Pellegrini would use him as much as possible.\n\nHowever, it emerged that Touré has a groin injury. The manager hopes his star midfielder will be available for the New Year’s Day visit of Sunderland.\n\nThis meant Fernandinho and Fernando were in tandem in central midfield for only the third time, and only the second in the league. The pair and the rearguard behind them cannot have been content at how Burnley were able to rattle City before and after David Silva’s opener.\n\nNot for the first time this season Eliaquim Mangala was shaky as Burnley pinged the ball around. One move culminated in a Kieran Tripper cross being narrowly missed by a stretching Ashley Barnes and later Boyd was able to make a nuisance of himself before Dean Marney fired straight at Hart.\n\nIngs was also allowed to run at City through the centre and unload a shot that sailed over the bar as Burnley predominantly troubled the champions along Trippier’s right-back corridor.\n\nWhen roving forward City looked a team coasting in low gear who might punish the visitors at will. Martín Demichelis missed an early chance at the far post from a corner, Samir Nasri had an attempt blocked by Trippier and, after slick interplay from Silva and Jesús Navas, City’s “false” No9, James Milner, failed to finish.\n\nSilva’s sixth club goal of the season came after Nasri fed Navas down the right. The Spaniard was found and, following a sweet pivot, he beat Tom Heaton.\n\nThat was on 23 minutes. Fernandinho’s first goal of the season came after the half- hour and left the Burnley goalkeeper scant chance. Nasri laid off to the Brazilian – Boyd might have got tighter – and Fernandinho drilled a beauty of a 25-yard finish that bent and crashed in off Heaton’s bar.\n\nAs the break approached Pablo Zabaleta clashed heads and required treatment but one of City’s most reliable soldiers merely picked himself up, had a headband applied and continued.\n\nBoyd’s goal was the catalyst for Burnley to look for more and eventually draw level. Their equaliser came when Zabaleta gave away a free-kick near the centre circle. This was launched into the City area by Jason Shackell, the visiting captain, and, when Mangala proved a weak presence, Barnes finished from his own knockdown after it pinballed back to him.\n\nDyche said: “I thought Ashley Barnes, that was arguably one of the best centre-forward performances I’ve seen in a long, long time, especially against this standard of player. You’ve got to remember his journey, he’s come from lower leagues, he’s earned and fought for the right to play at this level, so why wouldn’t he take his chance? If anyone sums up playing with freedom, he encapsulated that with an absolutely fine performance and a sublime finish.”\n\nCity will spend the time before Sunderland’s visit on Thursday berating themselves. They suffered because of a lack of ruthlessness in front of goal and the more concerning powder-puff quality of their defending.\n\nManchester City (4-2-3-1) Hart; Zabaleta, Demichelis, Mangala, Kolarov; Fernandinho (Sinclair, 88), Fernando; Navas, Silva, Nasri (Lampard, 71); Milner (Jovetic, 62).

However, Keith Millen, beginning his third stint as Crystal Palace’s caretaker manager following Saturday’s dismissal of Neil Warnock, could at least take satisfaction from a hard-fought away point though given how beatable the home side looked, he would have been entitled to regret not climbing out of the relegation zone by improving a run that now reads one win in 13 Premier League matches.\n\n“It was really important that the lads showed a real togetherness and spirit,” Millen said. “That’s what we’ve been about for the last two years. You could see the response of the players, I was very proud of them. It’s been a shock what happened [with Warnock] so it was important to bounce back.”\n\nMillen made a single alteration to the line-up that started Warnock’s final match, with Fraizer Campbell replaced by Wilfried Zaha. A paucity of goals was one of the main problems during Warnock’s short reign and the caretaker manager sought to remedy that by dispensing with specialist strikers and putting his trust in Zaha to provide penetration in front of an advanced supporting cast of Jason Puncheon, James McArthur and Yannick Bolasie.\n\nThe ploy did not work as Zaha fluffed a couple of clear chances in the first-half before being substituted midway through the second. In the 22nd minute he bungled his attempt after Puncheon’s delicate shot from the edge of the area rebounded to him off a post. He also dragged a shot wide from 15 yards after a goalkick found its way through to him.\n\nDespite being toothless, Palace were the more inventive and dynamic of two teams low on precision. Rangers displayed a grim lack of creativity, with hoofs in the general direction of Bobby Zamora their default tactic. Palace’s defence, aided by Mile Jedinak, dealt with that approach easily for most of the match.\n\nCharlie Austin had to scavenge for any chance to add to his impressive goal tally for the season, though he did produce the first shot on target in the 15th minute when his own cross came back to him off Adrian Mariappa and he sent a stinging half-volley goalwards from the edge of the box. Julián Speroni saved comfortably.\n\nQPR could hardly blame fatigue for their stodginess as Harry Redknapp made six changes to the side that had come close to scrounging a first away point of the season when they gave Arsenal a fright on Boxing Day. Their deplorable results on the road place them under added pressure to collect points at home, especially against fellow strugglers such as Palace, but even Redknapp admitted they did not deserve more than a draw here.\n\nRangers improved marginally in the second period. In the 48th minute they could almost claim vindication for their long-ball strategy, when Mariappa’s clearance of a mighty diagonal delivery fell to Leroy Fer, whose volley from 20 yards flew narrowly wide. Ten minutes of largely artless skirmishing followed before Fer went close again, this time forcing Speroni to tip a ferocious 25-yard shot over the bar.\n\nPuncheon almost struck on the counterattack for Palace, his curling shot from 20 yards bringing a one-handed save from Rob Green. McArthur had to clear a Steven Caulker header off his line in the 74th minute following a corner by Joey Barton. A corner from the same side in the 87th minute provoked further unease in the visiting defence but Junior Hoilett granted them a reprieve by slashing wide from 15 yards.\n\nPalace players appealed for a penalty in added time when Campbell tumbled under a challenge by Barton, who was attempting to atone for miscontrolling the ball after Green turned away a Puncheon shot. But afterwards Millen did not quibble with the decision of the referee to wave play on, while Redknapp said that Campbell admitted to Green that he had slipped rather than suffered a foul.\n\nThat

he can steer them out of trouble despite a seventh league defeat in nine games that left the team lying 16th, a point above the relegation zone.\n\nWest Bromwich performed creditably until they succumbed to two second-half goals from the Senegal player Mame Biram Diouf – the first well taken, the second a fortuitous deflection – which secured Stoke’s second win of the holiday period.\n\nAfterwards Irvine, who was subjected to some vitriolic abuse from the away fans at the final whistle, was asked if he will still be in post in the new year. He replied: “I hope so but I’m not in control of that, so I don’t know. I want to carry on. I want to still do this job and I want to see it turning around, and that is not going to change.”\n\nIrvine added that he understood the supporters’ anger. “I can understand fans expressing that frustration. That is the nature of the job. If anyone is to take it, I am the person that is standing there. I stand out there and I don’t hide – I’m there to be shot it. And, obviously, ultimately, I make the final decisions so certainly I’m prepared to take the criticism.”\n\n“I don’t know if the fans would have necessarily wanted me to acknowledge them [at the end]. What do you do in those circumstances? I just walked down the tunnel. I am bitterly disappointed as well - it means an awful lot to me, and I know it means an awful lot to them.”\n\nWest Bromwich had matched Stoke until the 51st minute when Diouf opened the scoring, firing home right-footed, although the ball may have taken a slight nick off Joleon Lescott on its way into the net. His second 15 minutes later came with a large measure of luck, the ball deflecting off Diouf and past the goalkeeper Ben Foster from Marko Arnautovic’s drive. West Bromwich went close to an equaliser between Diouf two goals but Gareth McAuley’s effort hit the post.\n\nFor Stoke this victory, following the 1-0 win at Everton on Boxing Day, lifted them to 10th place and their manager, Mark Hughes, said: “Back-to-back wins is really important, and clean sheets as well – that is really encouraging.”\n\nHe acknowledged that losing Diouf in January for the Africa Cup of Nations will be a blow. “We are going to miss him, but hopefully Senegal get knocked out quickly,” he joked.\n\nStoke 4-4-2 Begovic; Cameron, Shawcross, Muniesa, Pieters; Nzonzi, Whelan (Wilson, 85),Arnautovic, Bojan (Adam, 78), Diouf, Crouch (Walters, 63).\n\nSubs not used Huth, Butland, Assaidi, Shenton.\n\nWest Bromwich 4-4-2 Foster; Wisdom, McAuley, Lescott, Baird; Morrison (Varela, 63), Dorrans (Mulumbu, 80), Gardner, Brunt; Sessègnon (Berahino, 63),Ideye.\n\nSubs not used Yacob, Myhill, Gamboa, Dawson.\n\nBooked Brunt, Baird.

Arsenal may be patched up and makeshift, a team depleted by injuries to key personnel, but they are inching inexorably back towards familiar territory. West Ham had been a refreshing and worthy presence in the top five but they have been usurped. Only goal difference is keeping Arsène Wenger’s team out of the Champions League places.\n\nThat can be addressed on New Year’s Day when another of this season’s success stories, Southampton, are confronted at St Mary’s, but the sense is Arsenal are reimposing themselves on the pack. Every other member of the top seven dropped points on Sunday and this is a seventh win in nine games in all competitions, a revival that has almost gone unnoticed with the focus instead drawn to the deficiencies exposed in defeat at Stoke and the draw at Liverpool amongst that sequence of successes. Nine consecutive wins against these opponents says otherwise but triumphing at Upton Park is no mean feat these days. “A solid, combative and united performance from first to last,” said Wenger. “It was more a fight today than a creative game but you need that sometimes.”\n\nHe had reason to be encouraged. It had been a test of mettle, particularly given Arsenal had played for 37 minutes with 10 men in beating Queens Park Rangers on Boxing Day and, given their crammed treatment room, have precious few options to make sweeping changes to their lineup. At times in the opening 40 minutes when Alex Song and Cheikhou Kouyaté strode purposefully around the Hammers’ midfield and dominated the occasion, with Aaron Cresswell and Morgan Amalfitano lively on the flanks, the visitors had been horribly stretched but they also proved resilient.\n\nSong’s 20-yard volley was ruled out because Diafra Sakho and Kouyaté were deemed to be distracting Wojciech Szczesny from offside positions, and James Tomkins volleyed wastefully over the bar. Yet out of West Ham pressure Arsenal conjured a two-goal lead in a frantic passage of play before the interval and effectively settled the contest.\n\nSanti Cazorla’s dart into the penalty area provoked panic, Winston Reid losing his footing but lifting a leg to trip the Spaniard and concede a penalty. Cazorla converted that with glee and with West Ham players still incensed at the award and distracted in their frustration, Arsenal struck again.\n\nAlex Oxlade-Chamberlain burst to the byline and fizzed a centre through Reid’s legs and into the six-yard box where Tomkins was dawdling. Danny Welbeck slid in to score at the defender’s back.\n\nIf West Ham were perplexed to find themselves behind then Kouyaté’s headed goal, having leapt above Mathieu Debuchy to meet Tomkins’ centre, suggested another shift in momentum. Yet their huff and puff would yield nothing but disappointment and Enner Valencia nodded on to the roof of the net deep into stoppage time.\n\nSam Allardyce’s complaints centred on Song’s volley six minutes in. “[Sakho] wasn’t in the eye line of the keeper and he didn’t touch the ball,” said the manager. “The ball went through his legs and he’s standing three yards to the right of Szczesny. [The referee] Neil Swarbrick cannot have a clear view whether Sakho is in the goalkeeper’s eye line or not.\n\n“Cast your mind back to Everton away and [Romelu] Lukaku’s goal was allowed to stand even though the ball had ricocheted off our player to him when he was offside, and he scored. I’m completely confused and bewildered. But if ours today had been allowed to stand we wouldn’t have lost. It would have kicked the lads on and, given our recent home record, Arsenal would have found life very difficult from then on.”\n\nIn truth, only the excellence of Adrián in the home goal prevented Arsenal restoring their two-goal lead late on, with the Spaniard delivering a flurry of fine saves.\n\nAllardyce will be confident his team’s upward trajectory can be restored when West Bromwich Albion visit on New Year’s Day but they are playing catch-up to Arsenal now. “To be in the top four is vital for us, and it’s all still to do,” said Wenger. “But we have done it 17 years [in a row], so I’m entitled at least to believe we can do it again.” His team are quietly rising through the ranks.

Fortunately for Alan Pardew, Craig Pawson, the referee, was looking elsewhere at the time and, shortly afterwards, Cissé’s equaliser set Newcastle United on course for a hugely restorative win.\n\nIt left Everton stuck in a disappointing mid-table position and Roberto Martínez ruing bad luck. “There are days when nothing goes in your favour,” said the manager. He had one particular moment in mind. “Elbowing a fellow professional is unacceptable. It should have been spotted. It’s a clear elbow which is trying to hurt someone and those are not actions we want to see on a football pitch.”\n\nPardew’s view on the matter remained unknown as he avoided all post-match media commitments. Whether or not he was playing political games with Mike Ashley or genuinely fancies the Crystal Palace vacancy remains to be seen but John Carver, his assistant, was giving nothing away in the wake of Newcastle arresting a run of four straight defeats.\n\n“I was eating a pie when Alan asked me to do the press,” said Carver, who claimed not to have seen Cissé’s transgression.\n\nInitially fortune appeared to be frowning on the home dugout. Martínez’s decision to offer Arouna Koné his first Premier League start for Everton while leaving Romelu Lukaku to warm the bench was vindicated, emphatically, in the fifth minute.\n\nWith Yoan Gouffran caught out of position, Aiden McGeady’s delivery deceived Paul Dummett, permitting Coleman to dispatch a fabulous, low, right-wing cross which the unmarked Ivorian striker lashed, gratefully, beyond Jak Alnwick from close range. After 18 largely injury-plagued months on Merseyside it was Koné’s first goal since swapping Wigan for Goodison Park in a £6m move.\n\nPardew at once rejigged his formation, relocating Moussa Sissoko from the right and placing his key midfielder in a more central role with Ayoze Pérez switching to the flank.\n\nWith Everton ruffled, Cissé, making only his sixth start this season, registered his ninth goal of the campaign in the 34th minute. It is far from a shabby tally for a player still clearly troubled by complications in a knee following surgery last April. The striker’s expertly volleyed equaliser, after being cued up by Cheick Tioté’s cross and Mike Williamson’s far-post flick-on, was characteristically accomplished.\n\nCissé was somewhat fortunate to be on the pitch, having earlier caught Coleman in the cheek with his elbow in an incident that seemed worthy of a red card. Not that the Senegal striker is likely to evade justice entirely. If Pawson’s report confirms he did not spot the swinging arm, the Football Association can be expected to use video evidence to punish Cissé retrospectively.\n\nWith the impressive McGeady frequentlyunsettling Pardew’s players – Gouffran in particular – and Everton looking a little wobbly whenever Moussa Sissoko ran at them, the game was in the balance for a while.Attempting to regain the initiative, Martínez introduced Ross Barkley at half-time, withdrawing James McCarthy whose effectiveness had been reduced by both a yellow card and a tight hamstring.\n\nA couple of exciting cameos from the newcomer meant all eyes were on the England international but this was destined to be neither his nor Everton’s day.\n\nWhen McGeady conceded possession, Tioté’s through-ball picked out Pérez’s fast feet in the 51st minute. After taking a steadying touch the former Tenerife forward beat Joel Robles courtesy of an excellent shot dispatched through Coleman’s legs and into the bottom corner.\n\nDusk had long since descended but Pardew’s horizon brightened further when Barkley’s attempt to intercept Janmaat’s through-ball resulted in a heavy touch which merely succeeded in nudging the ball into Jack Colback’s path. It left Colback to slip a shot beneath the advancing Robles in the 68th minute for his first goal since swapping Sunderland for Newcastle, celebrated in front of the Gallowgate End.\n\nKevin Mirallas, on as a substitute, ensured a tense finale by chipping Alnwick after Leighton Baines’ splendid pass caught the home defence square with six minutes remaining.\n\nMan of the match Ayoze Pérez (Newcastle United)\n\nNewcastle United: (4-2-3-1) Alnwick; Janmaat, Williamson, Coloccini, Dummett; Tioté, Colback; Pérez, Sissoko, Gouffran (Cabella, 90); Cissé (Rivière, 73).

The dissatisfaction expressed post-match had been at the prospect of a double training session at Cobham on Saturday. Chelsea have so little to complain about at present, with their progress at the top of the division utterly serene.\n\nThis was a fifth successive win in all competitions since they suffered their only defeat of the campaign, at Newcastle in early December, with the manner in which they strolled beyond a resurgent West Ham United a measure of the authority propelling their title pursuit. A derby against a side who began in the Champions League places should have been awkward but ended up more of a breeze. Mourinho reconsidered his schedule and duly rewarded his players by bringing forward the warm-down session to be undertaken at Stamford Bridge. His players can rest up, still three points clear at the top, before their trip to Southampton on Sunday.\n\nThere was no call for tears. This all seemed rather routine, the latest victory to sustain a pristine home record achieved courtesy of Nemanja Matic’s power in the centre, with attack-minded team-mates buzzing off his presence. John Terry and Diego Costa scored the goals which set Chelsea apart but only the excellence of West Ham’s goalkeeper, Adrián, prevented a rout. His saves from Oscar and Matic late-on were outstanding when gloss might have been applied to the scoreline. “But the results are good, the performances are quality, the players are doing well,” said Mourinho. “My team are playing well. As a coach I feel good with the people surrounding me, which is something I had been missing for a while. Now I have again a group that I love.”\n\nIf that was damning of his latter days at Real Madrid, then it is easy to see why he is relishing life back at Chelsea. There was so much slippery movement in this display, Eden Hazard, Willian and Oscar for ever tearing into their markers and exploiting space while West Ham, uncharacteristically ponderous from the outset, were left dizzied by it all.\n\nJames Collins and Carl Jenkinson will struggle to banish memories of Hazard. Without the reassurance of Alex Song at the base of the midfield from the start, the Cameroonian initially among the substitutes, West Ham were vulnerable. Sam Allardyce bemoaned a lack of spark, the ball shipped sideways too often. “They got too sucked into a negative style passing it sideways and backwards instead of forwards into the right areas,” said the manager. “And as good as Chelsea were, as talented as they were, the goals we conceded were so avoidable.” It was sloppiness in possession which proved properly damaging. All that alleged “19th-century football” last January had earned West Ham a draw here. An attempt at a more expansive brand yielded nothing.\n\nThere was an irony that Chelsea’s lavish approach did not yield them a lead. The opener was more brutal in its construction, Cesc Fàbregas’s corner flicked goalwards by Costa and the striker having lured Collins towards him, an unmarked Terry converted his 36th Premier League goal with ease. Yet the reward had long been coming, with other opportunities spurned, Oscar in particular guilty from point-blank range early, and the visitors consistently picked apart. Matic was untouchable in midfield, an interceptor liberating Fàbregas’s creativity at his side. The visitors might have been spurred into a riposte by a sense of injustice that Branislav Ivanovic was not penalised for going to ground too easily in first-half stoppage time, but by the time Allardyce reacted to fling on Song and Diafra Sakho just before the hour, a salvage mission was unlikely.\n\nCheikhou Kouyaté duly lost the ball in midfield, Hazard slipped Costa free for the Brazil-born forward to tease space from Collins and Jenkinson before drilling a left-foot shot across Adrián and into the far corner for a 13th league goal of term. That West Ham rallied late-on, Morgan Amalfitano drifting a header wide and then clipping a post after wriggling clear of Gary Cahill and Terry, seemed more of an afterthought. This had not been a display worthy of their recent form and Chelsea had eased off, confident victory was theirs, with the manager’s willingness to scrap his post-match plans an indication of faith in his playing staff.\n\nPlayers gathered on the pitch for their warm-down, the unused substitutes enjoying a quick game as groundstaff hovered to attend to the turf. Southampton, who have leapfrogged West Ham to return to fourth place, will pose their own threat but, for now, Mourinho’s team appear untouchable.\n\nMan of the match Nemanja Matic (Chelsea)\n\nChelsea 4-2-3-1 Courtois; Ivanovic, Cahill, Terry, Azpilicueta; Fàbregas, Matic; Willian (Ramires, 86), Oscar (Mikel, 83), Hazard; Diego Costa (Drogba, 83).\n\nSubs not used Cech, Filipe Luís, Zouma, Schürrle.\n\nWest Ham United 4-3-3 Adrián; Jenkinson, Reid, Collins, Cresswell; Kouyaté, Noble (Song, 59), Nolan; Downing (Amalfitano, 74), Carroll (Sakho, 59), Valencia.\n\nSubs not used Jaaskelainen, Jarvis, O’Brien, Cole.\n\nBooked Collins, Cresswell, Reid.\n\nAttendance 41,598.

With just seven wins from 18 matches there is still work to do in the second part of the season but at least they made a start here, playing a patient game that gradually wore down Burnley’s resistance.\n\nIn the first half especially Liverpool were a long way from irresistible but they kept possession better the longer the game went on and in Sterling they possessed the sort of matchwinner Burnley would dearly love to have, someone capable of seizing on the most fleeting of opportunities and taking full advantage. Sterling is still learning as a centre-forward, it is not his normal position, and he finished his one opportunity with much more aplomb than he showed in similar situations when one on one with David de Gea in the recent defeat at Old Trafford.\n\n“Playing in that position Raheem will get those chances because of his pace,” Brendan Rodgers said. “He’s been working on his finishing and he is learning fast. He showed great composure with his finish, and that’s what I told the players we needed as half-time. As a team we were more composed in the second half.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Brendan Rodgers predicts a strong finish to Liverpool’s season\n\nThis is not the easiest of grounds to visit for teams low on confidence and Rodgers will have been pleased to earn three points, particularly as the Liverpool goalkeeping saga took another unexpected twist after 16 minutes when Brad Jones’s “indefinite” stay between the posts came to an end. The Australian pulled a thigh muscle taking a kick, was unable to get anywhere near a Danny Ings shot that struck the foot of a post in Burnley’s first real attack, and seconds later Simon Mignolet was sent on in his place. The Belgian’s concentration does not appear to have been improved by the events of the past two weeks. He sliced his first clearance towards the touchline and took so long over his second that Ings almost charged it down. Unsurprisingly, he had the home crowd on his back after that, every time the ball came his way.\n\nMignolet and his defenders reached the interval without further incident, though by the end of the first half Burnley were doing almost all the attacking, with an Ashley Barnes header and a George Boyd shot the closest they came to opening the scoring. While Liverpool had begun brightly enough, with Sterling finding plenty of space and Philippe Coutinho picking him up with pinpoint deliveries, by midway through the first half too many passes were going astray, Lazar Markovic was unable to bring his pace to bear on the left, and Sterling and Coutinho became isolated. Adam Lallana did bring a save from Tom Heaton but it was just about all the Burnley goalkeeper had to deal with in the first half.\n\nLiverpool improved when Emre Can came on for the second half, though the action remained stodgy until the deadlock was broken just past the hour.\n\nNeither side was creating much and Burnley were perhaps just starting to think a point might not be the worst of outcomes when Coutinho and Sterling combined in an instant to create a goal out of nothing. All it took was a lofted prod forward by the former for the latter to run on to, and Sterling’s pace did the rest. Just about managing to stay onside, he turned into space and took the ball round an over-committed Heaton to score into an empty net in front of the Liverpool supporters in the Fishwick Stand.\n\nThere was still time for a little more goalkeeping drama, Mignolet letting a backpass roll out for an unnecessary corner when he had all the time in the world to clear it, but Burnley were unable to take advantage. Although Sam Vokes made a welcome return for his first appearance of the season Ings found little space in which to work and Burnley were unable to put a clearly vulnerable Mignolet under any sustained pressure. For a team in their position that has got to be a worry.\n\n“We dominated for good spells of the game, against Liverpool, but the challenge is to win,” Sean Dyche said. “We accept that, we’ve just got to make better chances for ourselves.

It was not a complete cruise for Ronald Koeman’s team but they fully deserved a victory that takes them back into the top four. Palace, meanwhile, are headed in the opposite direction, this defeat sending them into the relegation zone and cranking up the pressure on their manager, Neil Warnock.\n\nSadio Mané was the first to exploit the space that Southampton found in the opposing half, shooting his side into the lead in the 17th minute. The Senegalese beat Scott Dann to a flicked-on ball and laid it back to James Ward-Prowse before spinning and darting forward to collect the midfielder’s deft return pass as the entire Palace defence watched motionless. A duplicitous feint was enough for Mané to elude Julián Speroni and the forward, who has often been guilty of rashness since joining in the summer, kept his composure to slot the ball into the unguarded net from a difficult angle.\n\nSouthampton might have been expected to build on that lead seeing as they had been the better side up to the goal, Alderweireld having forced Speroni to push a surprising half-volleyed lob on to the bar in the third minute and Graziano Pellè heading over at the near post in the sixth minute. However, Palace mounted an uprising that had the visitors fretting for much of the remainder of the first period. Scoring has been a recurring problem for Warnock’s side, though, which is why the club are seeking new strikers in January, with Swansea City’s Bafétimbi Gomis top of their wish list.\n\nMile Jedinak is Palace’s top scorer with five thanks to his prowess from set pieces and he brought a solid save from Fraser Forster in the 26th minute from a free-kick. Southampton were again set up in the 3-5-2 formation that Koeman introduced for the victory over Everton in their last match but Palace found occasional gaps in central defence.\n\nThe biggest one emerged in the 32nd minute when Jedinak’s header ran through to Fraizer Campbell, who was not offside despite the flag from the assistant referee, who may have been grateful to see the striker’s shot cannon back off the crossbar. Southampton tightened up after that and Alderweireld produced an excellent block at the edge of the area to thwart Yannick Bolasie in the 40th minute.\n\nAt half-time Palace no doubt told themselves they could still overturn their deficit despite only having found the net once in the four matches prior to this one. But their recovery prospects soon took a severe turn for the worse.\n\nIn the 48th minute Mané, whose shift to a more central role than usual yielded perhaps his best display for Southampton on the day he was named in his country’s preliminary squad for the forthcoming Africa Cup of Nations, twisted his way past Joel Ward and delivered a cross that fell to Bertrand, who whacked a ferocious right-footed shot into the net from the edge of the box.\n\nFive minutes later Ward was found wanting again as Alderweireld soared above him to head a corner from Ward-Prowse into the net to plunder his first goal for Southampton.\n\n“Their goals are all very, very poor,” fumed a frustrated Warnock. “We’ve had a chat about that after. The first was a sloppy goal … and to lose two within seven minutes [of the resumption after half-time] does kill you. I’ve told people in the dressing room what I feel about the goals. It wasn’t Southampton’s fantastic play, it was our poor defending.”\n\nPalace continued to plug away and in the 86th minute they earned a reward that even Koeman admitted they deserved, when Dann headed into the net following a Jedinak free-kick.\n\nCrystal Palace Speroni;

Against Mark Hughes’ side, however, there was only familiar torment; a lack of creativity, pace and guile.\n\nWith Bojan Krkic’s match-winning penalty arriving seconds after the referee, Lee Mason, showed Jonathan Walters a yellow card for a professional foul on Leighton Baines, there was also controversy to complete Everton’s miserable Christmas. “We are not in a good moment but we got nothing from the referee,” said the Everton manager. “We had the same referee at Sunderland [in November] where he gave a penalty against the last man but not a red card. Today it was a clear goalscoring opportunity. The referee gives a free-kick but only a yellow card. He has to give a red or nothing. It is a really bad sign to see the same referee making the same mistakes.”\n\nHughes, unsurprisingly, claimed it was a clear yellow for Walters as he said the incident occurred too far from the Stoke goal. Ultimately, and regardless of Mason’s decision, Everton never got close enough to it. “We stopped Everton playing balls down the sides of us and through gaps,” said the Stoke manager. “They didn’t ask too many questions of us in the second half.”\n\nMartínez claimed it is the “footballing compliment” of opponents “doing different things and changing the way they play when they are facing us” that is responsible for Everton’s underwhelming league campaign. The reality is no one has had to reinvent the wheel to stifle his team and Stoke, with two compact, hard-working banks of four, were the latest side to expose a lack of ingenuity in the Everton ranks.\n\nThe home side awoke from a sluggish start and should have been ahead, complete with a one-man advantage, before Stoke went in front. First Kevin Mirallas’ low shot deflected off Glenn Whelan and sailed narrowly wide of the near post. The resulting corner from Mirallas dropped to Gareth Barry at the back post but the midfielder miscued and the ball sailed across the face of goal. Then came the controversy.\n\nBarry picked out Baines running behind the Stoke defence and the England left-back was hauled to the ground by Walters, his position as the last man beyond dispute. Baines was not in control of the ball but closing in on a perfectly weighted pass. The referee took the easy option and seconds later Goodison’s fury erupted when Mason pointed to the\n\npenalty\n\nspot after Krkic broke down the left, cut inside James McCarthy and went down under a touch from the Everton midfielder. Krkic tucked the spot-kick inside Howard’s right hand post.\n\nMirallas squandered a glorious chance to level during the extended injury time, Steven Nzonzi cleared off the line from Steven Naismith and Martínez was forced to replace his goalkeeper, and also his captain Phil Jagielka, during the interval due to knocks. Everton’s endeavour could not be faulted in the second half but they created precious little and Stoke absorbed the pressure comfortably.\n\nMan of the match Ryan Shawcross (Stoke)"}, {"date":

results, Nigel Pearson said this week, he would not still be in his job and once again the manager had to watch his side fail to get the reward their unstinting effort unquestionably deserved.\n\nWith 11 defeats and two draws in 13 games, the point at which the club’s owners decide something has to change may be approaching. With City five points adrift at the bottom of the table, Sunday’s match at Hull City could have huge implications.\n\n“I would love to have a crap performance that yielded three points but that’s how football is,” said a sighing Pearson, whose side had 22 attempts on goal compared with eight for Spurs. “The run we’re in is unusual based on the types of performances we’re producing but there’s no point me moaning. People who play the luck card are probably kidding themselves. What I can’t do is hide from the fact our results are nothing short of poor but we’ll keep working because I know the players are capable.”\n\nIt is rarely a good sign when the home crowd lapses into dark humour, even less so when some are still finding their seats. Barely a minute had elapsed when Érik Lamela, having seen Harry Kane forced to check his initial run, picked out Nacer Chadli running into space on the left.\n\nChadli’s pull-back looked rather scuffed but Kane, demonstrating upper-body strength as well as awareness and touch, got in front of Wes Morgan, controlled the ball and with Morgan on the ground, had the time to fire back across the City goalkeeper, Ben Hamer, from no more than six yards. It was the 21-year-old’s 13th goal in his past 18 games.\n\n“You’re nothing special, we lose every week,” came the chant from the stands but there was nothing resigned about Leicester’s response on the pitch. Leonardo Ulloa’s volley brought an unnecessarily spectacular save from Hugo Lloris but thereafter the France goalkeeper was at his considerable best, and had to be.\n\nJeffrey Schlupp and Riyad Mahrez forced him to make good saves but Lloris could only watch in relief as Ulloa’s header from a Riyad Mahrez cross came back off the inside of the keeper’s left post. At the other end Nabil Bentaleb, put clear, should have at least made Hamer make a save but the Algeria midfielder’s heavy touch gave Paul Konchesky the chance to clear.\n\nThe goal that City’s pressure deserved came less than three minutes into the second half. Mahrez’s persistence on the right helped him squeeze past Bentaleb and Ulloa wrestled himself in front of his marker to turn the ball past Lloris at the near post.\n\nMahrez soon struck a free-kick sweetly over the Tottenham wall, only to see the ball bounce back off the angle of post and bar. Schlupp’s stinging drive from an angle was palmed away by Lloris and, in the circumstances, the manner in which the visitors retook the lead seemed doubly cruel.\n\nWhether Christian Eriksen was trying to squeeze his free-kick from a distant angle inside Hamer’s right post only he can know. But, when the two-man wall split, the goalkeeper, who had been anticipating a cross, failed to scramble back across his line in time to keep the ball out.\n\nLeicester renewed their pressure,and Morgan, sliding in at the far post, narrowly failed to get sufficient contact on the ball to turn it over the line. In added time Lloris picked up a bloodied lip as he got to the ball fractionally before the committed Jamie Vardy.\n\n“When we talk about Hugo, we talk about one of the best goalkeepers in the world,” said the Tottenham manager, Mauricio Pochettino.\n\n“We managed [the game] for 25, 30 minutes but Leicester are a very good team, their supporters pushed them and I think they played very well in the second half. But we made a big, big effort.”\n\nMan of the match Hugo Lloris (Tottenham)"}, {"date": "26/12/2014", "arena": "Old Trafford", "attendance": 75318, "home_team": {"name": "Manchester United", "lineup": [{"name": "David De Gea", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Jones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paddy McNair", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonny Evans", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Carrick", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [62]}, {"name": "Antonio Valencia", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [80]}, {"name": "Juan Mata", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wayne Rooney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [23, 36], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Young", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robin van Persie", "yellows": [66], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [53], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Falcao", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [65]}], "subs": [{"name": "Rafael", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [80], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Smalling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Anders Lindegaard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Darren Fletcher", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [62], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tyler Blackett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andreas Pereira", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Wilson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [65], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Newcastle United", "lineup": [{"name": "Jak Alnwick", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daryl Janmaat", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Taylor", "yellows": [61], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fabricio Coloccini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paul Dummett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [63]}, {"name": "Vurnon Anita", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Colback", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yoan Gouffran", "yellows": [89], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Moussa Sissoko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Armstrong", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [63]}, {"name": "Ayoze Pérez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [82]}], "subs": [{"name": "Mike Williamson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Papiss Cisse", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [87], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [63], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rémy Cabella", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [63], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Haris Vuckic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [82], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Emmanuel Riviere", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lubomir Satka", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Freddie Woodman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Slowly but surely, the new-look Manchester United are beginning to click. There are still imperfections and Louis van Gaal was exaggerating a touch when he said they had dominated the entire match but at least they have rediscovered a winning habit and their old commitment to attacking, incisive football. They are playing with a new measure of confidence when they go forward and, after the stodginess of the David Moyes era, that at least is a start.\n\nThe gulf to the top two is considerable but the personnel are still formidable when Wayne Rooney and Juan Mata can be found lurking behind Robin van Persie and Radamel Falcao. Rooney scored twice, with a couple of Paul Scholes-like runs into the penalty area, as well as creating the headed third for Van Persie with a beautifully measured 40-yard ball towards the far post.\n\nFalcao, looking fitter than for some time, brilliantly laid on the first goal and his part in the second should not be overlooked either, sliding in to win the tackle that initiated the attack from which Mata played the pass and Rooney supplied the finish. Mata was also involved in the slick exchange that took the home side from one end of the pitch to the other to open the scoring and when this quartet are hitting these notes it can make up for the deficiencies elsewhere in the team.\n\nThe win still came attached with a slice of controversy and Mata will certainly be relieved that the referee, Mike Jones, gave him the benefit of the doubt after that early moment when he chased Yoan Gouffran back into the penalty area and clipped his opponent’s heels. Accidental or not, he had brought down his man and a penalty for Newcastle at that stage would have given the game a much different slant.\n\nRooney’s first goal arrived nine minutes later and, in between, there was the latest addition to David de Gea’s portfolio of outstanding saves, turning away a long-range effort from Daryl Janmaat that was soaring towards the top corner. For all the acclaim that will settle on Van Gaal’s front players, those moments were crucial.\n\nNewcastle had begun as though encouraged by what happened last season when they won here for the first time since February 1972, and eager to shake the home defeat to Sunderland out of their system. Alan Pardew had experimented with a new wing-back formation, designed to go like-for-like with the home side, and there were brief flashes to demonstrate why Adam Armstrong, their 17-year-old striker, has been creating such a buzz in the North-east.\n\nArmstrong had been chosen ahead of Papiss Cissé and was lively, if isolated, as the most advanced player in a team who probably should have been more emboldened to find the flaws in the opposition defence. Had they done so, they might have discovered more of the vulnerabilities that led to Phil Jones flicking out his left leg at Jack Colback to concede a needless penalty three minutes from the end. Pardew, reflecting on the earlier penalty claim, questioned mischievously whether the referee had given it “out of guilt”.\n\nInstead, it was Van Gaal’s team, now with 22 points out of a possible 24, who attacked with a real goal threat. Falcao had one of his more productive days and it was clear why Van Gaal removed Michael Carrick just after the hour, with a trip to Tottenham Hotspur to follow on Sunday. Carrick’s return from injury has been instrumental to the team’s recovery and the news before kick-off that Ángel di María has broken down with a pelvic problem was another reminder about the club’s run on that front. To date, there have been 49 reported injuries afflicting Van Gaal’s squad, involving 24 first-team players. “A little bit amazing,” the manager said.\n\nCissé had replaced Armstrong midway through the second half and expertly tucked away Newcastle’s penalty but by that stage the game was meandering towards its close and Van Gaal’s calculated gamble to restore Paddy McNair to his three-man defence – the 19-year-old’s first start since being substituted before half-time at Southampton – was ultimately a wise one.\n\nRooney had started the move for the first goal inside his own half, after Armstrong’s shot had come back off Carrick, and continued his run all the way into the penalty area. Falcao was almost at full length when he reached Mata’s cross but had the presence of mind to hook the ball across the six-yard box to pick out his team-mate. Rooney, from that position, would have been discourteous not to score.\n\nRooney has a long history of scoring against Newcastle and his second was another smart finish, this time traced back to Gouffran’s poor ball to Ayoze Pérez in a position that immediately left the visitors looking vulnerable.\n\nPérez was surrounded and what happened next epitomised the return to old values at Old Trafford. When a player of Falcao’s gifts is diving into tackles and coming out with the ball it feels like a sure sign that a team of fallen champions are back on an upward trajectory.\n\nMan of the match

terrible start it would have been very easy for us to capitulate,” said Bruce. “But instead the best team won at a canter, it was total domination from us in the second half.”\n\nThings began deceptively well for a Sunderland side who negated last Sunday’s major stride forward at Newcastle by taking two sizeable steps back towards a potential relegation struggle.\n\nAfter scoring the 90th minute winner in the Tyne-Wear derby, Adam Johnson delighted in giving Gus Poyet’s team a first-minute lead. Only 30 seconds had passed when the winger intercepted Curtis Davies’s shockingly slapdash backpass before slipping an angled, close range, shot beyond the appalled goalkeeper Allan McGregor.\n\nIf confirmation were needed that travelling fans had bigger things to worry about than the club cheekily changing its official Facebook page to Hull Tigers it seemed to have arrived.Across in the technical area, Bruce briefly covered his face with his hands. Memories of his painful exit here in November 2011 must have come flooding back as he was treated to a selection of “Geordie Bastard” jibes from a less than adoring former public.\n\nA net spend of around £40m during 2014 has recently been used a stick to beat him with at the KC Stadium but the Hull manager’s decision to take Gastón Ramírez on loan from Southampton may be finally paying dividends.\n\nRamírez’s equaliser altered the afternoon’s complexion beyond recognition. After collecting David Meyler’s pass and dodging John O’Shea the Uruguayan curled a left foot shot beyond Costel Pantilimon from outside the area.\n\nPantilimon – who got down to block but watched in horror as the ball bounced over him – looked furious and his ill temper spread to his team-mates as Sunderland saw two handball penalty appeals against Alex Bruce and Stephen Quinn rejected. “I think the referee showed common sense,” said Bruce senior.\n\nPerhaps distracted by their collective sense of grievance, Poyet’s players were caught cold when, early in the second half, Ramírez justified another chunk of his loan fee by delivering a deft near-post corner which James Chester headed, gratefully, past Pantilimon.\n\nAs Sunderland’s frustration manifested itself in a series of niggly fouls – typified by Steven Fletcher’s yellow card for a centre-circle challenge on Quinn – Hull, rather startlingly, morphed into a slick passing machine.\n\nAware his side were struggling to retain possession, Poyet replaced Jordi Gómez and Ricardo Álvarez with Emmanuele Giaccherini and Jozy Altidore. Back after a lengthy, injury induced, lay off Giaccherini showed off some lovely touches but it was not to be his day.\n\nInstead a visiting substitute, Nikica Jelavic, enjoyed the last word, dropping a shoulder before watching his shot elude Pantilimon. “A strange game, very disappointing after the derby,” said Poyet, torn between blaming the referee and his own players. “We’ve a few issues at the moment, a few problems, especially at the back, but there are no excuses.”\n\nSunderland (4-1-4-1): Pantilimon; Vergini (sub Buckley 83), Coates, O’Shea, Jones; Cattermole; Álvarez (sub Altidore 61),

such a class act when it comes to the art of taking free-kicks ended with Lukasz Fabianski, another of Swansea City’s excellent summer signings, enhancing his status as one of the best goalkeepers in the Premier League.\n\nWith Aston Villa pressing for the equaliser they deserved, Fabianski produced an outstanding one-handed save to repel Christian Benteke’s far-post header in injury time. Both sets of supporters were still catching their breath when opportunity knocked for Gabriel Agbonlahor, only for Fabianski instinctively to stick out a boot.\n\nIt was that sort of game for Villa who had the majority of possession (57%), 14 attempts on goal to Swansea’s nine, but once again failed to score. As much as Paul Lambert’s new philosophy has made them easier on the eye, the absence of a goal threat continues to handicap them. Villa have scored only 11 times in 18 league games this season.\n\n“We’re proud of [the players] for the way we played,” the Villa manager said. “We probably did to Swansea what they do to most teams coming here. I thought we outpassed them and hemmed them in. I go away from here disappointed to lose but delighted with the way we’re playing at the minute.”\n\nSwansea had no reason to feel guilty about hanging on for three points. A couple of weeks ago they were on the receiving end of an injustice here when Tottenham Hotspur pilfered a late winner. Back-to-back 1-0 victories have softened that blow and lifted the Welsh club to within four points of Southampton in fourth place. Garry Monk, who felt that Swansea “created enough chances to get that second goal and make it more comfortable”, refused to get carried away with the performance of Fabianski, who has kept eight clean sheets in the league.\n\n“It was a good save [from Benteke] at the end but that’s his job,” the Swansea manager said. “I don’t think he had too much to do throughout the game but at that critical moment right at the end, that’s what you need him for, so the concentration level shows what a good professional he is.”\n\nSigurdsson’s goal was out of keeping with the miserable conditions as rain lashed down from start to finish. Striking the ball with his right boot from 20 yards out and slightly to the left, the Icelander found the top corner. Brad Guzan, however, was covering that side of the goal. “I think Brad will probably be disappointed,” Lambert said.\n\nWithout Jefferson Montero, who limped off with a hamstring problem midway through the first half, Swansea no longer carried the same threat going forward. Villa got better and better as Lambert switched from 5-3-2 in the first half to 4-3-3 after the break. Andreas Weimann got in a couple of promising positions and failed to make the most of them before Ki Sung-yueng squandered a chance to double Swansea’s lead following a superb flick from Sigurdsson. Then Fabianski thwarted Benteke and Agbonlahor in the frantic finale.\n\nMan of the match Lukasz Fabianski (Swansea City)\n\nSwansea City (4-2-3-1) Fabianski; Rangel, Williams, Fernández, Taylor; Shelvey (Carroll, 60), Ki; Dyer, Sigurdsson (Emnes, 76), Montero (Routledge, 22); Bony.\n\nSubs not used Tremmel, Gomis, Bartley, Richards.\n\nBooked Shelvey\n\nAston Villa (5-3-2) Guzan; Hutton, Okore, Vlaar, Clark, Cissokho (Weimann, h-t); Delph, Sánchez, Cleverley (Grealish, 76); Agbonlahor, Benteke.\n\nSubs not used Given, Bacuna, Herd, N’Zogbia, Lowton.\n\nBooked Sánchez, Clark, Okore, Agbonlahor\n\nReferee R East.

in maintaining Manchester City’s imperious form in a critical week in the title contest than establishing a club record when Burnley visit the Etihad Stadium on Sunday.\n\nCity equalled a club record established more than a century ago with a ninth successive victory to remain within three points of Chelsea at the top of the Premier League. They scored freely in the first half, when Fernando, Yaya Touré and David Silva put Pellegrini’s side in complete control, before a second-half blizzard coated the Hawthorns pitch in snow and made City’s players more concerned with keeping their feet.\n\nCity have previously won nine games in succession on three occasions, most recently in 2011-12 under Roberto Mancini and also in 1909-10 and from April to September 1912.\n\nPellegrini’s priorities lie more with the here and now than in history. “No, I’m not worried about records,” the City manager said. “We are worried about adding the points because it will be a very close challenge for the title. I have watched some games that Burnley play and they have good players. If you think it is an easy game, you can have problems.”\n\nChelsea’s lunchtime win at West Ham United meant they maintained their advantage at the top of the table. “We’re not thinking about Chelsea at the moment,” Pellegrini said. “We are thinking about the game with Burnley. There are 20 more games to play for the title. And the race for the title is not just two teams, I think others will be involved also. How many other teams? I don’t know. [Manchester] United, see if they keep winning, and other teams who can arrive at 86 points can win the title.\n\n“I think this is a very important month and a key week because we play nine points in one week. It’s important if we can get to the top as soon as possible.”\n\nThis seventh consecutive league victory keeps City right on the coattails of Chelsea, before contrasting fixtures when the leaders travel to recovering Southampton and Tottenham Hotspur. After Burnley, City play Sunderland at home on New Year’s Day. It appears a pivotal week.\n\nAs Albion floundered around seeking consolation, Alan Irvine could claim that at least his side did not go under in the second half, but a sixth defeat in eight games leaves them two points above the relegation zone as they prepare to visit Stoke City on Sunday.\n\nThe West Bromwich manager, who watched Brown Ideye score his first league goal for the club after Joe Hart missed a punch from Chris Brunt’s corner with three minutes left, sounded less convinced of his own future than ever after only six months in charge. “The chairman will make a decision about that,” Irvine said. “I don’t know what the thinking is. All I can do is work as hard as I can and try to make sure we keep giving the right sorts of performances.”\n\nAlbion desperately needed a win to restore confidence after their 3-2 defeat at While the referee, Mark Clattenburg, never appeared to consult with his fellow officials over whether the match should be completed, the ball did not roll as normal and City’s players seemed to be avoiding going into unnecessary tackles as they refrained from chasing a goal avalanche in the second half.\n\nQueens Park Rangers where they had surrendered a 2-0 lead but their slim hopes of beating the champions were snuffed out in the first 34 minutes.\n\nEven with no striker on the field, City had far too much firepower for their opponents. If anything, having James Milner playing as the most advanced of six midfielders meant City’s tempo and movement was better than ever. “James is a very intelligent player,” Pellegrini said. “He knows what movement he must make to create space for the others.”\n\nWithin eight minutes City were ahead and Ben Foster was at fault. Jesús Navas played a one-two with Touré down the right and from his awkward cross the England squad goalkeeper fumbled the ball inside his six-yard area from where Fernando scored with an overhead kick as dextrous as it was surprising. It was only the Brazilian’s second shot on target in the Premier League.\n\nFive minutes later Joleon Lescott, the former City defender, got some of the ball as he tackled Silva but Clattenburg had no hesitation in awarding a penalty. From the spot Touré scored his sixth goal in nine games in all competitions.\n\nAlbion were wholly lacking in conviction at this point. Even though they had been the better team at Loftus Road, and beaten Aston Villa 1-0 in their previous game at the Hawthorns, not even the return of Saido Berahino increased their belief. Indeed, it was their leading goalscorer who screwed his shots wide, twice, when fed by through balls from James Morrison, either side of City’s third goal.\n\nAfter 34 minutes, Fernando was allowed to run clear from halfway to the edge of the Albion area where he switched the ball wide to Navas, who fed it back to Silva to side-foot home. Foster, presumably unsighted, barely moved.\n\nIn the second half the yellow ball came into its own as the pitch turned white under the incessant snow, and the match resembled a sideshow to the conditions. For Albion, Silvestre Varela side-footed a half-volley wide from Andre Wisdom’s cross to the far post, and Lescott headed over, before Ideye’s goal, after City had dominated possession easily when no one went out of their way to risk falling over too much.\n\nMan of the match James Milner (Manchester City).\n\nWest Bromwich Albion 4-1-2-3 Foster; Wisdom, McAuley, Lescott, Pocognoli (Gamboa, 66); Morrison; Mulumbu, Gardner (Brunt, 66); Varela (Ideye, 67), Sessègnon, Berahino.

But here was proof that, although Arsène Wenger’s men retain the capacity to infuriate, there is heart to go with all that talent, an ability for the prettiest of teams to win ugly.\n\nThey were hanging on by the end, reduced to 10 men by Olivier Giroud’s needless sending-off on 53 minutes. Queens Park Rangers, having got back into the contest through Charlie Austin’s late penalty, sensed they could secure the most improbable of comebacks having found themselves 2-0 down through goals from Alexis Sánchez and Tomas Rosicky either side of half-time.\n\nThe home supporters were tense, the memory of how Arsenal had capitulated at Anfield last week fresh in their minds, but this time their side held on, seeing off a barrage of attacks from the visitors with stout, resolute defending. It was rather unArsenal-like and, for that reason, wholly encouraging for them before testing games against West Ham and Southampton in the coming days.\n\nFor Wenger this was a 400th Premier League victory as Arsenal manager and, as he conceded afterwards, it proved tougher than the first. Yet he was also right in saying Arsenal deserved the win, one which sees them move to within one place and one point of West Ham before their visit to Upton Park on Sunday.\n\n“We made it hard work for ourselves but we were in control, even with 10 men,” said the Frenchman. “The last five or six minutes were edgy because we let in a late goal last week [against Liverpool]; that was probably in our mind. But in the end we showed resilience and great spirit.”\n\nThis was a ninth straight away league defeat for QPR and, although their manager, Harry Redknapp, could reflect on a strong claim for a second penalty for his side when Bobby Zamora appeared to be hauled down by Kieran Gibbs in those frantic final stages, he accepted his side, toothless in attack for the majority of this contest, deserved little from it. “This was a good opportunity to take a point against 10 men and we didn’t take it,” he said.\n\nRedknapp’s mood was darkened by the “atrocious defending” his team displayed in the build-up to Arsenal’s first goal on 37 minutes. There were six QPR players in their own penalty area when Gibbs whipped in a left-wing cross after good approach play from Rosicky, Danny Welbeck and Santi Cazorla, yet none of them managed to spot Sánchez lurking near the far post. Unmarked, the Chilean headed past Rob Green and, in an instant, made up for his penalty miss in the early stages of the match.\n\nThe Chilean won the spot-kick after being hacked down inside the area by the former Arsenal full-back Armand Traoré and then gently but surely nudging Cazorla, the home team’s designated taker, out of contention. It proved an error on Sánchez’s part because his subsequent shot lacked pace and positioning, allowing Green to block the ball before pushing it away for a corner.\n\nThat was the last bad move Sánchez made on an evening when the 26-year-old again proved Arsenal made a more than wise decision spending £35m on his talents in the summer. The forward was a blur of power and surging sprints from the right of the home team’s attack, running QPR ragged from the outset and no one more so than Traoré, who was substituted on 62 minutes partly for his own good.\n\nSánchez set the tone for what was an aggressive and quick-tempoed display from Arsenal with Cazorla and Mathieu Flamini also impressing with their desire to put QPR to the sword. It took longer than it should have but Arsenal’s breakthrough was more than deserved.\n\nSánchez’s goal, his 15th of the season, should have been the cue for the hosts to run riot but then Giroud lost his head. Infuriated by a push from Nedum Onuoha as he attempted to charge down Green’s clearance, the Frenchman butted the defender. Onuoha went down easily but there were no complaints when the referee, Martin Atkinson, drew his red card. Giroud, not long back from a broken leg, now misses a busy and potentially crucial period for Arsenal. Little wonder Wenger gave the striker a thunderous glare as he left the field.\n\nHaving been camped in their own half and unable to keep possession long enough to build attacking momentum, QPR suddenly sensed an opportunity to make amends. But, as Redknapp said, they failed to take their chance and instead it was Arsenal who scored. Not surprisingly Sánchez was involved, carrying the ball forward before setting up Rosicky in his first appearance for the hosts since recovering from a thigh injury.\n\nThat, yet again, appeared to be that but then Mathieu Debuchy was harshly adjudged to have tripped Junior Hoilett inside the area and Austin stepped up to smash in his 12th goal of the season. QPR piled on the pressure, with Mauricio Isla forcing Flamini to block in front of the goalline and Zamora going down under pressure from Gibbs. It was fraught and frantic but Arsenal survived and deservedly so.\n\nMan of the match Alexis Sánchez (Arsenal)"}, {"date": "22/12/2014", "arena": "Bet365 Stadium", "attendance": 27550, "home_team": {"name": "Stoke City", "lineup": [{"name": "Asmir Begovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Bardsley", "yellows": [20], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Shawcross", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marc Muniesa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Erik Pieters", "yellows": [53], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven N'Zonzi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Geoff Cameron", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [68]}, {"name": "Jon Walters", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bojan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marko Arnautovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [82]}, {"name": "Peter Crouch", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [63]}], "subs": [{"name": "Robert Huth", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Glenn Whelan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marc Wilson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charlie Adam", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [68], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mame Biram Diouf", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [63], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Butland", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Oussama Assaidi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [82], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Chelsea", "lineup": [{"name": "Thibaut Courtois", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Branislav Ivanovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gary Cahill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Terry", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [2], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "César Azpilicueta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Mikel Obi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nemanja Matic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willian", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [80]}, {"name": "Cesc Fàbregas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [78], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eden Hazard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Diego Costa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [85]}], "subs": [{"name": "Petr Cech", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Filipe Luis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kurt Zouma", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathan Aké", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Oscar", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Didier Drogba", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [85], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "André Schürrle", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [80], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "The portents are promising for Chelsea and ominous for their rivals. This is the fourth time that Chelsea have enjoyed the view from the top of the Premier League come Christmas Day and on each of the previous occasions they have gone on to win the title. John Terry’s header after only 95 seconds, followed by a second-half goal from Cesc Fàbregas, secured their place at the summit and restored their three-point advantage over Manchester City.\n\nIt was, in short, a much happier experience for José Mourinho than 12 months ago when his Chelsea side were beaten 3-2 here and the Portuguese departed bemoaning their failure to “kill the game”. Fàbregas’ corner had set up Terry’s opener to take his tally of assists for the season to 12 – Thierry Henry’s Premier League record of 20 in a single campaign looks to be under serious threat – and the Spaniard ensured there would be no slip-up this time when his mishit shot found its way into the bottom corner.\n\nThe performance, as well as the result, reinforced the impression that Chelsea possess all the qualities to stay the course. Diego Costa could afford to have an off night on an evening when Fàbregas showed some lovely touches in midfield, Eden Hazard stood up to Phil Bardsley’s early attempts to rough him up and Nemanja Matic was the outstanding player on the pitch.\n\nTerry was not getting carried away when he described Matic as a “revelation” this season.\n\nIt was hard not to contrast Chelsea’s commanding display with the way Arsenal imploded here this month. With Matic a formidable presence in front of the resolute central-defensive partnership of Terry and Gary Cahill, Stoke were restricted to few goalscoring opportunities while at the other end of the pitch Chelsea looked threatening whenever they attacked. For Mourinho, it was a highly satisfactory night’s work.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest José Mourinho says Chelsea’s win against Stoke City meant more than just three points\n\n“It’s a victory that means a bit more than the three points, not just because it’s difficult but also because to win here you need to put more than just your quality,” he said. “The players were a team, they worked together and coped well with a difficult style.”\n\nThe Chelsea manager was full of praise for Terry, who has now scored in each of the past 15 Premier League seasons. “More important than the goal for me is the way he’s playing this season,” Mourinho said. “When I came here last season he was a bit in trouble, his career was a bit up and down, not playing regular for Chelsea. Certainly in the last two years he’s playing basically every game and for me at the same level he was playing in 2004-07 when I was here. I think he knows the way I trust him, I think he feels very confident, very happy and he’s playing very well.”\n\nThat goal, when Terry got ahead of Geoff Cameron to dispatch Fàbregas’s corner, got Chelsea off to the perfect start. Stoke looked rather flat in the early stages and it was not until after Bardsley clattered into Hazard on the touchline, earning a yellow card that could easily have been red, that the home team roused.\n\nMourinho was furious with Bardsley’s challenge at the time and became embroiled in an angry exchange with the Stoke manager Mark Hughes, but he was much more restrained when he spoke afterwards.\n\n“From my position, and in a flash, it looks a red card,” Mourinho said. “But I don’t know. What I know is that if it was a bad tackle it was the only one. The game was clean, good and aggressive. The referee kept the game under control and the players were fair.”\n\nStoke enjoyed their best period of the game around the midway point of the second half, when they started to apply a little pressure and Charlie Adam’s raking drive drifted inches wide, but Chelsea’s second goal of the evening extinguished any hopes that Hughes had of salvaging a point.\n\nHazard, who had sportingly kicked the ball out of play when Bardsley was down injured not long after the Stoke right-back had put him into touch – “I wouldn’t do it for a guy who kicked me,” Mourinho said, smiling – picked out Fàbregas in the Stoke penalty area.\n\nThe Spaniard’s first touch was heavy and his shot was anything but convincing, but it bobbled past Asmir Begovic and into the net. Costa then squandered his second one-on-one of the evening.

Johnson’s 90th-minute goal ensured his side won their fourth successive game against Newcastle and Gus Poyet his fifth in five managerial duels with them.\n\nPoyet’s infliction of this latest embarrassment was partly due to a man-of-the-match performance from Sebastian Larsson, whose intelligence in central midfield played a big part in wrecking the home team’s game plan.\n\nAs the clocked ticked down and Larsson slowed the tempo, Pardew’s desperation to outwit his nemesis resulted in Newcastle’s manager throwing every available striker on to the pitch. This gung-ho policy nearly paid off but also left the home side horribly vulnerable to counterattacks.\n\nSunderland had begun on the back foot when Anthony Réveillère, Poyet’s only fit left-back, aggravated a calf injury in the warm-up. With John O’Shea relocated to the left, Sebastián Coates stepped in at centre-half. Initially both defenders struggled as Newcastle poured forward and Sunderland struggled to escape their own half, let alone develop the passing fluency Poyet preaches.\n\nOn a rare occasion when they broke, Steven Fletcher endured the agony of a sneaky knee in the lower back from Fabricio Coloccini. A little lucky not to be sent off, the Argentinian was booked while Poyet’s anger was exacerbated by Fletcher’s history of back trouble.\n\nThe Sunderland manager’s mood was hardly improved when Cheik Tioté committed five unpunished fouls before finally seeing yellow at the sixth attempt. Tioté’s indiscipline helped Sunderland not only establish a foothold in the game but create the better chances on an afternoon when, despite playing well in patches, Newcastle forced Costel Pantilimon into only a handful of significant saves.\n\nTwo came from Moussa Sissoko shots and another from the lively Ayoze Pérez but neither was quite as dangerous as the moment when Fletcher met Larsson’s first-time through-pass on the volley and the ball brushed the bar.\n\nWith a Connor Wickham shot subsequently being touched on to a post by Jak Alnwick and a header from the same player later bringing the best out of Pardew’s third-choice goalkeeper, Sunderland were proving unexpectedly dangerous.\n\nAlmost imperceptibly Lee Cattermole began subduing the initially imperious Sissoko, Larsson’s passing range clicked into groove and Wickham menaced when drifting in from the left.\n\nIf Wickham’s booking for clattering Alnwick was less impressive, happily the mood in the stands proved slightly more civilised. When the electronic clock signalled 17 minutes, away fans joined home supporters’ now traditional 60 seconds applause in tribute to John Alder and Liam Sweeney who had been on their way to New Zealand to watch Newcastle’s summer tour when flight MH17 was shot down over Ukraine.\n\nSunderland’s supporters raised £33,000 towards initiatives in the pair’s memory and, in the 33rd minute, their rivals thanked them courtesy of another round of clapping.\n\nIn case anybody thought things were becoming too friendly it was immediately followed by a robust reminder that not quite everything had changed. “We hate Sunderland,” came the chant but, somehow, it lacked the venom of previous years.\n\nEven so the Gallowgate End were mightily relieved when, with Steven Taylor off the pitch having a facial wound stitched, Jordi Gómez spurned a golden opportunity. If that miss served to galvanise Newcastle, a trio of home substitutions arguably set the scene for Johnson’s dramatic denouement. Clearly deciding fortune favours the brave, Pardew introduced three attacking players in Adam Armstrong, Papiss Cissé and Rémy Cabella.\n\nArmstrong showed some excellent movement but the resultant gaps at the back enabled Johnson to miss a glorious chance before making amends seconds after Pantilimon tipped Sissoko’s 30-yard shot on to the bar.\n\nAppropriately Johnson started and finished the decisive move, running half the length of the pitch before Fletcher and then Will Buckley took up the baton. By the time Buckley laid the ball off, the winger had arrived in the area at precisely the right moment to lash the finishing touch beyond Alnwick.\n\nJudging by the look on Pardew’s face he might as well have driven a stake through his heart.\n\nMan of the match Sebastian Larsson (Sunderland)"}, {"date": "21/12/2014", "arena": "Anfield", "attendance": 44703, "home_team": {"name": "Liverpool",

Arsenal came courtesy of a scar on the head.\n\nMartin Skrtel, bandaged and bloodied from a nasty cut to the cranium, scored a towering header in time added-on for his earlier treatment to earn Brendan Rodgers’ 10 men a merited reprieve. Some scars heal quicker than others.\n\nArsenal played with the handbrake on, according to their manager, who also believed his team were burdened by the psychological baggage of February’s 5-1 humiliation on this ground.\n\nLiverpool played with the intensity that had been the hallmark of Rodgers’ teams until this season’s rapid reverse, dominated possession and chances created, and refused to go quietly even after Fabio Borini’s late dismissal for two bookable offences. But the points and poor defending at set-pieces were not all the teams shared. The pair continue to find momentum elusive or convince that they can be anything more than dots in the rear-view mirrors of Chelsea and Manchester City.\n\nWenger’s team were less than three minutes away from healing some of the wounds of 10 months ago and enabling their manager to walk through a train station without fear of confrontation with angry supporters. The result would have been more impressive than their performance, but even that proved beyond them when the conspicuous Skrtel was left unmarked in the area and headed home Adam Lallana’s corner in the 97th minute.\n\nGoals from Mathieu Debuchy and Olivier Giroud, whose boot accidentally cut Skrtel’s head – leading to nine minutes of injury time – were two of Arsenal’s seven attempts on goal. Liverpool had 27, 10 on target. Rodgers’ men also had 65% possession compared to Arsenal’s 35%, their lowest percentage since the statistics began to be recorded in 2003.\n\nThe Liverpool manager claimed this was a superior performance to the one that holed Arsenal’s title credentials and affirmed their own in February. That was some exaggeration although, given the predicament Liverpool have found themselves in, any tentative step forward has to be embraced.\n\nA draw ultimately frustrated Arsenal but that they walked off level at the interval was a source of astonishment, even among their delighted travelling contingent. Liverpool dominated from the start, enjoying 79% possession after 17 minutes, but for all of Raheem Sterling’s tireless endeavour at the head of the attack there was a lack of penetration until Philippe Coutinho struck with half-time beckoning. At least Rodgers’ team carried intent. An Arsenal side containing five forwards indicated similar adventure but the reality was imbalance and poor-quality supply to their isolated attack until improvement arrived in the second half.\n\nWith Wenger’s options limited by injury and that 5-1, the visitors sought to contain Liverpool in the first half even though only one of their central-midfield trio, Mathieu Flamini, was naturally suited to the task. Flamini received an early booking for a challenge from behind on the influential Coutinho and the benefit of the doubt from the referee Michael Oliver when he caught Lallana in the face with an elbow in the 43rd minute. Anfield bayed for a second yellow card that was not forthcoming but the controversy stirred a previously subdued contest to life.\n\nFor all of their first-half control Liverpool’s chances were restricted to a Lallana snap-shot that flew over, a Lazar Markovic effort that Wojciech Szczesny saved with his legs and a first-time curler from the Serb that sailed high over the Arsenal crossbar. Two minutes after Flamini’s reprieve, however, the home side took a deserved lead when Giroud carelessly conceded possession deep inside his own half. Jordan Henderson pounced on the striker’s poor touch and found Coutinho, who side-stepped Debuchy before beating Szczesny with a fine low finish off the inside of the far post.\n\nLiverpool should have seen the half out comfortably given their hold on the game and Arsenal’s non-existent threat. Instead they handed momentum back to their opponents a minute later.\n\nFrom an Alexis Sánchez free-kick, conceded by Steven Gerrard with a foul on the Chile international, Per Mertesacker won the first header, Flamini the second and Debuchy the third to score beyond Brad Jones via a deflection off the back of Skrtel’s as-yet-undamaged head. Liverpool’s persistent vulnerability at set pieces was graphically underlined.\n\nLevel, despite contributing little in the final third, the visitors made the most of Liverpool’s carelessness after the interval with a more incisive display. Shortly after injuring Skrtel, Giroud hurt Liverpool defenders again with the second goal. Kieran Gibbs intercepted a Gerrard pass and sprinted down the left before finding Giroud lurking outside the Liverpool area. The striker released Santi Cazorla to the byline, the Spaniard returned an inviting pass and Giroud converted through Jones’ legs from close range.\n\nLucas Leiva, Coutinho, Gerrard and Borini all went close to an equaliser for the home side and not even the dismissal of the Italian substitute, for a foul on Cazorla that warranted a second yellow card, disrupted Liverpool’s flow. Skrtel soared through the air to level and spread the pain to Arsenal.\n\nMan of the match Philippe Coutinho (Liverpool)"}, {"date": "20/12/2014", "arena": "Etihad Stadium", "attendance": 45302,

only the London club’s superior goal difference keeping them ahead in a championship race that is warming up nicely.\n\nOn 29 November Chelsea stood on 33 points and City 24 in what seemed a moment when the west London club might gallop off into the distance with this season’s crown, albeit that they had played a game more. Instead, as predicted by Manuel Pellegrini in that Cool Hand Luke managerial style of his, City have reeled in Chelsea, though Monday evening’s visit to Stoke City is a game in hand that could re-establish a three-point margin.\n\nAs with their campaign thus far, this was a contest the champions grew into and by the close, when James Milner raced upfield to set up Yaya Touré for his fifth strike in eight games – the finish pin-balling off the right post – City had a third and were coasting.\n\nBefore this James McArthur appeared to have a goal wrongly disallowed for offside, which if it had stood could have given City a nervy final few minutes. This left Neil Warnock furious and it is understood that after the game he asked for permission to talk to Phil Dowd, the referee inviting him into his office to discuss the decision.\n\n“It is two yards onside. It is a disgraceful decision,” the Crystal Palace manager said. “It is hard enough to score at the Etihad without goals being chalked off without a reason. I wish I was still working in the media so I could say what I want without getting fined. They have to get decisions like that right. My players deserve that. It is so disappointing.”\n\nWith no Sergio Agüero, Edin Dzeko or Stevan Jovetic, Pellegrini decided to fill the frontline striker void with Milner. Would he be a false No9 or would the City No7 be a traditional centre-forward? The answer seemed to be the latter, though as with all modern attacking players Milner drifted in and out of midfield pockets.\n\nAfterwards, Pellegrini indicated as much. “Milner made a very good performance, a sacrifice performance but he moves a lot to create the space for the midfielders. David [Silva] also arrives very well in the box, as did Yaya, that is the way we were working during the week to try to create the space for them to arrive in the second line.\n\n“We have been preparing this match all week and we plan all this movement for Milner to create the freedom for all the colleagues.”\n\nThe contest had a scrappy opening during which Palace saw as much of the ball as City. Yannick Bolasie was among the brighter visitors, the DR Congo forward’s pace along the left troubling the champions.\n\nCity’s class offers the impression that against an opponent of Palace’s ilk they can create chances at will. In Samir Nasri, the hero of the 2-0 Champions League triumph at Roma, Pellegrini has a player who has recently stepped up his game, adding a muscular presence to his dainty skills.\n\nTouré is another City man whose form is hitting a majestic vein. Twice the Ivorian produced sublime flicks, the second of which sand-wedged the ball into Aleksandar Kolarov for the left-back to cross.\n\nThe stereotypical Warnock side hit long balls into the area and hope to profit from a knockdown and, though Bolasie’s on-the-deck trickery belied this at times, a few hail marys were aimed at Hart’s goal. When Kolarov was booked for a foul on Jason Puncheon, Martin Kelly hoofed the ball from inside his half to near City’s six-yard box, Brede Hangeland headed on and Bolasie was on the end of it to go close to opening the scoring.\n\nThe instruction must have gone out from Pellegrini that the tempo should be heightened and that his team needed to be more ruthless in the second half. Nasri, Kolarov and Silva made pretty shapes near the left corner flag and the Frenchman went on a run that took him to the opposing flank before the move fizzled out.\n\nThen, finally, the match had a goal. It derived from the slow-slow-quick-quick stuff that has made City so successful. Touré pea-rolled the ball to Fernandinho who, after a glance ahead, zipped the ball in to Pablo Zabaleta and when the Argentinian reversed it to Silva he scored, via a deflection off Scott Dann.\n\nThe Spanish schemer’s third league goal this season was jubilantly received by Pellegrini and City fans. Now their side were level on points with Chelsea, and there was a platform on which to try to reduce or even catch their goal difference, still superior by three.\n\nSilva’s first arrived on 49 minutes. His second came just past the hour. This was a throwback of a move that involved a simple yet destructive Kolarov cross to Silva, whose instant shot allowed Julián Speroni little chance.\n\nNow it is over to the Britannia Stadium to see if Chelsea can beat Stoke and create some daylight at the top again."}, {"date": "20/12/2014", "arena": "Villa Park", "attendance": 41273, "home_team": {"name": "Aston Villa", "lineup": [{"name":

Too often their buildup play was slow and prosaic, in particular in the first half when United dominated possession but rarely penetrated.\n\nVan Gaal did not hesitate when asked whether it was the sort of result that United would look back on at the end of the season and wonder if it cost them the title. “Yes, that’s what I mean,” the United manager said.\n\n“I’ve seen, for example, Manchester City only in the first half against Crystal Palace and they could also be behind in the first five or 10 minutes and they struggle until half-time, but in the end it is 3-0. That’s the difference.\n\n“When you want to be part of the title race, you have to win these games. I think also that we were not so aggressive in the first half as we are usually, we kept the ball much better but we didn’t create so much because we were not looking to the forwards, that’s why I changed Darren Fletcher with Carrick because I know he’s more of a passer to the forwards. But it was not good enough to catch the victory here. We were not creative enough in the second half, we don’t keep the ball so good as in the first half but we had more aggression, so that was the plus.”\n\nFor Villa, the result was greeted with a mixture of pride and anger. A team severely depleted through injury and suspension – Paul Lambert said Villa’s bench was “like a kindergarten” – showed tremendous character against a club that tend to enjoy rich pickings in these parts. There was, however, a sense of injustice about Mason’s decision to send off Agbonlahor, after a 50-50 challenge with Young that seemed anything but malicious.\n\n“If that is a red card, you may as well pack up, because it won’t be a game of football,” Lambert said. “I spoke to Brad Guzan after the game and he said Ashley Young admitted that he fouled Gabby. I can understand Kieran Richardson getting sent off last week [against West Bromwich Albion] but there’s no way that’s a red card.\n\n“It’s a tackle where two lads went in for the ball. Gabby is really down, which you’d expect. But I’ll stick up for him all day long.”\n\nBenteke’s opening goal – his first at Villa Park in the league since March – came totally against the run of play, but it was an absolute beauty.\n\nTaking the ball down on his chest following Fabian Delph’s deep free-kick, Benteke shifted the ball onto his left foot and, with Jonny Evans standing off him, curled a sumptuous shot from just inside the penalty area that arched into the top corner. “A world class goal and it gave us something to hold onto,” Lambert said.\n\nBenteke was denied a second early in the second half, when David de Gea tipped over the Belgian’s header, and moments later United brought parity through Falcao following a fine piece of wing-play from Young. Showing tenacity and pace, Young beat Matthew Lowton on the outside before digging out a superb cross that implored the unmarked Falcao to head home.\n\nUnited huffed and puffed in pursuit of a winner as Carrick’s glancing header was hacked clear by Okore. James Wilson, a second-half substitute, forced the impressive Guzan into a late save, but Villa, who had a late chance of their own when Leandro Bacuna drilled inches wide, refused to buckle."},

gamble with the Swansea City side he took to Hull City and was delighted to be rewarded with a 1-0 victory.\n\nMonk surprisingly made seven changes for the trip to the KC Stadium, with his top scorer, Wilfried Bony, benched in favour of Bafétimbi Gomis while Gylfi Sigurdsson, Leon Britton and Jefferson Montero were all excused duty with minor fitness niggles.\n\nWith the crowded festive fixture list just starting, Monk made the tough call to provide key men with an early rest but still walked away with the points after Ki Sung-yueng inadvertently deflected Jonjo Shelvey’s shot goalwards.\n\n“I knew making those changes that people would question it but I was very confident in the group,” he said. “We have such a busy period coming up and if you play the same 11 players in that period that’s suicide for me.\n\n“We haven’t got the biggest squad but we have got quality. We have a way of working where everyone understands what their roles are so I had no problem putting different players in those positions. I trust them and I think that trust was shown in the game. Some of them haven’t had a hell of a lot of game time but all credit to them, they dug in and got the result which is what it’s all about.”\n\nWith Bony due to represent the Ivory Coast at January’s African Cup of Nations , Gomis’s elevation gave a hint of what Swansea fans can expect in January. He was one of three players to hit the post, joining Shelvey and Hull wing-back Andy Robertson, and pleased Monk with his contribution. “Obviously we’re coming up to a period where Bony will go to the African Cup of Nations and Bafi needs game time,” he added.\n\n“That was behind my decision and I thought Bafi did very well. He’s a very good striker and could have got a couple of goals. Those minutes will help him hit the ground running when January comes and Bony goes away.”\n\nFor the Tigers, things are becoming increasingly bleak. They are winless in 10 matches and have not scored in seven of those. Lying second from bottom they are also battling a player shortage, with Jake Livermore’s fifth yellow card ruling him out of the Boxing Day trip to Sunderland and the defenders Curtis Davies and Alex Bruce limping off. With Michael Dawson, Mohamed Diamé and Tom Huddlestone already missing, Bruce is without a handful of senior men.\n\n“Today just highlighted for me the need for your big players,” he said. “I still expect a better performance than we witnessed in the second half but we’re crying out for some of our bigger players. Whether it’s injuries or suspensions we couldn’t cope without them. You need your big established Premier League players and far too many of ours are sitting in the stands.”\n\nBruce also revealed that SOS calls for Tom Ince and Maynor Figueroa, on loan at Nottingham Forest and Wigan respectively, were imminent. “We’ll probably recall Incey and probably Figueroa too.

if – then history will perhaps record that the campaign to erect a vast bronze likeness of Charlie Austin on Shepherd’s Bush Green started here.\n\nAustin scored a finisher’s hat-trick against a neat but brittle West Bromwich Albion to make it eight in his last five home games as Rangers recovered from going 2-0 down in the opening 20 minutes to claim an improbable home win.\n\nAt the end of which Harry Redknapp’s non-travelling Hoops now have five Premier League victories at Loftus Road this season: Austin has scored at least once in each, four times claiming the winner. Here he ran and chased relentlessly and several times fell over his own feet. But he was brilliantly sharp whenever it mattered, scoring all three goals from corners, the winner coming in the 85th minute with a lovely leaping header from an inswinging Joey Barton delivery.\n\n“Everybody will talk about Charlie’s three goals, but his defending late in the game was fantastic,” Redknapp said later of a player who now has more goals this season than the rest of the QPR squad put together. “He made a tackle right by the corner flag. Anybody would have thought he was a right-back. That summed him up, his work rate was phenomenal.”\n\nBefore kick-off this match had the feeling of a slightly premature relegation pre-eliminator, a tribute to QPR’s determination to play like a team with one hand tied behind its back. So far this season Rangers have the home form of a top-six team and the away record of something that doesn’t really resemble a team at all, more a collection of disparate, slightly baffled individuals fulfilling the fixture list.\n\nAustin had missed the latest of these – the limp 3-1 defeat at Everton on Monday – through suspension. Here he returned to partner Bobby Zamora up front, with Eduardo Vargas pushed high up on the right and the expectation of another storming home start.\n\nThis time, though, Rangers ran cold as West Brom’s short-passing midfield dominated possession. With seven minutes gone Brown Ideye clumped Stéphane Sessègnon’s cut-back into the second tier of the stand from six yards out (no mean feat in itself). But the goal was coming, and after 10 minutes it duly arrived, Joleon Lescott heading in Sessègnon’s flick-on from Sébastien Pocognoli’s corner. The challenge from Rangers’ central defenders was flaccid, in keeping with a poor start that saw the home team repeatedly give the ball away and a flat midfield offer little drive or invention.\n\nWest Brom continued to pass and move with greater purpose, and with 20 minutes gone it was 2-0. Silvestre Varela poked home his first Premier League goal at the end of a run from halfway, a simple exchange of passes with Sessègnon enough to bamboozle a Rangers defence in which Richard Dunne twice lost his man, turning and twisting with all the gossamer grace of a fully laden municipal dustcart.\n\nQPR showed spirit to hit back almost immediately. James Morrison pulled back Leroy Fer at a corner as the Rangers man went to poke a loose ball goalwards, a good spot through a crowd of players by the referee Craig Pawson. Austin blasted the penalty kick past Ben Foster.\n\nAt the start of the second half the drive finally came from Rangers. A series of long punts forward, a bullocking run from Nedum Onuoha down the right, and West Brom were rocking. Dunne headed a right-wing corner against the bar, Bobby Zamora nodded it back and Austin – of course – finished.\n\nRangers, for all their lumpen first half, were level at 2-2.\n\nWest Brom settled again, taking possession for periods without creating clear chances, but looking vulnerable whenever Rangers did press. In a fevered, error-strewn last 10 minutes Austin’s moment finally came, as it always seemed likely to.\n\nFor Alan Irvine there was simply disappointment. West Brom played the better, more coherent football, but suffered from a lack of concentrated cutting edge. None of the starting front six here have more than a single goal this season, albeit there were encouraging signs that the swift and skilful Varela and (more dimly) the hesitant Ideye may be starting to settle.\n\n“We were the better team,” Irvine said, correctly. “We created most of the chances, we controlled it for long periods, but unfortunately we just didn’t defend well enough at three corners.”"}, {"date": "20/12/2014", "arena": " Mary's Stadium", "attendance": 31475, "home_team": {"name": "Southampton", "lineup": [{"name": "Fraser Forster", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals":

Roberto Martínez’s team have managed consecutive league victories only once this season and such unpredictability is becoming a worry, no matter how much emphasis the manager is placing on the Europa League. “We were a little bit soft and got done by three goals around the six-yard box,” the Everton manager said. “We haven’t been involved in a good run of form like last season, but it is part of the learning curve. We want to be a team involved in Europe and I will never complain about having too many games.”\n\nThere was a boldness in the way Koeman set his side up but it reaped handsome rewards. A midfield ravaged by injury and suspension meant a debut for the 19-year-old Harrison Reed and a switch to three centre-halves. Reed acquitted himself well from the start and, despite ceding a larger share of possession, it was Southampton who always appeared the more likely to score despite failing to register a shot on target until Graziano Pellè made it 2-0 in the 65th minute.\n\n“We had unbelievable spirit today,” Koeman said. “It’s always important if you change the system that the players feel comfortable. We had good organisation and the key to the win was winning the battles in midfield – Reed was outstanding and showed a lot of energy.”\n\nTheir opening opportunity to get at Everton arrived eight minutes in when Shane Long skipped past Sylvain Distin and appeared to be clean through before Distin recovered, challenged at the edge of the area and sent the Irishman tumbling. The referee Jonathan Moss waved play on to the disgust of the home support but a sense of injustice invigorated Southampton and within two minutes they should have been in front when Nathaniel Clyne’s cross from the right was met by Pellè, only for his free header to drift over.\n\nEverton huffed and puffed without causing the Southampton defence much trouble. They neatly spread the ball around midfield but there was a desperate lack of thrust and they produced little apart from a succession of corners midway through the half. Instead the Pellè and Long combination continued to cause problems and the former had a goal ruled out on the half-hour after Long fouled Phil Jagielka in the buildup.\n\nThe home fans were further incensed by Moss in the lead-up to the opening goal when Southampton were refused a blatant penalty after Jagielka kicked Long in mid-air. Instead, a corner was awarded to the disbelief of almost everyone as Jagielka failed to make contact with the ball and from the ensuing kick Jack Ward-Prowse’s delivery was met by Romelu Lukaku, who turned it into his own net under pressure from José Fonte. “I am open to the debate over it being a penalty but it is not a corner,” Martínez added.\n\nEverton continued to disappoint in the final third and Samuel Eto’o struck fresh air when in a promising position 12 minutes into the second half. “We controlled the game, they didn’t create a lot,” Koeman said. Southampton, in turn, broke menacingly and the relief was notable when they doubled their advantage. Clyne’s cross from the right was knocked down by Long and Pellè was on hand to dab past Tim Howard with his left boot.\n\nIn response, a thumping effort from Lukaku was well saved by Fraser Forster 13 minutes from time before Maya Yoshida rounded things off with an unorthodox finish, shouldering in Steven Davis’s cross from the left. Koeman raised his hands in delight; an exasperated Martínez must have wanted to bury his head."}, {"date": "20/12/2014", "arena": "White Hart Lane", "attendance": 35681, "home_team": {"name": "Tottenham Hotspur", "lineup": [{"name": "Hugo Lloris", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Walker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Federico Fazio", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jan Vertonghen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Davies", "yellows": [3], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nabil Bentaleb", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Mason", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [44]}, {"name": "Erik Lamela", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [35], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Eriksen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Nacer Chadli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Kane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [21], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [84]}], "subs": [{"name": "Danny Rose", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Vlad Chiriches", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Roberto Soldado", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [84], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michel Vorm", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andros Townsend", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mousa Dembélé", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Benjamin Stambouli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [44], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Burnley", "lineup": [{"name": "Tom Heaton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kieran Trippier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Keane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jason Shackell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Mee", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "George Boyd", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [79]}, {"name": "Dean Marney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Jones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Scott Arfield", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [80]}, {"name": "Danny Ings", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Barnes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [27], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [89]}], "subs": [{"name": "Ross Wallace", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [80], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Kightly", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [79], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Reid", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lukas Jutkiewicz", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [89], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathaniel Chalobah", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matthew Gilks", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin Long", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "When Érik Lamela’s left-footed rocket fizzed into the far corner of the Burnley net, it was tempting to think that it had been worth the wait. This was Lamela’s 26th Premier League appearance for Tottenham Hotspur since his record £30m move from Roma in the summer of last year and it was his first goal in the competition.\n\nWhat a goal it was, one that was worthy of deciding any match and one that fired a bit of momentum for his club, on the back of Wednesday’s Capital One Cup quarter-final win here over Newcastle United. Tottenham’s season has been scarred by their inability to beat teams who sit below them in the table at home and Burnley’s visit presented a test of their mentality.\n\nLamela’s goal helped them to pass it. He picked up the ball on the right and, with Ben Mee backing off, drifted inside before unleashing a vicious shot from 25 yards that had too much on it for the Burnley goalkeeper Tom Heaton. It was the high point of an individual performance that was marked by attacking menace but also a certain flakiness in defensive terms.\n\nTottenham dominated the possession but they came to look a little laboured in the second half, possibly as a result of it being their third game in seven days. The schedule does not get any easier.\n\nThere were positives for Burnley, which the manager, Sean Dyche, was keen to talk up, namely how they “affected Tottenham’s back four” and got forward more quickly than normal. Dyche’s habit of sticking with two up front away from home is extremely praiseworthy. “Sometimes you have to see through the result,” he said. “There is a future in that performance.”\n\nThere were patches of neat and energetic football and Burnley’s travelling fans, almost all of them resplendent in Santa hats, fervently believed. However, they could not bend the result to their will.\n\nHarry Kane put Tottenham in front with his 14th goal of the season and it followed a piece of quick thinking from him. Dyche complained about the award of a free-kick for handball against Michael Keane, arguing that the defender could not get out of the way, and Kane took it immediately, rolling the ball up towards Christian Eriksen. The Dane was offside, so he stopped and so did Burnley. Nacer Chadli did not and when he crossed, Kane was alone to nod home from close range.\n\nHe does not miss from that range. Well, actually, he can, as he proved on 31 minutes after Lamela had beaten Mee to cross. The ball then found its way to Kane who, from two yards out, somehow failed to make any connection.\n\nBy then, Burnley were level. David Jones robbed Lamela and George Boyd worked it to Ashley Barnes. The striker bent a beautiful shot into the roof of the net from outside the area.\n\nTottenham lost Ryan Mason to an ankle twist that looked serious, although Mauricio Pochettino later said that it was not, and the action continued to crackle. Kane was always a threat – aside from his goal he also banged one first-half effort beyond the far post – and Lamela’s screamer had the home team back in charge.\n\nBurnley enjoyed a purple patch at the beginning of the second half, with Danny Ings wriggling into space to work Hugo Lloris on three occasions. Pochettino had a simple instruction for his players: “Wake up,” he bellowed.\n\nTottenham were ragged in the second half; Burnley were the better team but, after the initial flurry, they never truly looked as though they would find a second equaliser, although the substitute Ross Wallace did test Lloris with a 90th-minute free-kick.

The only problem with that theory, however, is that while Carroll and Downing have arguably never played with this much confidence and inventiveness before, they are doing it in the claret and blue of West Ham United rather than the red of Liverpool.\n\nThese two have been hapless figures of fun who could seemingly do nothing right but Carroll and Downing are forcing their critics to revise their opinions with each sparkling display of match-winning virtuoso for West Ham. Carroll and Downing scored in each half to dampen Leicester City’s festive spirit and ensure that West Ham, who visit Chelsea on Boxing Day, will be fourth at Christmas for the first time since the 1985-86 season.\n\nFor Leicester, this was another worrying defeat and one that exposed flaws at both ends of the pitch. They did not play badly and were frustrated on several occasions by some superb late saves from Adrián in the West Ham goal but there is no escaping reality.\n\nLeicester are without a win in 12 matches and their gloom will intensify when they digest the information that in the Premier League era only West Bromwich Albion in 2005 and Sunderland last year have survived after being bottom on Christmas Day.\n\nAs heartening as it was for Nigel Pearson, who is yet to serve the one-match touchline ban he was handed by the Football Association on Friday, to hear the travelling supporters chanting his name, ultimately there were only scraps of encouragement for him to take from his side’s performance.\n\nLeicester were awkward opponents for West Ham at times and they certainly ran their socks off for their manager. Yet the learning curve since last season’s promotion has been steep. They are crying out for more quality at crucial moments and for all Leicester’s endeavour and persistence this ended up being another harsh lesson in doing the simple things well. “It doesn’t give us a great deal of satisfaction,” Pearson said. “It’s another day in which we’ve done OK in certain areas.”\n\nTake West Ham’s opener in the 24th minute, a horror moment for Paul Konchesky. There should have been no danger of a West Ham attack, let alone a goal, but the Leicester left-back dropped his team-mates in it with a backpass that went straight to Carroll, who beat Ben Hamer with a delightful and surprisingly subtle dink.\n\nThe applause for Konchesky, a former Hammer, was warm when he was taken off in the second half.\n\nIt was an important goal for Carroll, only the second time he has scored from open play for West Ham, and how he cherished it given that minutes earlier he had blazed over from six yards after a cutback from Downing.\n\nSam Allardyce’s side were not at their most coherent but, weirdly, they were given a new lease of life when Carroll slipped on the touchline and clattered face-first into the advertising hoardings. Upton Park roared when their apparently indestructible hero rose and minutes later, Diafra Sakho’s header dropped at Downing’s feet in the 56th minute.\n\nDowning has been an almost player in the past. He hit the crossbar on his Liverpool debut. He was almost very good. Yet he has been revitalised in his new central position at West Ham and his left-footed curler, bent high to Hamer’s right from 25 yards, was a stunning piece of skill.\n\n“Barcelona, we’re coming for you,” the West Ham fans sang and, to be fair, even Lionel Messi would have enjoyed that effort from Downing."}, {"date": "15/12/2014", "arena": "Goodison Park", "attendance": 34035, "home_team":

prizes for the best festive jumpers. Queens Park Rangers performed the role of obliging guest to perfection.\n\nGoals from Ross Barkley, Kevin Mirallas and Steven Naismith made it eight consecutive Premier League away defeats for Harry Redknapp’s team. Unless the recent improvement at Loftus Road is replicated on Rangers’ travels, 2015 will usher in only torment. Only one team in Premier League history has made a worse start on the road and Bolton Wanderers, who lost their first nine away matches in the 1995-96 season, finished bottom that year.\n\nEverton were not exactly accomplished themselves, yet it said everything about their opponents’ frailty in defence and lack of presence in attack that victory was rarely in doubt after Barkley’s emphatic opening goal.\n\nThe England international enjoyed his most productive performance of the season by far in the central midfield role he has long craved. His midfield partner Muhamed Besic, however, underpinned a much needed victory for Everton with a tenacious, intelligent display.\n\n“We gave away poor goals, that was the problem,” said Redknapp. “Until the first goal I’ve never felt so confident. I thought we had a big chance. But we gave the ball away cheaply for the first goal, which was a great strike from a fantastic young talent but a deflection changed the direction of the ball.\n\n“We gave away a free-kick for the second goal, which was another deflection, and we didn’t deserve to be 2-0 down. Everton were edgy. The crowd was edgy and their play was edgy. Even at 3-1 with 10 minutes to go, I felt we had a chance because they are not full of confidence.”\n\nThat was true of Everton’s start and their latest careless finish to a game but Barkley’s contribution in between was a timely reminder of the midfielder’s rare talent. Roberto Martínez’s team also possessed a threat in front of goal that QPR could not match. Only 350 visiting supporters made the trek to Merseyside for a Monday night game and the suspension of Charlie Austin, the only striker to score away from home for Rangers this term, plus a staggering record of 13 points from the club’s last 40 games in the top flight, may have been additional factors for the low turn-out.\n\nBarkley started in central midfield due to injury to James McCarthy, Darron Gibson and Leon Osman, plus Gareth Barry’s suspension, and relished the extra responsibility on the ball. It was only a few weeks ago that Martínez ruled out a central position for the England international, insisting it would be “a shame” to remove his creativity and explosive power from the final third. The midfielder’s response showed it does not have to be that way.\n\nHaving evaded Joey Barton in the centre circle and exchanged passes with Romelu Lukaku, the midfielder drove towards the left of the Rangers’ area before unleashing a powerful left-foot drive at Rob Green’s goal. The shot took a slight deflection off the back of Mauricio Isla and the pace of the shot left Green flailing as it found the top corner. It was the midfielder’s first goal since the memorable curler against Manchester City in May.\n\n“It was a real joy to watch Ross tonight,” said Martínez. “It was an exceptional finish and he deserved that for the work he has done in training and for wanting to take responsibility in the game.”\n\nA more generous deflection handed Everton a more comfortable lead. Barton was penalised for a foul on Naismith and, from the resulting free-kick, Mirallas’ shot struck Eduardo Vargas on the head and sailed beyond Green. The Belgium international was carried off on a stretcher in stoppage time with suspected ankle ligament damage following Jordon Mutch’s poor tackle.\n\nNaismith headed in the third via Green’s fingertips and the face of Nedum Onuoha after the goalkeeper and Richard Dunne both made a hash of clearances and enabled Aiden McGeady to pick out the Scot with a delightful cross to the back post.\n\nThe substitute Bobby Zamora tapped in a late reply after Tim Howard parried Mutch’s shot into his path but the wait for an away result for QPR goes on.

setback was complete, it was not easy to imagine how long it might be before this proud old club is a realistic contender again for another league title. The team who bewitched us last season are no more. The deterioration is sharp and football is such an impatient business Brendan Rodgers will know his status as manager-of-the-year does not spare him scrutiny.\n\nNine months ago Liverpool came here and, as Sir Alex Ferguson recalled in his autobiography, “battered us”, a 3-0 thumping that seemed to epitomise the David Moyes era at Manchester United and the brilliant work that Rodgers was apparently undertaking at the other end of the East Lancs Road. What is happening now makes it feel like all the momentum has been lost. No team can defend this badly and expect to get away with it and the disappointment of losing to the old enemy will hardly be soothed by the knowledge this is not even a terribly good United side. Dog and Duck 3, Red Lion 0? Not quite, but you knew what Gary Neville meant.\n\nThe difference is that Louis van Gaal’s team have re-established themselves on an upward curve and, though the quality of football still fell short, they have won six successive matches to establish a 10-point advantage over Liverpool in the skirmish for next season’s Champions League places. Chelsea are another eight points clear and, bearing in mind the story of last season’s title race, it is startling to see the way the team from Anfield have lost their way. There is a 21-point swing from the last time they visited Old Trafford.\n\nTheir lack of confidence could be seen in the performances of Joe Allen and Dejan Lovren, to name but two, or the sudden loss of self-belief that afflicted Raheem Sterling whenever he had a chance to round off some penetrative approach work by taking aim. Sterling, to give him his due, came up against a formidable goalkeeper. This was another wonderful performance from David de Gea, not just because of his uncommon hand-to-eye co-ordination but the way his best moments came in key periods of the game.\n\nConsider, for instance, what might have happened if Sterling, set free by Adam Lallana, had been able to get the ball past De Gea with the game’s first chance, when Liverpool had started reasonably well. The importance of that save has to be put into the context of what happened next. Within a few seconds, United had worked the ball to Antonio Valencia on the right. So often over the last couple of years Valencia has been reluctant to take on his man and resorted to drilling in low, aimless crosses. This time we saw the Valencia of 2011, slipping the ball through Allen’s legs for a beautifully delivered nutmeg, taking out two other opponents in the process and then having the presence of mind to pick out Rooney for the opening goal.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Louis van Gaal explains his decision to play Wayne Rooney in midfield against Liverpool\n\nDe Gea’s other highlights included two outstanding saves in the early parts of the second half, first to deny Sterling again and then turning a shot from the substitute Mario Balotelli against the crossbar. A goal at that time would have given Liverpool encouragement to think a feat of escapology was on. Instead, United broke on the counterattack and Lovren hashed an attempt to clear Rooney’s cross. Juan Mata picked up the loose ball, played a disguised pass to Robin van Persie on the right and the third goal went in.\n\nLiverpool were entitled to be aggrieved there was no offside flag when United made it 2-0, five minutes before half-time, when the only possible explanation was that the linesman did not notice Van Persie applying the faintest of touches from Ashley Young’s cross before Mata’s stooping header. A bad call, however, does not excuse the wonky defensive line, the absence of a credible challenge, or the way Alberto Moreno lost Mata at the far post. Rodgers had experimented with a three-man central defence but lost Glen Johnson to a first-half injury and his back line failed again. The best teams also defend all over the pitch and Philippe Coutinho’s half-hearted attempt to track Rooney for the first goal is a good example of why Rodgers said Liverpool needed to “recapture the team ethos”.\n\nFor United, Valencia was excellent, particularly in the first half. Mata played with great intelligence and Van Persie is clearly over that rough spell when his place was seriously under threat. There are, however, some obvious shortcomings, not helped by the seemingly ceaseless injury issues affecting their defenders. James Wilson struggled to make an impact on the day Van Gaal started the 19-year-old ahead of Radamel Falcao and Liverpool, despite their own failings, got behind the home defence so frequently it put a strange complexion on the final score. The paradox was that De Gea was man of the match by some distance, his brilliance made all the more pronounced because of the story at the other end.\n\nRodgers had chosen this occasion to drop Simon Mignolet but his replacement, Brad Jones, completely misread the trajectory of Rooney’s shot for the first goal, almost comically diving the wrong way. It was inexplicable and the hard evidence, perhaps, why Rodgers had persisted for so long with Mignolet. Yet Liverpool’s problems, languishing in mid-table, are not just consigned to goalkeeping issues.\n\nMan of the match David de Gea (Manchester United)"}, {"date": "14/12/2014", "arena": "The Liberty Stadium", "attendance": 20650, "home_team": {"name": "Swansea City", "lineup": [{"name": "Gerhard Tremmel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Angel Rangel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [70]}, {"name": "Kyle Bartley", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Williams", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Neil Taylor", "yellows": [82], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leon Britton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [55]}, {"name": "Sung-Yueng Ki", "yellows": [51], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wayne Routledge", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gylfi Sigurdsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jefferson Montero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wilfried Bony", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [48], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [85]}], "subs": [{"name": "Jordi Amat", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonjo Shelvey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [55], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marvin Emnes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathan Dyer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Cornell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bafétimbi Gomis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [85], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jazz Richards", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [70], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Tottenham Hotspur", "lineup": [{"name": "Hugo Lloris", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Walker", "yellows": [15], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Federico Fazio", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jan Vertonghen", "yellows": [35], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Davies", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Mason", "yellows": [41], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [70]}, {"name": "Nabil Bentaleb", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Erik Lamela", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [83]}, {"name": "Harry Kane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [4], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Eriksen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [89], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Roberto Soldado", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [56]}], "subs": [{"name": "Danny Rose", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Vlad Chiriches", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michel Vorm", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andros Townsend", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mousa Dembélé", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [56], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nacer Chadli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [83], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Benjamin Stambouli", "yellows": [83], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [70], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Two teams who play a pleasing passing game produced a smashing match on Sunday with a surprising denouement. Swansea were the better side, created the lion’s share of the chances and know they should have won but Tottenham dug deep and were rewarded for their resilience when Christian Eriksen burgled the winner after 89 minutes.\n\nNobody in the Premier League concedes potentially winning positions more often than Garry Monk’s Swans and so it was here. Equalising after 48 minutes, they went on to create sufficient goalscoring opportunities to have won comfortably, yet were left without so much as a point and only one victory in their past five league matches.\n\nSpurs took optimum advantage of their opponents’ profligacy to move up to seventh in the table. Mauricio Pochettino, their Argentinian manager, said he did not understand the English phrase “smash and grab” but admitted: “Swansea played better than us. It is very important to show character and fight in such situations and we did that to get a very important win against a very good team.”\n\nThey took the lead in the fourth minute when Eriksen’s corner from the right led to Harry Kane, seven yards out, outjumping Àngel Rangel to head into the far corner. Tottenham’s supporters saluted the scorer, who represents an endangered species as a youth-team product, as “one of our own”. Kane has 11 goals from 20 appearances in all competitions this season.\n\nThe Swans hit back hard, Wilfried Bony threatening to equalise almost immediately when his low drive from the edge of the D brought a decent save from Hugo Lloris. After 20 minutes it took a last-ditch tackle by Ben Davies, playing against his former club, to dispossess the burly Ivorian in front of goal.\n\nBony, predatory and persistent, was soon back, fastening eagerly on to Rangel’s cross only to be denied again by Lloris. When he tried his luck again his shot, which was on target, was deflected behind off Federico Fazio.\n\nSwansea should have been ahead by half-time but for once Bony’s finishing was less than exemplary. He put that right within three minutes of the resumption, stabbing the ball home at the second attempt after his initial one rebounded to him off Fazio’s body. It was Bony’s eighth goal in his past 10 Premier League appearances and no player has scored more than his 20 in 2014.\n\nSpurs tried to sign him last summer but were unable to come up with the money required. Their interest was entirely understandable here. In comparison their own No9, Roberto Soldado, was utterly anonymous, again looking anything but a £26m striker. He was substituted after 56 minutes after a contribution that was in stark contrast to that of the combative Bony, who cost Swansea less than half the Spaniard’s fee.\n\nKane, with a twisting header, was only inches away for Tottenham but a draw was the least Swansea deserved. Instead, right at the end Ashley Richards, on as substitute, carelessly conceded possession to Davies and Eriksen scored with a low shot from 18 yards which flew in past Gerhard Tremmel’s right hand.\n\nMonk described the outcome as “sickening”. He said: “I couldn’t see that coming. Two individual errors cost us two goals and the result. We created enough chances to have scored a number of goals but didn’t do it because we weren’t clinical enough.\n\n“You have to kill teams off in that situation and we didn’t do that but coming away with nothing is hard to take. In the second half it was one-way traffic and, if it had been a boxing match, it would have been stopped. It was an injustice but you don’t always get what you deserve. “\n\nPochettino, Spurs’ third manager since Harry Redknapp left in June 2012, believes he is at last getting across the philosophy which served Southampton so well last season.\n\nHe said: “When you arrive at a different club with different players, as I found at Southampton, you need time to put your ideas into practice.\n\n“We are in a very good way now, and I am very happy with the players. I was very pleased today because we started to show the character we want. We are fighting in every situation and we have a lot of good players and young talent. With time we will improve even more.”\n\nMan of the match Harry Kane (Tottenham Hotspur)"}, {"date": "13/12/2014", "arena": "Turf Moor", "attendance": 17287, "home_team": {"name": "Burnley", "lineup": [{"name": "Tom Heaton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kieran Trippier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Keane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jason Shackell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Mee", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [74]}, {"name": "George Boyd", "yellows": [83], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dean Marney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Jones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Scott Arfield", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Barnes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [73], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Ings", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Daniel Lafferty", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [74], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ross Wallace", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Kightly", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lukas Jutkiewicz", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathaniel Chalobah", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matthew Gilks", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin Long", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Southampton", "lineup": [{"name": "Fraser Forster", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathaniel Clyne", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "José Fonte", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Toby Alderweireld", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Bertrand", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Wanyama", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Davis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jake Hesketh", "yellows": [17], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [32]}, {"name": "Dusan Tadic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [60], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sadio Mané", "yellows": [39], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [78]}, {"name": "Graziano Pellè", "yellows": [83], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Kelvin Davis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Maya Yoshida", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Florin Gardos", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Ward-Prowse", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [32], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Emmanuel Mayuka", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harrison Reed", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shane Long", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [78], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Southampton do not miss penalties. Other clubs might but, over more than two decades of excellence from 12 yards, Southampton did not. They established a reputation as the spot-kick specialists. Seeing Matt Le Tissier, James Beattie or Rickie Lambert step up amounted to a guarantee of a goal.\n\nYet nothing lasts forever. Southampton missed a penalty here and, to borrow from cliche, paid the penalty. Ashley Barnes delivered Burnley’s winner after Dusan Tadic was denied by Tom Heaton, ending Saints’ run of 29 consecutive Premier League successes from the spot. While one sequence ended, another less welcome one was extended. Southampton have now lost four games in a row.\n\nTheir best-ever start to a top-flight campaign is a fading memory. The statistical oddity at Turf Moor came courtesy of Heaton, who joined the select band to stop Southampton penalties in the Premier League. He can now be bracketed alongside Nottingham Forest’s Mark Crossley, who denied Le Tissier his 100% record in 1993.\n\nHeaton’s historic moment brought praise from his manager. “An outstanding save rather than a miss,” insisted Burnley’s Sean Dyche. Koeman, drawing on his own set-piece expertise during his playing days, begged to disagree. “It is good goalkeeping but it is a bad penalty,” the Dutchman said. “It is strange because Tadic is a specialist. I know his record in Holland.”\n\nUntil recently, Burnley victories had a similar rarity value to Tadic’s misses but this was their third triumph in six games. Relentless running is starting to bring a reward and their pressing game led directly to the decider. Fraser Forster was fooled by the deflection that Barnes’s shot took off Toby Alderweireld after the effervescent Danny Ings charged down Nathaniel Clyne’s clearance. “I was really impressed by how Danny worked for the team,” Dyche added.\n\nOnce again, Koeman was nonplussed. “I call it a mistake because it is our throw-in and it ended with a goal from Burnley,” he said.\n\nErrors have begun to creep into Southampton’s game. “It is not the first time,” said Koeman. “That is why we don’t win today, why we don’t win against Manchester United and why we had a row of winning games. It is all about scoring chances and [not making] mistakes in defence. In the last two games, we had more chances.” He departed Turf Moor rueing Victor Wanyama’s late header which cleared the crossbar.\n\nClyne also grazed the post with a 30-yard thunderbolt. Nevertheless, Burnley just about shaded it. “You need a scratch of luck,” Dyche said. “We got that with the goal. They are the margins. We have been on the wrong side of those and sometimes undeservedly so.”\n\nNow a buoyant Burnley have elevated themselves from the relegation zone. “They had an unbelievable spirit,” said Koeman and, if the Clarets are to survive, their willingness to run mile after mile will be a prime reason.\n\nIn George Boyd and Kieran Trippier, they also had a right-sided partnership with menace. Their incursions threatened to lead to a goal when Boyd crossed and Clyne, attempting to cushion the ball back to Forster, applied rather too much power, requiring the goalkeeper to make a fine save. Yet having troubled Ryan Bertrand, Boyd tripped the Southampton left-back when he burst forward, conceding the penalty. It was one of the referee Mark Clattenburg’s simpler decisions.\n\nThe first flashpoint concerned a newcomer. Jake Hesketh, an 18-year-old who idolises Andrés Iniesta, was granted his first start by Koeman. While he showed composure on the ball, his most notable contribution could be attributed to youthful exuberance. Some in the crowd called for a red card when Hesketh slid in on Heaton. Clattenburg compromised by cautioning the teenager.\n\nHesketh was removed after being hurt in a shuddering collision with Michael Keane, “There were two yellow cards in the first half and he didn’t punish that foul,” Koeman noted.\n\nYet if Hesketh is further proof Southampton possess an excellent academy, they were left to rue one who got away. Ings was released as a schoolboy and took the circuitous route to the Premier League via Dorchester and Bournemouth. The former Saint hassled and harried his old employers into the crucial error, his energy giving Burnley momentum just as Southampton are losing it."}, {"date": "13/12/2014", "arena": "Stamford Bridge", "attendance": 41626, "home_team": {"name": "Chelsea", "lineup": [{"name": "Petr Cech", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Branislav Ivanovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gary Cahill", "yellows": [38], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Terry", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Filipe Luis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Mikel Obi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [82]}, {"name": "Nemanja Matic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willian", "yellows": [31], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [80]}, {"name": "Oscar", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [78]}, {"name": "Eden Hazard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [7], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Diego Costa", "yellows": [58], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [68], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Kurt Zouma", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ramires", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [82], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Didier Drogba", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [78], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "André Schürrle", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [80], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Loïc Remy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mark Schwarzer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "César Azpilicueta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Hull City", "lineup": [{"name": "Allan McGregor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ahmed Elmohamady", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Chester", "yellows": [66], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Dawson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [10]}, {"name": "Curtis Davies", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andrew Robertson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jake Livermore", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Huddlestone", "yellows": [15], "reds": [60], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Meyler", "yellows": [26], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nikica Jelavic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [74]}, {"name": "Sone Aluko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [64]}], "subs": [{"name": "Liam Rosenior", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex Bruce", "yellows": [57], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [10], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Abel Hernandez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robbie Brady", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [64], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eldin Jakupovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gaston Ramirez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [74], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stephen Quinn", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "This was an ugly win rather prised from stubborn and awkward opponents but, in the end, Chelsea will be unconcerned as to how it was chiselled out. Their three-point advantage at the top of the Premier League is retained, a pristine home record extended and they may actually take heart from the reality that rivals can these days be ground into submission when they cannot be passed off the park.\n\nIt still felt comfortable enough, secured by an early headed goal from the lively Eden Hazard and a welcome reward after the interval for Diego Costa. The Brazilian-born forward had been relatively blunt of late, struggling with his match sharpness after those hamstring and groin complaints, but he tucked away a neat finish to settle the result. Yet the rest was more of a slog, an occasion illuminated more by Branislav Ivanovic’s muscular running beyond Hull City defenders down the right than flashes of neat invention from the attacking players who have propelled this team to date.\n\nJosé Mourinho said: “We didn’t play especially well, but we played well enough for everybody connected with Chelsea – supporters, players, staff – to be calm because the game was always under control. We never felt really at risk. We have already put in many special performances this season, and today we just had moments of good football, moments of happiness and creativity and dynamism. Just moments. Not for 90 minutes. A good enough performance to win against a difficult team, which is important to say.”\n\nThe Portuguese went on to suggest some of his players may have spied the fixture congestion ahead and opted to rest up once victory here felt assured. “If they did, they are smart,” he offered although, while the manager was loath to admit it, the suspended Cesc Fàbregas had still been missed. Chelsea’s tempo was rarely as upbeat as normal without the Spaniard conducting play from the middle even once Hull had been reduced to 10 by Tom Huddlestone’s dismissal for an ugly challenge on Filipe Luís.\n\nSteve Bruce argued, quite plausibly, that lunge had been born of frustration that the hosts had not been reduced to 10 after Gary Cahill, already cautioned, appeared to dive between David Meyler and Huddlestone in search of a penalty. Chris Foy would book Willian and Costa for “simulation” over the course of the contest, but Cahill escaped to leave the visitors riled.\n\nThe Hull manager was just as perplexed as to why Mikel John Obi was not penalised for a foul on Sone Aluko in the build-up to Hazard’s opening goal. “We thought it was a free-kick, but if I say what I want to say then I’ll be hauled up in front of the Football Association again and I’ll have to pay the £10,000 fine,” said Bruce, who had suffered that indignity last season. “So I’ll say piss all about it and save my pocket. Excuse my French.”\n\nHis current Français, Hatem Ben Arfa, might have been useful here had he been fit and available, though his days at Hull appear numbered with the player secured from Newcastle in Paris and apparently hoping his contract is terminated next month.\n\nHull lacked the creation or conviction to damage the league leaders – they have now gone nine games without a win – even if their industry was admirable. Bruce wrote it off as “the story of our season”. The loss of Michael Dawson to a hamstring injury, most likely for up to six weeks, will be damaging.\n\nThey were pierced twice amid the huff and puff, Hazard soaring between Curtis Davies and Andrew Robertson to connect with Oscar’s cross while Aluko writhed on the turf in the centre circle following Mikel’s challenge. Hazard had previously scored only once in England with his head, against West Bromwich Albion in November 2012, and was elusive throughout following a midweek rest. Mourinho said: “I gave him four days’ holiday with his family to go somewhere he can take his shirt [off] and get some sun. He came back with happiness in his legs.”\n\nCosta, too, needed his reward after relatively stodgy recent form. He meandered on to Hazard’s slipped pass to score beyond Allan McGregor with Hull depleted in number and, by then, effectively defeated."}, {"date": "13/12/2014", "arena": "Selhurst Park", "attendance": 23038, "home_team": {"name": "Crystal Palace", "lineup": [{"name": "Julian Speroni", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Kelly", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Scott Dann", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Brede Hangeland", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joel Ward", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James McArthur", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [11], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [85]}, {"name": "Mile Jedinak", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Ledley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wilfried Zaha", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [61]}, {"name": "Marouane Chamakh", "yellows": [67], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [77]}, {"name": "Yannick Bolasie", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Fraizer Campbell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wayne Hennessey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jerome Thomas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dwight Gayle", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [77], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Barry Bannan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [85], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Damien Delaney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jason Puncheon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [61], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Stoke City", "lineup": [{"name": "Asmir Begovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Bardsley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Shawcross", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marc Wilson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Erik Pieters", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Geoff Cameron", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven N'Zonzi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jon Walters", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bojan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [55]}, {"name": "Mame Biram Diouf", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Peter Crouch", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [13], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Robert Huth", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Glenn Whelan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stephen Ireland", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marko Arnautovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [55], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charlie Adam", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Butland", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Oussama Assaidi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "You could call this match a great advertisement for the Bundesliga, the Championship or fixing that broken shelf in the bathroom. It would be unfair to dismiss it as a complete non-event because both teams scored and collected a point – thanks to James McArthur and Peter Crouch – but distrust anyone who claims it was not gruelling viewing.\n\n“It was like a war of attrition,” said Neil Warnock. “If I was a journalist I’d probably put that in the first paragraph.”\n\nThe temperature at kick-off was close to freezing and there was a definite chill in the dug-outs as Warnock and Mark Hughes competed against each other for the first time since Warnock accused the Welshman of destroying his Queens Park Rangers side after succeeding him as their manager in 2012.\n\nThe curtness of the pre-match handshake showed that neither man was overly concerned with pretending their relationship has thawed and there was little on the pitch to warm the supporters either.\n\nThe teams started as if they had just emerged from hibernation rather than come off the back of positive performances against north London giants. It was a shock when, after 11 minutes of nothingness, Palace plundered a goal. Less surprising was the fact that Yannick Bolasie created it. The winger who had tormented Tottenham Hotspur last week twisted and jigged his way down the left before dispatching a cross that James McArthur headed into the net as Marc Wilson, the one newcomer to Stoke’s line-up since last week’s win at Arsenal, stood staring.\n\nPalace’s inability to take any of the many opportunities that they created at White Hart Lane had exasperated Warnock, so the manager was aghast when they threw away their lead here within 91 seconds of finally converting a chance. After a Palace attack broke down, Bojan Krkic darted past Scott Dann and into the area and pulled a ball back for Jonathan Walters, whose shot deflected off Mile Jedinak into the path of Crouch. The striker rolled it into the net from close range. “We should not get caught on the counter like that,” Warnock said.\n\nAfter that two-minute goal-splurge, stagnation set in again. Amid the detritus of the rest of the first half Bolasie, Bojan and, to a lesser extent, Wilfried Zaha were the only sources of creativity. In the 26th minute Bolasie launched into another of his anarchic escapades down the left before slipping a sly pass through to McArthur. Asmir Begovic saved at the near post.\n\nFour minutes before the break Bolasie released Zaha, who forced another near-post stop from Begovic.\n\nEven the normally boisterous home crowd were relatively subdued in the first half. Palace tried to turn up the heat in the second period. As the hosts worked up a head of steam, Stoke had to withdraw Krkic, their most inventive player suffering a knock that is not expected to keep him out for long but prevented him from continuing here.\n\nBegovic had to fling himself across his goal to paw away a rasping low shot from 25 yards by McArthur and Palace continued to rumble forward but seldom looked like infiltrating a defence led by Ryan Shawcross.\n\nPlay remained pungent until there was a vague whiff of excitement in the 88th minute, Crouch seizing on a breaking ball in the Palace area to poke the ball softly towards the goal. Julián Speroni saved easily.\n\nShortly afterwards the full-time whistle woke everyone up so they could go home. “The sides cancelled each other out in the second half,” Hughes said.\n\nHaving won one of the last 10 matches, Warnock is looking to the January transfer window for solutions. “We really should have won our last five games,” he said. “We’ve got to get two or three players as quickly as possible.”"}, {"date": "13/12/2014", "arena": "The King Power Stadium", "attendance": 31643, "home_team": {"name": "Leicester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Ben Hamer", "yellows": [], "reds": [],

tearfully off the Etihad Stadium pitch prompted some to suggest Manchester City’s season was about to implode, although they went on to beat Everton 1-0. Seven days on, the champions have opened a new £200m academy and training complex, qualified for the last 16 of the Champions League and completed a fifth successive victory in the Premier League. As responses to a setback go, not so dusty.\n\nThis was not a win without cost for City, however. Manuel Pellegrini is rarely noticeably upbeat but the Chilean was even more lugubrious than usual in confirming his captain, Vincent Kompany, who had not been risked in Rome, had pulled his suspect hamstring when he had to be replaced with 13 minutes remaining.\n\nOf even more immediate concern, though, was the fact Edin Dzeko was forced to pull out with a calf problem before kick-off, after being named in the starting line-up.\n\nWith Stevan Jovetic, who came on as a substitute in Italy, unavailable due to a hamstring problem, City could be facing the Christmas period without their three main forwards.\n\n“We’ll have to play another way, keep a clean sheet as we did today,” shrugged Pellegrini. He must know the young José Ángel Pozo, asked to lead the line in Dzeko’s absence at the King Power, is not the answer. The teenager did his best, but he is a lightweight, not strong enough to hold the ball up and bring others into play.\n\nFor all that Pellegrini did his best to refresh his side – Dzeko’s withdrawal meant only three of the team which started in Rome started here – he found himself watching a laboured performance, during which City rarely got out of second gear. In that respect this was an opportunity for Leicester, but Nigel Pearson’s side lacked both the confidence and cutting edge to take it.\n\nThe Foxes should have taken the lead when Jamie Vardy’s pace down the middle saw him run away from first Kompany and then Eliaquim Mangala in the 12th minute. The young French defender did well to get back and get a foot in to deflect Vardy’s shot wide, but the Leicester striker should have got his effort away earlier.\n\nTen minutes later, with the visitors yet to fashion an attempt on goal, Esteban Cambiasso curled a 30 yard free-kick a foot wide, with Joe Hart desperately scrambling. The two men exchanged grins, though whether Hart would have been smiling if the ball had crept inside his left-hand post is doubtful.\n\nIt was half an hour before the home goalkeeper, Ben Hamer, was actually called into serious action, punching away a David Silva corner and then easily catching Pozo’s side-footed volley. The save from Yaya Touré low to his left a few minutes later that followed City’s best passing move of the half was of a much higher quality, and it certainly had to be.\n\nHaving finally begun to move the ball at pace, the visitors continued to cause problems. Samir Nasri, neat and creative, found space on the left courtesy of Frank Lampard, and having teased and turned Wes Morgan, pulled the ball back across goal for Lampard, whose run into the box had not been picked up, to turn past Hamer from close range. It was the former Chelsea midfielder’s 175th Premier League goal, drawing him level with Thierry Henry in fourth position in that competition’s goalscoring charts. And, of course, football didn’t really exist previously.\n\nNothing really changed over the rest of the game. The Leicester manager, Nigel Pearson, eventually switched to two up front, but for all their efforts, his side could not create another chance. Nasri tested Hamer but this was a case of doing enough.\n\n“They showed why they are champions, scored a goal out of nothing and didn’t really create anything else,” said Pearson, who was treated with marked politeness by the supporters after the altercation during the game against Liverpool which has resulted in his facing an FA charge.\n\n“We are on the receiving end of another defeat and I don’t think we deserved to be but that’s how it is. There’s no point me being anything other than rational about it.\n\n“When you’re adrift that makes it even more difficult psychologically, but I don’t think our players looked like they lacked belief and that will be important.”"}, {"date": "13/12/2014", "arena": "Stadium of Light", "attendance": 41694, "home_team": {"name": "Sunderland", "lineup": [{"name": "Costel Pantilimon", "yellows": [],

"Andy Carroll’s declaration that West Ham United are title contenders was made to look slightly optimistic by the divisional draw specialists. Sunderland have won only two of their 16 Premier League games this season but 10 have ended all square and Sam Allardyce’s players were the latest set of visitors to leave Wearside in a frustrated mood.\n\nAlthough Gus Poyet’s side could quite easily have ended up winning a surprisingly open game, featuring an extraordinary miss on poor Jozy Altidore’s part, West Ham were the slightly better, infinitely more fluent, side.\n\nIf Stewart Downing, apparently re-born in his new “in the hole” role was their outstanding individual, Carroll gave John O’Shea and Wes Brown an exacting work out and, despite failing to score, the former Newcastle United centre-forward was certainly not deterred by receiving a little early discouragement from Lee Cattermole. By accidentally on purpose leaving a foot in on the No9, Cattermole not only ensured his studs caught Carroll just beneath the ankle but earned a loud cheer.\n\nThe striker, who has a history of troublesome injuries in that area, grimaced in pain but continued to ask the defence awkward questions. Indeed, when James Tomkins brushed Adam Johnson in the back and the winger tumbled over in the area, the goal came very much against the early run of play.\n\nIt seemed the softest of penalties but Jordi Gómez had no complaints about Phil Dowd’s view being obscured and happily sent Adrián the wrong way with a textbook low kick into the bottom corner. “Johnson dived,” Allardyce said. “It was a poor decision.”\n\nPoyet demurred. “That’s a little harsh of Sam,” he said. “I didn’t think it was a penalty but it wasn’t a dive, the defender was bigger and stronger.”\n\nAllardyce – once a Sunderland centre-half – went into incandescent mode, ranting at all the available officials after Gomez’s conversion, but appeared a little happier when Downing equalised. During his Middlesbrough days, Downing enjoyed an extremely successful loan spell here but when Sunderland neglected to close him down he disappointed his former public by unleashing a low, angled, left-foot shot from the edge of the area.\n\nCourtesy of a deflection off Gómez it flew past Costel Pantilimon, punishing Sunderland for a lack of cohesion. Despite this disjointed persona they would still have regained their lead had Altidore not misplaced his shooting boots.\n\nWhen Sebastian Larsson, quietly impressive throughout, delivered a brilliant right-wing cross, the USA striker was well placed to divert it into the back of the net from around two yards. Despite Larsson’s dispatch falling straight in front of his feet he somehow missed the ball, his agonising failure to extend a boot meaning it bounced harmlessly off his knee.\n\nA collective groan echoed around the stadium and a grateful Carl Jenkinson cleared. Altidore looked close to tears after apparently freezing at the vital moment. Poyet was nonplussed. “I don’t know what happened,” he said afterwards. “Jozy was devastated, I’ve never seen him like this. It was the difference between winning and losing.”\n\nIf Downing, who surely deserves a fresh chance with England after glittering at the apex of Allardyce’s diamond, did not deserve to lose, his side’s sluggish start to the second half suggested their current lofty League position may be slightly false.\n\nAlthough Carroll, who would later volley fractionally wide, chipped a shot on to the roof of the net Sunderland might have won a penalty for handball against Winston Reid before Connor Wickham shot narrowly over the bar.\n\n“The Reid handball was unintentional,” said Allardyce. “Two wrongs don’t make a right.”\n\nNonetheless, West Ham’s manager seemed happier with a point than Poyet. Fed up with constantly drawing, the Uruguayan looked downcast. “We’re defending well and we’re trying but we should be playing better,” he said. “We need more quality but I knew that six months ago.”"}, {"date": "13/12/2014", "arena": "The Hawthorns", "attendance": 24684, "home_team": {"name": "West Bromwich Albion", "lineup": [{"name": "Ben Foster", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals":

twice about offering Craig Gardner a high five the next time his midfielder scores but the West Bromwich Albion manager was only too happy to feel the sting as the former Aston Villa player’s first goal for his latest Midlands club settled this derby to alleviate the pressure hovering over the Hawthorns hot seat.\n\nGardner rifled home the winner 18 minutes from time as West Brom made heavy weather of capitalising on playing with a numerical advantage for three quarters of the game after Kieran Richardson was sent off for a reckless tackle on Stéphane Sessègnon.\n\nThe former Birmingham City player responded to his goal by sprinting over to the touchline to slap hands with Irvine, whose position has come under scrutiny after a run of one point from five games, and has said how much the team have been behind the manager.\n\n“The players have been brilliant, they really have,” Irvine said. “I’m absolutely delighted with the way they go about their business on a day-to-day basis. It’s nice of Craig to say that, but I wouldn’t have minded who he went and celebrated with.\n\n“My hand is still stinging, so I might ask him to go somewhere else next time! But he’s been a great pro since the first day he came in. He’s been absolutely desperate to score – and you could see how much it meant for him to score today.” He acknowledged the player is a Birmingham City fan. “So I understand, but I think he’s a West Brom fan at this particular moment.”\n\nThe future of both managers had been the subject of debate this autumn after mundane starts to the season but successive wins for Aston Villa had given Paul Lambert some breathing space. Now Irvine can sleep a bit more easily after a first victory in six attempts.\n\nGardner’s breakthrough came after Irvine made an astute tactical change, bringing Saido Berahino off the bench onto the right wing, with Sessègnon moving back into the hole off Ideye Brown and Silvestre Varela stretching play on the left wing.\n\nThis served to unsettle Villa, who had defended very well, and within two minutes of the change came the goal. Berahino crossed from the right and Brad Guzan failed to make clean contact as he attempted to punch clear under pressure from Ideye. Sessègnon’s effort was blocked and Gardner slashed home the rebound to spark rare celebrations around the Hawthorns. After witnessing defeats in their last three home games, the Albion crowd did stay with the team and the manager throughout.\n\nGardner was renowned as a goalscoring midfielder in his days at Villa Park under Martin O’Neill and at Birmingham City, his boyhood club, but this timely maiden goal could prove hugely significant as West Brom seek some managerial stability a year to the weekend since dismissing Steve Clarke, leading to the ill-fated reign of Pepe Mel before Irvine’s appointment in the summer.\n\nChristian Benteke diverted one attempt narrowly past the far post and then sliced another clearer opening past the target in the dying minutes as Villa attempted to make it six league games unbeaten for the first time under Lambert. But West Brom deservedly hung on.\n\nLambert had no complaints, over either Richardson’s red card or his team’s performance. “I can see why the referee sent him off,” the Villa manager said. “His second touch, he over-hit, but in the modern game, if you raise your studs, the referee will give a card. His enthusiasm to get the ball back probably got him sent off.\n\n“I thought we were the better team at that stage. It’s a big compliment to the team because for 70 minutes you wouldn’t have known we were down to 10 men. There’s a way to lose in football. I’m disappointed to lose but not disappointed with the way we played.”\n\nAlbion were much better at keeping the ball but had only one other clearcut chance before the interval, Sessègnon side-footed shot saved superbly by Guzan at point-blank range after Sébastien Pocognoli’s pull-back. But they cranked up the pressure in the second half and deserved their win."}, {"date": "13/12/2014", "arena": "Emirates Stadium", "attendance": 59949, "home_team": {"name": "Arsenal", "lineup":

existence marked by kneejerk reactions and the extremes of emotion but this was an occasion when the verdict was jauntily positive.\n\nOlivier Giroud was the star turn, ably assisted by Santi Cazorla and Alexis Sánchez, as Arsenal showed their attacking mojo, and their fifth win in six matches in all competitions was closed out to a raucous chant from the home support, which reminded everybody that their manager was unique.\n\nIt was quite a difference to the division that followed the defeat at Stoke City the previous Saturday, when Arsenal fans had fought among themselves and Wenger was jeered by a small group of them afterwards. The Frenchman shrugged. It is simply the way of the world, he suggested.\n\n“I have worked for 18 years in this country and I have been accepted 99.9% with a big respect,” Wenger said. “I can take the 0.1% and live with it. My job is to make people happy. If they are not happy, I have to live with it.”\n\nThe natives were happy here. It was an evening when the anti-Wenger lobby had to keep schtum and the team’s vim and vigour held sway, even if there were a few nerves among the home fans after Ayoze Pérez’s smartly directed header brought a lifeline for Newcastle United that they had barely threatened.\n\nThe visitors briefly forced the issue in Arsenal’s defensive third, getting balls into the box, and there was the sense that another goal might have sparked anxiety. Instead, it was Arsenal who had the final word when, after Paul Dummett’s clumsy challenge on Danny Welbeck, Cazorla executed a panenka penalty to round off his performance on his 30th birthday.\n\n“You could see that we were a bit edgy, when we were 3-1 – the crowd as well – there was the ghost of Anderlecht here a little bit,” Wenger said, with a nod towards the 3-3 Champions League draw against the Belgium club, a tie that Arsenal had led 3-0. “We need a few more games.”\n\nAlan Pardew, the Newcastle manager, also sensed that “the demons might return from Anderlecht” and he lamented the first-half moments when Welbeck appeared to handle inside the area, only for the referee, Lee Mason, to overlook the penalty appeal and Wojciech Szczesny produced a double save to deny Yoan Gouffran and Papiss Cissé following Jack Colback’s free-kick.\n\nBut Pardew was gracious enough to admit that perhaps his team did not deserve to get back into it and it had been Arsenal’s day. The statistics showed that Wenger’s team had mustered four shots on target, so this was a triumph of no little ruthlessness and Giroud certainly seems to have the bit between his teeth when he faces Newcastle. The centre-forward now has six Premier League goals against them in five appearances from only eight shots on target. He provided an eye-catching focal point for his team.\n\nArsenal opened at pace. They refused to permit Newcastle any time on the ball and the opening goal came when Héctor Bellerín pressed high to win possession. Sánchez took over and his perfectly weighted cross from the right invited Giroud to rise and power a header past Jak Alnwick.\n\nNewcastle had been warned, when Per Mertesacker sent a looping header from Cazorla’s corner over Alnwick and against the crossbar, and, after Giroud’s first goal, Welbeck had the ball in the net only to be pulled back for a trip on Daryl Janmaat. Mason’s interpretation of the law was strict.\n\nThe game was dotted by controversial moments, with the first having come at the very start, when Cheik Tioté was guilty of a reckless high challenge. The Newcastle enforcer planted his studs into Sánchez’s midriff and it was a surprise that Mason took no action. Tioté was eventually booked for a scything foul on Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain in the 60th minute.\n\nPardew complained about Mason’s decision to overlook Welbeck’s apparent handball in the 33rd minute while Arsenal had their own penalty claim at the end of the first half when Dummett barged over Sánchez. When the contact started, Sánchez had been just inside the area. Arsenal’s thrusting football carried the day. They created other chances in the first half and their levels did not drop at the beginning of the second period, when they menaced Newcastle with a one-two punch. First, Cazorla swapped passes with Sánchez, wriggled away from Fabricio Coloccini and finished with a wonderful chip into the far, top corner. Then Giroud closed on Bellerin’s driven low cross to score with an extravagant flick.\n\nPardew said: “A lot of credit has to go to Arsenal. They came out flying and we were hanging on during that purple patch.\n\n“It was too open for my liking in the second half and we were punished. The front four of Arsenal gave us a tough evening. The one thing I can say about my team is that we don’t give up.

Louis van Gaal’s side forced a fifth successive victory here, a win achieved in spite of clear defensive frailties, to suggest that they are the most likely contenders from the pack to challenge the duopoly at the top.\n\nEven with that burst of form behind them the pursuit still appears unlikely and quite whether a team so awkwardly thrown together at the back can sustain a long-term challenge, given the power of Chelsea and Manchester City, remains to be seen. Yet the thought of United building up a head of steam with funds to spend in January could yet prove unnerving to all-comers. This may have been an opportune time to visit Southampton, a team shorn of too many key performers, but the visitors departed having risen to third and heartened to have achieved success from a mishmash of a display.\n\nThey admitted as much afterwards, the matchwinner Robin van Persie conceding they had not played well and Van Gaal claiming that only three of his players had justified their reputation. Southampton, as “the better team”, had apparently merited more. Gary Neville, up in his pundit’s role for television, went further to claim United had “got away with murder” – an assessment that provoked a rather more prickly reaction from his former club’s manager. Liverpool await on Sunday, a game between “pub teams” according to Neville but a fixture to have the juices flowing. At some stage this side’s deficiencies will return to haunt them but at present they have momentum.\n\nThis ended up seeming ruthless. The three attempts at goal mustered by United represented their fewest in the Premier League in 11 years and, if it was appropriate that Van Persie should determine the result of this division’s first game between Dutch managers, the win had seemed implausible for long periods. United had hardly stirred as an attacking force since taking an early lead courtesy of the first of Southampton’s gifts and weathered regular pressure thereafter until Wayne Rooney’s free-kick from deep looped over the clutter in the six-yard box. And there was Van Persie, with Marouane Fellaini just as untracked at his back, having meandered on to the looped delivery with ease. He prodded his finish through Fraser Forster’s legs from close range and the Saints were beaten.\n\nRonald Koeman was deflated by how obliging his own charges had been against opponents who appeared there for the taking. José Fonte had set the tone with his errant backpass early on, delivered as Van Persie burst beyond him on his blind side to intercept and convert cleverly beyond a distraught goalkeeper. United created nothing else of note. “We deserved more,” grumbled the home manager. “I said to my players: ‘It’s easy, in my opinion, we were beaten by Manchester United tonight. We lost by ourselves.’”\n\nThis was a third successive defeat but the trickiest to digest, given how ramshackle the visitors had appeared at the back. United lost Chris Smalling to a groin strain early on and hooked Paddy McNair off before the first half was up almost as a mercy, Van Gaal having grown alarmed at the mistakes that littered the youngster’s game. He had almost presented Shane Long with the lead – not the only opportunity spurned by the Irishman – and had been one of those panicked by Steve Davis’s burst just after the half-hour which culminated in Dusan Tadic’s choked shot and Graziano Pellè’s slammed equaliser. McNair was left appearing a scapegoat, even if the Italian’s first goal in a little under 10 hours owed more to Fellaini surrendering possession weakly in the centre.\n\nBy the interval the visitors were employing Michael Carrick as a third centre-half while Jonny Evans desperately tried to rediscover some rhythm on his first appearance since the 5-3 capitulation at Leicester in September. Every permutation of United’s rearguard looks fragile at present, the three-man combination far too awkward and neither Antonio Valencia or Ashley Young convincing as a wing-back. Southampton should have capitalised but Long’s point-blank header was smartly pushed away by David de Gea, who later saved superbly from Pellè. The goalkeeper has had to be United’s most consistent performer this term out of necessity.\n\nYet this team is still finding a way to prevail. Those 3m shares put up for sale by Edward Glazer during the game may have been worth rather more by the final whistle, when United had established themselves as the nearest challengers to the top two. “It’s fantastic now to be third in the table,” added Van Gaal before the realism kicked in yet again. “But I’d hope we’d do that with a better performance because, tonight, we were the lucky team.”"},

unbridled. It all came tumbling out the moment his second battering ram of a header careered into the net. He ran like a man possessed all the way back to the halfway line, where Sam Allardyce was pumping his fist and wore a look of pure satisfaction.\n\nWest Ham won this battle of the surprise packages and needed the character to come from a goal behind to do so. If their renaissance this season seems to owe much to being liberated in attack, now Allardyce has the luxury of some fascinating choices at his disposal. Carroll, Diafra Sakho and Enner Valencia give him tantalising options.\n\nThey skipped back into the top four in the Premier League, maintaining their momentum despite a false start. It had not looked so promising when West Ham got caught by a precision Swansea break in the 19th minute.\n\nThe damage was created down the left as Jefferson Montero raced upfield and exchanged passes beautifully with Gylfi Sigurdsson. The Ecuadorian trickster measured his pass to Wilfried Bony, who opened up his body to guide the ball unerringly into the far corner of the goal.\n\nBony, who had been on Allardyce’s radar some years ago (he plumped for Carroll instead) continues to stake his claim as perhaps the best striker outside the Premier League’s super-rich. Just after the half-hour he bludgeoned the ball with astonishing power, having tamed it with neat control, but on this occasion his effort swerved wide.\n\nSwansea looked in the mood to be patient and wait for moments to flick into a higher gear. Montero was at the heart of it again as his pacy driving run opened the space for Sigurdsson to let fly. Adrián beat the ball away.\n\nLate in the first half West Ham began to apply some pressure of their own. Aaron Cresswell saw a header gathered by Lukasz Fabianski and, when the visitors did briefly lose their composure – their two centre-backs, Ashley Williams and Kyle Bartley, got in a muddle – Kevin Nolan’s shot ricocheted away.\n\nAllardyce’s team persevered and were rewarded when Carl Jenkinson’s cross was delivered with whip and accuracy and Carroll did what he does best. A header thumped with power and direction arced over everyone in the box and into the far corner of the net.\n\nFor all the speed and verve that has been a hallmark of West Ham’s progressive season, this was an old-fashioned goal with the signature of an old-fashioned player. It meant a lot to Carroll, who had not savoured that scoring feeling in the Premier League since March.\n\nBack came Swansea – Bony’s thunderous drive smacked the crossbar – but a couple of intense minutes midway through the second half transformed the balance of the game. Leon Britton experienced the full force of the Carroll heading machine, when he attempted to stop another effort from the big man. No chance. Frankly he was brave getting in the way of it. Carroll’s header from Stuart Downing’s corner gave West Ham the lead.\n\nAllardyce said: “Movement in the box is what it is all about, the heading in the box only comes after the movement is right and that happened with his goals. He is unstoppable when he gets that space.”\n\nTwo minutes later West Ham were buoyant and Carroll’s pearl of a ball to Sakho invited all sorts of trouble for Swansea as Fabianski rushed out to collide with the striker. Garry Monk, Swansea’s manager, was angered because Sakho used his arm to control the ball but that did not excuse Fabianski’s rush of blood five yards outside his area. The referee, Chris Foy, sent off the Polish goalkeeper.\n\nSwansea will consider an appeal. “He knocks the ball past the keeper with his hand before Fabianski makes contact,” Monk said. “Realistically it’s a handball and free-kick to us. It was not a clear goalscoring opportunity.” Allardyce disagreed, having spoken to the fourth official, Mike Dean. “He said it was a red card for denying a clear goalscoring opportunity, all day long.”\n\nIt was clear, though, that Monk’s bigger disappointment was that his team made mistakes and were not at their sharpest. Sakho was full of thrills throughout the second half. He struck the woodwork and then sealed the game with a wonderful strike that dipped wickedly and was hit with a ferocity that took the breath away. The assist? Carroll of course.\n\nMan of the match Andy Carroll (West Ham United)"}, {"date": "07/12/2014", "arena": "Villa Park", "attendance": 27692, "home_team": {"name": "Aston Villa", "lineup": [{"name": "Brad Guzan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alan Hutton", "yellows": [81], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [71], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jores Okore", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ciaran Clark", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [17], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aly Cissokho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Cleverley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [62]}, {"name": "Ashley Westwood", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [44]}, {"name": "Carlos Sánchez", "yellows": [74], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charles N'Zogbia", "yellows": [34], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [76]}, {"name": "Christian Benteke", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gabriel Agbonlahor", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Leandro Bacuna", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [76], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Herd", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kieran  Richardson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [44], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shay Given", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matthew Lowton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Callum Robinson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Grealish", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [62], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Leicester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Kasper Schmeichel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Simpson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marcin Wasilewski", "yellows": [71], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Liam Moore", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paul Konchesky", "yellows": [], "reds": [80], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Riyad Mahrez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matthew James", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Esteban Cambiasso", "yellows": [59], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jeffrey Schlupp", "yellows": [60], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [78]}, {"name": "Leonardo Ulloa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [13], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Jamie Vardy", "yellows": [41], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [66]}], "subs": [{"name": "Danny Drinkwater", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andy King", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marc Albrighton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [78], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Hamer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nick Powell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Nugent", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Wood", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [66], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "It has been a long time coming – and in more ways than one. Alan Hutton’s first goal in four years and Aston Villa’s first in the Premier League in front of the Holte End since April – a remarkable statistic – settled a tempestuous Midlands derby that saw Paul Konchesky sent off and Ashley Westwood taken off on a stretcher with a potentially serious knee injury.\n\nIt was that sort of day at Villa Park as Craig Pawson showed eight yellow cards – four for each team – and one red. Villa,on the balance of play, did enough to feel that they deserved to win a spiky encounter, though it was a mystery as to why the flashpoint with Konchesky and Hutton in the 80th minute ended with the Leicester defender being dismissed and the Villa full-back receiving only a yellow card.\n\nThe touchpaper for that incident was lit when Konchesky fouled Hutton close to the touchline. Konchesky promptly walked over to Hutton while he was on the floor and made a comment that sparked a furious reaction. Hutton jumped to his feet and the two players went nose to nose. The Villa defender then pushed Konchesky in the chest. Hutton, in other words, ended up as the aggressor and it was hard to see how Konchesky’s actions merited a tougher punishment.\n\nWhatever the rights and wrongs of that decision, Villa held on for a second win in the space of six days, elevating them to 11th in the table and lifting some of the doom and gloom that has descended on these parts. After six defeats on the spin they have now gone five games unbeaten and picked up nine points in the process – a strange season indeed.\n\nFor Leicester, the blows keep coming. It is now 10 games without a win, going back to that remarkable 5-3 triumph over Manchester United in the late September sunshine, and a winter of discontent is starting to bite. They remain anchored to the foot of the Premier League and face Manchester City next. Most frustratingly for Nigel Pearson – whose name was chanted by the travelling supporters after Leonardo Ulloa scored in the 13th minute – this was the third successive game when Leicester have taken the lead and ended up with nothing.\n\nDefending remains their achilles heel. Liam Moore switched off on Villa’s equaliser, when Ciaran Clark got away from the centre-half to head in Westwood’s floated free-kick only four minutes after Ulloa had scored, and it was alarming to see how much time and space Hutton was afforded before volleying home the winner. On a couple of other occasions Kasper Schmeichel came to Leicester’s rescue to deny Christian Benteke.\n\nAs for the fractious nature of the game, there had been a sense just before half-time that things might boil over. The tipping point was a tackle from behind by Jamie Vardy that left Westwood in a heap and Villa anxiously awaiting the result of a scan. Vardy was booked. On another day it could have been a red card. Emotions were running high and moments later Clark took ball and man in a challenge with Ulloa. It was not a foul – Pearson said afterwards that he had no complaints with Clark’s tackle – but Ulloa picked up a knee injury and failed to reappear for the second half.\n\nBenteke ought to have put Villa ahead early after the restart, when Kieran Richardson, Westwood’s replacement, set him free but Schmeichel was quickly off his line to deflect the ball behind. Leicester’s threat was sporadic, although they did come close to a second when David Nugent, on for Ulloa, struck a dipping volley from wide on the left that Guzan spectacularly tipped over.\n\nThen came Hutton’s winner. Gabriel Agbonlahor broke on the left and moved the ball on to Benteke, who spotted Hutton in space on the other side of the pitch and switched play superbly. With no Leicester defender near him Hutton, frozen out this time last year, took the ball down on his chest before beating Schmeichel at his near post. Benteke and Jack Grealish both had chances to add a third before the dust-up between Konchesky and Hutton that culminated in another name going in the book and Leicester finishing with 10 men.\n\nMan

to an end and, sure enough, Chelsea’s 23-game unbeaten run was brought to a shuddering halt by Alan Pardew’s pace-suffused counterattacking specialists. José Mourinho has never won a league match at Newcastle United and not even the enforced replacement of Pardew’s second-choice goalkeeper, Rob Elliot, with the debutant Jak Alnwick at half-time, followed by the 81st-minute dismissal of the hitherto outstanding Steven Taylor, could turn things the Chelsea manager’s way.\n\nWith his team stripped of their invincibles label Mourinho was reduced to muttering about a Tyneside time-wasting conspiracy but no one should take any notice.\n\nThis was not only Newcastle’s day but the sort of match capable of reaffirming a cynic’s faith in Premier League football. It featured Papiss Cissé stepping off the bench to score twice, Jack Colback looking England-class in the home midfield and Daryl Janmaat and Paul Dummett shining in the full-back berths. Alnwick, though, ended up eclipsing everyone courtesy of a stunning performance.\n\nWith Elliot struggling with thigh trouble, a sizeable chance finally beckoned last week. Yet if Alnwick was not entirely surprised to be called to arms, the bigger shock was that Elliot, deputising for the injured Tim Krul, never need to make a serious first-half save. Admittedly Chelsea had their moments – quite a few of them – but bar a spectacular overhead kick from Oscar that flew fractionally wide, Mourinho’s players generally huffed and puffed to little ultimate avail.\n\nGranted Chelsea struggles were of an unusually elegant, invariably exciting variety, with Eden Hazard especially hinting at trouble ahead for Newcastle but they still ended up hitting brick walls. As the minutes slipped by, Diego Costa and company found Taylor and the wonderfully assured Fabricio Coloccini a particularly obdurate central defensive barrier. Even when Cheik Tioté did his bit to help Mourinho’s cause with one horribly heavy touch and then a slide-rule pass to a slightly startled Oscar’s feet, Pardew’s defence rode to the rescue.\n\nChelsea’s growing frustration was underscored by a certain anxiety; when Mourinho’s team were not pressing and probing in the home half they invariably could be found coping with lightning counterattacks.\n\nIf the cameo when Taylor decided to treat everyone to his Franz Beckenbauer impression, exchanging passes with Sammy Ameobi as he surged towards the visiting penalty area was never going to end in a goal, Colback could have scored a couple. Taking a break from disrupting Chelsea’s passing rhythm, the former Sunderland midfielder burst late into the area, met Ayoze Pérez’s clever delivery and forced the advancing Thibault Courtois into a good save as he attempted to chip him. A little later, Colback shot narrowly wide.\n\nWhile Chelsea were sporadically ruffled by Moussa Sissoko’s advances, Pérez’s counterattacking pace threatened to undo them. Receiving the ball on the halfway line, the young Spaniard drew Gary Cahill into a challenge before dodging the centre-half’s lunge and leaving Cahill a fast receding speck in his rear-view mirror. Mourinho had plenty to ponder but with Elliot limping off at the interval but the Portuguese could surely not have envisaged that Pardew would shortly be punching thin air with joy.\n\nCissé had only just replaced Rémy Cabella when Ameobi crossed from the left, Cahill mis-kicked and, from six yards, shot unerringly beyond Courtois.\n\nHazard subsequently hit a post from around 12 yards but as Chelsea’s chased an equaliser another Newcastle counterattack resulted in a goal. This time Colback’s superlative pass picked out Sissoko down the left. The France midfielder shaped to shoot but, crowded by defenders, the ball seemed to become tangled in his feet and he ended up somehow hooking it in Cissé’s direction.\n\nWith a host of markers distracted and Courtois by now off his line, the Senegal striker took full advantage, whipping the ball into the empty net.\n\nMourinho shook his head, repeatedly, a disbelieving smile playing across his face. It became considerably broader when Taylor, already booked for a silly foul on Willian, received a second yellow card for flying in late on Andre Schürrle. Off he trudged, with only himself to blame for spoiling an otherwise stellar display.\n\nBy then Didier Drogba was on as a substitute and, as he emphasised when heading Cesc Fàbregas’s free-kick past Alnwick, making quite an impact. The Ivorian’s introduction coincided with Mourinho ordering a switch to direct tactics and, aided by a somewhat astonishing six minutes of stoppage time, Chelsea launched an attacking blitz.\n\nCommendably Alnwick held firm, dealing brilliantly with a barrage of high balls and crosses while also performing wonders to tip Costa’s drive over the bar and parry Filipe Luís’s long-range shot.\n\nTuesday marks the fourth anniversary of Pardew’s installation as Newcastle’s manager; it promises to be a very happy occasion."}, {"date": "06/12/2014", "arena": "KCOM Stadium", "attendance":

out of his squad for the Premier League draw with West Brom.\n\nThe Hull manager hauled Ben Arfa off after just 35 minutes of last week’s 3-0 defeat at Manchester United and also left him out for the midweek draw at Everton.\n\nBut despite accusing Ben Arfa of “not hurting enough” during the Old Trafford defeat, Bruce insisted he is yet to make a decision on whether to extend his loan spell from Newcastle, which is due to run out in January.\n\nBruce said: “There’s no bust-up – of course he’s not happy about being taken off but he’s got to be treated like everyone else and win his spurs back by trying hard and getting back in the team.\n\n“He didn’t hurt enough at Old Trafford to be among the substitutes at Goodison Park or today. His attitude is okay and I haven’t got any problems with his personality, but he simply has to roll his sleeves up and work for the cause.\n\n“There is no disputing he has got ability but ability is not enough at this level so he will be treated like everyone else. We will see what December and January brings and I will sit down with him and see where we are.”\n\nBruce admitted his side had endured another frustrating afternoon which, but for the heroics of his goalkeeper Allan McGregor, could have been worse.\n\nMcGregor saved a ninth-minute penalty from Graham Dorrans and pulled off a superb stop from Craig Gardner’s second half free-kick.\n\nBruce added: “I’m still convinced we’ve got enough in the squad to be better than we were last season and we have got enough to see us through.”\n\nThe West Brom manager, Alan Irvine, stood by his decision to drop Saido Berahino to the bench and said he hoped the striker would come back stronger from his recent lean spell. He said: “Saido is a young player and we have asked an awful lot of him this year. He has done really well overall but everyone could see in recent weeks things had gone off for him and he was struggling to find the form he’d had at the start of the season.\n\n“I made the decision to take him out of the firing line to give him a bit of a breather and take a little bit of that pressure off him.\n\n“Hopefully it will be good for him and he will respond.

The worry for Brendan Rodgers is that the teenager rampaged alone. Poyet’s demeaning accusation still stands.\n\nLiverpool received a painful reminder of the lengths they still have to travel as they became the ninth team to be held to a stalemate by Sunderland this season. Rodgers claimed, before kick-off, that the mood around Anfield had been transformed by two consecutive league victories, but form is not conjured up overnight. His team are approaching a defining period still searching for fluency, invention and someone other than Sterling to shoulder responsibility whenever Steven Gerrard is rested. There was nothing to trouble the observers from Basel here, apart from boredom.\n\nIt demonstrates the extent of Rodgers’ dilemma over his captain that Sterling – and only Sterling – provided Liverpool’s best hope and one constant source of quality until being accompanied on the pitch by Gerrard in the 67th minute.\n\nToo many others clung to the margins of a contest devoid of incident. Costel Pantilimon saved from Philippe Coutinho at the end of a flowing Sterling run; both sides had half-hearted penalty appeals waved away; and Poyet again rued the absence of a quality forward to make the difference on mundane afternoons. Rodgers was also on familiar ground after the final whistle, defending the legitimate decision to leave Gerrard out of his starting lineup ahead of crucial games against Basel in the Champions League and Manchester United in the Premier League, but wondering when Liverpool’s next leaders are going to reveal themselves.\n\n“The management of Steven is fine and we can’t solely rely on him,” said the Liverpool manager. “His talent is world class, but the contribution has to come throughout the team. It can’t be up to him every single game to be the catalyst, and he’ll start on Tuesday.\n\n“Our intention was to win the game. The first half was slow in intensity, the second half was much better, but the ball wouldn’t drop to us. It was important we kept a clean sheet and that is seven points from nine this week.\n\nI thought Raheem was fantastic. His threat was incredible and, when Steven came on, it gave the team the world-class quality it needs.” But it was not enough.\n\nThere were glimpses of last season’s intuitive understanding between Coutinho and Sterling in Liverpool’s approach work, Glen Johnson provided a constant outlet down the right, but the wise old heads of John O’Shea and Wes Brown were alert to everything that came their way in the centre of Sunderland’s defence.\n\nConnor Wickham had two hopeful penalty appeals dismissed by the referee, Neil Swarbrick – the first, a collision with Martin Skrtel in Sunderland’s opening attack, more convincing than a later tumble under Adam Lallana. Sterling also had a late claim for a spot-kick denied after a challenge by Anthony Réveillère.\n\nSunderland’s midfield trio of Sebastian Larsson, Liam Bridcutt and Jordi Gómez frequently passed their way around Liverpool’s exposed centre to give Poyet’s side a surprising level of control, but Jozy Altidore and Wickham rarely made their presence felt.\n\nThe chances that did fall Sunderland’s way were squandered carelessly. Brown headed Adam Johnson’s inviting corner high into the Kop with the final touch of the opening half.\n\nAt the start of the second, from another Johnson corner that skimmed off the head of Skrtel, Wickham arrived unmarked at the back post, but blazed a volley across and wide of Simon Mignolet’s goal.

Too many grounds are mega-bowls with neither identity nor soul but Queens Park Rangers’ home is different. The floodlights poke out above terraced houses, leg room is out of the question, the crowd is small and there is barely a seat in the house where the view is not restricted in some way. But that is what gives it its charm and when QPR are winning, it can be a struggle to hear yourself think.\n\nIf QPR could play at Loftus Road every week, they would not be fighting for survival. As brittle as they have been on their travels, failing to pick up a single point in seven away matches, there is something about the Shepherd’s Bush air that makes confidence flow through Harry Redknapp’s side and this victory over Burnley, secured by goals from Leroy Fer and Charlie Austin, lifted them out of the bottom three for the first time since August.\n\nIt was not always convincing and it came at a cost.\n\nQPR lost Austin to a late red card after he received a second booking for catching Michael Keane with an elbow and they will miss their leading scorer at Everton next week, while Burnley justifiably felt that they were the superior side.\n\nBurnley exposed QPR’s defence on enough occasions for them to be aggrieved in defeat, yet Sean Dyche was frustrated by the wastefulness of his team’s finishing. “We need to be more clinical,” Dyche said. “That’s the league we’re in, it’s very unforgiving.”\n\nQPR knew that Burnley ran them close. There was a mood of expectation about the home fans before kick-off, but that can be a dangerous thing for a side in QPR’s position and the positive mood soon gave way to howls of disapproval as Burnley, eager and adventurous, took control of the first half.\n\nBurnley’s football was slick at times and there was a frail look to the QPR defence.\n\nThey were fortunate not to fall behind when Robert Green came for a cross and bumped into Mauricio Isla, but the QPR goalkeeper redeemed himself by diverting Scott Arfield’s volley wide. George Boyd and Ashley Barnes were also wayward from promising positions.\n\nWhile Burnley’s forwards were let down by their profligacy, QPR’s were suffering a system malfunction. They kept getting their wires crossed, through-balls sent into the wrong areas and crosses drifting out of play, and Austin was quiet against his old club.\n\nYet QPR almost took the lead with their first cohesive attack, Eduardo Vargas cutting inside from the right and taking aim for the far post. The ball squirmed past Tom Heaton but Kieran Trippier cleared it off the line.\n\nHowever, Green was the busier goalkeeper and he produced what Dyche called a “worldie” save when Boyd let fly with his left foot from 25 yards. “I was right behind it, that was top corner all the way,” Redknapp said. Boyd was getting ready to celebrate but Green threw himself to his left and tipped the ball on to the left post.\n\nAlthough Dyche was pleased with Burnley’s endeavour, they had nothing to show for their dominance and anyone with a passing acquaintance with footballing logic knew what was coming next. During the break, Redknapp told his players that they would lose if there was no improvement in the second half. They emerged with renewed purpose, started to win their tackles and opened the scoring in the 51st minute.\n\nIt was a fine goal. Bobby Zamora popped up on the left and released Austin with an intelligent pass. He slipped it inside to Fer and his shot from six yards out looped off Mee, over Heaton and into the net.\n\nBack came Burnley. Richard Dunne denied them with crucial interventions and Danny Ings and Boyd were unable to extend Green after good work from Trippier on the right. They were bad misses.\n\nIt was left to Austin to show his former team-mates how to finish after a move that owed everything to QPR’s Chilean connection on the right. When Vargas played a lovely one-two with Isla and cut a cross back from the byline, Austin did the rest, sweeping his eighth goal of the season past Heaton.\n\nQPR thought they could relax but anxiety set in when Jon Moss sent off Austin two minutes later. Burnley had enough time to force their way back into the match but they were not ruthless enough to take advantage."}, {"date": "06/12/2014", "arena": "Bet365 Stadium", "attendance": 27367, "home_team": {"name": "Stoke City", "lineup": [{"name": "Asmir Begovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Bardsley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Shawcross", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marc Muniesa", "yellows": [44], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [63]}, {"name": "Erik Pieters", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven N'Zonzi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Geoff Cameron", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jon Walters", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [45], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bojan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [35], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [87]}, {"name": "Mame Biram Diouf", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [69]}, {"name": "Peter Crouch", "yellows": [46], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [1], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Robert Huth", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [87], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Glenn Whelan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [63], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stephen Ireland", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charlie Adam", "yellows": [84], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [69], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Butland", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Oussama Assaidi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Oliver Shenton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Arsenal", "lineup": [{"name": "Emiliano Martinez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Hector Bellerin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Calum Chambers", "yellows": [61], "reds": [78], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Per Mertesacker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kieran Gibbs", "yellows": [71], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Mathieu Flamini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Ramsey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [70], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain", "yellows": [72], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Santi Cazorla", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [68], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alexis Sánchez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Olivier Giroud", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [63]}], "subs": [{"name": "Wojciech Szczesny", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Laurent Koscielny", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lukas Podolski", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [63], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Welbeck", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joel Campbell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Semi Ajayi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ainsley Maitland-Niles", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "The most damning thing is that Arsenal did not seem to know what had hit them. On a venture into a cauldron with which they are grimly familiar, against opponents who relish hosting them and on a day when Chelsea’s defeat at Newcastle had reignited the faint possibility of them rejoining the title race, Arsène Wenger’s team made a feeble start from which they never recovered.\n\nArsenal fleetingly threatened to mount a creditable comeback but ultimately finished with 10 men, as Calum Chambers was harshly sent off, and no points, which was all they deserved. Stoke were full value for their victory.\n\nMatches between these clubs have been shrouded in a singular atmosphere in recent seasons, part culture clash, part blood feud. Much of the ill feeling dates back to the shattering injury that Aaron Ramsey suffered following a challenge by Ryan Shawcross here four years ago. Paradoxically, that harrowing match was the last one that Arsenal have won here. Stoke may have evolved beyond the direct style that once led Wenger to dismiss them as a rugby team during the Tony Pulis regime, but under Mark Hughes they have continued to unsettle Arsenal.\n\nWenger would surely have wanted to deploy a full-strength side here but the fact that injuries to Laurent Koscielny and Nacho Monreal meant that he had to deploy a back four that included a pair of inexperienced 19-year-olds highlighted why Arsenal fans have long complained that he has bought insufficient cover in that area. Arsenal should still have had the wherewithal to cope much better with the challenge ahead. Having been so amply forewarned, there is no excuse for how shocked they looked from the start.\n\nIt took Stoke 18 seconds to expose Arsenal’s fragility. Chambers seemed to shrink under a cross from Steven Nzonzi and the ball dropped in the six-yard box. As Héctor Bellerín floundered, Mame Biram Diouf helped it on to Peter Crouch, who stroked it past Emiliano Martínez from close range. Cue that familiar gloating refrain from Stoke fans when Arsenal are in town: “Swing Low, Sweet Chariot,” they crooned.\n\nStoke remained stronger and sharper than the visitors throughout the first period but also more coherent. Arsenal should, however, have equalised in the 11th minute when Bellerín raced down the right and picked out Olivier Giroud with a sweet cross. The Frenchman headed wide from five yards. That was no way to go about vindicating Wenger’s decision to start him ahead of Danny Welbeck.\n\nAt the other end Martínez was looking jittery, fumbling a long-range shot from Phil Bardsley in the 18th minute. It was symptomatic of the first half that Stoke’s wonder waif, Bojan Krkic, harassed Cazorla into coughing up possession on halfway in the 25th minute before out-fighting Per Mertesacker to set up a Stoke attack that culminated in a dangerous corner. When Krkic is bullying your team, it is difficult to fend off accusations of mental weakness. Krkic ghosted past Arsenal defenders in the 34th minute to slam a cross from Jonathan Walters into the net.\n\nAlex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Alexis Sánchez made sporadic bursts forward for Arsenal but their ad hoc incursions did not yield shooting opportunities, underlining how fragmented Arsenal seemed. The visiting manager sat seething in his dugout.\n\n“Arsène Wenger, he’s scared to stand up,” taunted the home fans. Wenger later explained that the reason he remained seated throughout the match was that “they love me so much here that I didn’t want to give them an opportunity to show their love for me”. Understandable, but the sight of Wenger hiding from opposing fans offered an eloquent metaphor for his player’s performance.\n\nArsenal wilted again under the challenge of a corner just before half-time, Crouch nodding it on before Walters rocketed the ball into the roof of the net from three yards to make it 3-0.\n\nWenger replaced Bellerín with Welbeck for the second half and that change helped trigger an improvement, the England striker sending a deflected effort off target just after the break.\n\nStoke kept Sánchez mostly subdued until the 57th minute, when the South American embarked on a dribble of which Diego Maradona would have been proud. But after rounding the goalkeeper Sánchez shot against the post. Then Krkic did better and seemingly put the result beyond doubt.\n\nAfter darting in from the left the forward fired a low shot past Martínez at the near post to crown a superb personal performance. But his effort was disallowed.\n\nArsenal badly needed a break and they got one in the 68th minute when Diouf shunted over Mathieu Flamini in the box to concede a penalty which Cazorla converted. Fresh belief flowed through Arsenal, even more so two minutes later when Ramsey scored with a spanking volley.\n\nIn the 78th minute another Krkic-led attack was ended illegally by Chambers, who thus earned his second yellow card. Arsenal were now a man down as well as a goal down, with 12 minutes to go. They fought hard for an equaliser but their efforts proved too little, too late."}, {"date": "06/12/2014", "arena": "White Hart Lane", "attendance": 35860, "home_team": {"name": "Tottenham Hotspur", "lineup": [{"name": "Hugo Lloris", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eric Dier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Federico Fazio", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jan Vertonghen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Davies", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Mason", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [66]}, {"name": "Nabil Bentaleb", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Erik Lamela", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Harry Kane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Eriksen", "yellows": [88], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Roberto Soldado", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [83]}], "subs": [{"name": "Danny Rose", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Younes Kaboul", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Lennon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [83], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paulinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [66], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michel Vorm", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nacer Chadli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Benjamin Stambouli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Crystal Palace", "lineup": [{"name": "Julian Speroni", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Kelly", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Scott Dann", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Brede Hangeland", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joel Ward", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mile Jedinak", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wilfried Zaha", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [66]}, {"name": "James McArthur", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Ledley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yannick Bolasie", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marouane Chamakh", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Fraizer Campbell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wayne Hennessey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jerome Thomas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dwight Gayle", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Barry Bannan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Damien Delaney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jason Puncheon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [66], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "The person whose job it was to operate the big screen at White Hart Lane was busy here. On three occasions in the first half, he or she pressed the button to roll out the latest scores from elsewhere and, wouldn’t you know it, the updates came after each of Stoke City’s goals against Arsenal.\n\nThe situation became even more laughable when Bojan Krkic thought he had put Stoke 4-0 up in the second half. Almost immediately, Stoke 4-0 Arsenal scrolled along the bottom of the screen, to great cheers from the home support. The only trouble was that the goal was disallowed. There was no subsequent correction, nor any mention of the Arsenal goals that followed.\n\nThe reason for mentioning all of this was that there was precious little for Tottenham fans to cheer about their own team’s performance. They failed to extend the Crystal Palace goalkeeper, Julián Speroni, and the feelgood factor of the previous game here, when Everton were beaten after a high-tempo display, felt like a distant memory. It was all desperately ponderous and the scale of the challenge that Mauricio Pochettino faces to revive this club remains clear.\n\nPalace deserved to win, and they would have done but for Hugo Lloris, who made wonderful saves to deny Scott Dann and Yannick Bolasie. The substitute Jason Puncheon rattled the crossbar and the visitors created other, presentable opportunities, particularly for Joe Ledley. There was a cut and thrust about Palace, to go with their commitment and organisation, and Neil Warnock described the performance as the “most complete” of the season.\n\nHe singled out everybody for praise afterwards, apart from Speroni, because he was such a peripheral figure, and the manager gave special mention to the centre-forward, Marouane Chamakh, who he felt had typified Palace’s industry. Most observers had the wingers, Bolasie, Wilfried Zaha and Puncheon, down as the star turns, with each of them providing moments to draw the breath. It spoke volumes that Warnock could be disappointed with the point.\n\n“The game was there to be won,” he said. “It’s so frustrating. I also said that if they didn’t get a result today, they could not go on their Christmas party. I have allowed the party to go ahead.”\n\nPalace’s players could enjoy their night out but for Tottenham there was a return to the familiar pursuit of soul-searching. It was an afternoon when they had to assert themselves, both mentally and physically, and they failed. It has become a recurring problem at their own stadium against opponents that sit further down the division. The flaw in their mentality is stark.\n\nPochettino complained about his players’ “lack of freshness”, possibly as a result of having played three times in seven days and he voiced his unhappiness at the collective display, although he had to admit that it could have been worse. “Yes,” the manager said. “Lloris made two big saves.” Pochettino was also narked to be asked about Emmanuel Adebayor, who was missing once again because of illness. “I answered that in my press conference on Friday,” he said.\n\nPalace called the tune at the outset, with Bolasie tormenting the Tottenham right-back, Eric Dier. He wowed the crowd when he pirouetted, flicked the ball up, span and raced away from Christian Eriksen in one fluid movement. From the subsequent cut-back, Ledley shot high.\n\nBy then, Ryan Mason had almost headed into his own net following a Palace corner while, on 27 minutes, Dann headed goalwards only for Lloris to thwart him at full stretch. There was also the flash from Zaha when he blitzed past Dier in a blur of quick feet and curled wide of the far post.\n\nTottenham laboured, with Erik Lamela enduring a personal nightmare and being withdrawn at half-time.

Suspected ligament damage will almost certainly rule him out of the crucial Champions League fixture in Rome on Wednesday, and City will hope his absence is not a prolonged one, for they are not the same team without him.\n\nManuel Pellegrini paid tribute beforehand to Agüero’s considerable contribution to his side’s 10 goals and nine points from their last three games, but emphasised that City are not a one-man team. That claim was quickly put to the test here when City’s leading scorer had to hobble off, wiping away tears of either pain or frustration after he twisted his knee in falling following a challenge from Séamus Coleman.\n\nPellegrini had Edin Dzeko on the bench but decided against using him, unsure if he could complete a full game after his own return from injury. Instead he opted for the 18-year-old Spanish striker José Pozo, who made his league debut only last week against Sunderland.\n\nEliaquim Mangala was correctly booked once the game restarted for an outrageous foul on Samuel Eto’o in the Everton penalty area as the Cameroonian came back to defend a corner. After leaping for a header and planting an outstretched boot into the small of Eto’o’s back Mangala could consider himself lucky to stay on the field, but none of the officials had a clear view of the incident and might not even have detected it had not Eto’o stayed on the ground.\n\nCity were doing most of the pressing, and took the lead midway through the first half when Phil Jagielka conceded a penalty, attempting a tackle on James Milner but ending up going through him from behind without getting any of the ball. At least that is what the referee decided. Whether Milner was going anywhere with the ball after his last touch is another matter, and Roberto Martínez was not even sure a foul had been committed. “All the contact was above the waist,” the Everton manager said. “Shoulder to shoulder is part of the game and Milner’s reaction said everything, he just got up to carry on playing.”\n\nYaya Touré stepped up to beat Tim Howard with a low shot to the goalkeeper’s right, then the next controversy of what was proving an eventful first half arrived when Fernando’s boot made contact with Gareth Barry’s face. It was probably accidental, Fernando was going for a high ball and may not have realised Barry was directly behind him, but he received a booking anyway for having his foot raised so high.\n\nKevin Mirallas saw a shot deflected narrowly wide before the interval but Everton were not creating many chances or showing their usual conviction when behind. Romelu Lukaku was a peripheral figure for the most part as City denied Everton their usual attacking avenues down the flanks, and Eto’o too was hardly in the game. Mirallas was the visitors’ most dangerous attacking player, but only because he was doing most of the work himself, drifting inside to pick up the ball then running with directness at the City defence. The home side perhaps ought to have been further ahead by half-time, though in truth they were not so sparkling either. Milner was a success on the left wing but without Agüero their attack lacked a spearhead and in midfield Touré was too often guilty of giving the ball away.\n\nCity opened the second half with more determination and Pozo might have had a first league goal but for a save by Howard four minutes in. Milner made a strong break down the left and crossed low, Pozo met it in the area and did everything right, but though Howard was initially moving the wrong way he managed to scramble a low shot away with his feet.\n\nThe teenager was left to rue Howard’s reactions, for he was hauled off a few minutes later in favour of Dzeko, having contributed enough to merit a warm round of applause from the crowd.\n\nEverton sent on Ross Barkley around the same time in an attempt to boost their attacking potency and salvage something from the game, though in withdrawing the neat and industrious Muhamed Besic they risked leaving themselves more open in defence.\n\nFor a while it looked as though Martínez’s gamble might pay off as Everton enjoyed a brief period in the ascendancy midway through the second half, though all it actually amounted to was a shot from Eto’o that flew miles too high.\n\nCity immediately did better as soon as Frank Lampard joined the fray, Dzeko knocking the substitute’s diagonal ball into the path of Milner, who deserved a goal but missed the target from near the penalty spot. Finally, as the game entered its last 10 minutes, Lukaku exploded into action for Everton, fastening on to Eto’o’s flick and forcing a fine one-handed reaction save from Joe Hart. That could have been the moment Everton snatched a point, but Hart rose to the occasion, despite being under-occupied for most of the game.\n\nWhile never at their most fluent, City hung on for a narrow victory. They will be anxious to have Agüero back, although David Silva is believed to be ready to return soon. “I will not complain about injuries because we have a squad large enough to cope,” Pellegrini said. “The main thing today was we got the result we needed to get nearer to Chelsea.”"}, {"date": "03/12/2014", "arena": "Emirates Stadium", "attendance": 60025, "home_team": {"name": "Arsenal", "lineup": [{"name": "Emiliano Martinez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Calum Chambers", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Per Mertesacker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Laurent Koscielny", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nacho Monreal", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Ramsey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mathieu Flamini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [65]}, {"name": "Santi Cazorla", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alexis Sánchez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [89], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Welbeck", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [81]}], "subs": [{"name": "Kieran Gibbs", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tomas Rosicky", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lukas Podolski", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [81], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Olivier Giroud", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [65], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yaya Sanogo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Hector Bellerin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matt Macey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Southampton", "lineup": [{"name": "Fraser Forster", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathaniel Clyne", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "José Fonte", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Toby Alderweireld", "yellows": [43], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Bertrand", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Davis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Wanyama", "yellows": [76], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Cork", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [29]}, {"name": "Shane Long", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [81]}, {"name": "Graziano Pellè", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dusan Tadic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [62]}], "subs": [{"name": "Kelvin Davis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Maya Yoshida", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [29], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Florin Gardos", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sadio Mané", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [62], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Emmanuel Mayuka", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [81], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harrison Reed", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matt Targett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Arsenal have their momentum. This had been billed as the night when they would build on the encouraging wins over Borussia Dortmund and West Bromwich Albion, in which they had kept clean sheets but, for so long, it looked as if they would get only one part of the equation right.\n\nSouthampton were well-drilled, tidy in possession and they flickered on the counter. For 70 minutes the visitors were the better team and the crowd bubbled with frustration. Too much of Arsenal’s passing was off-kilter.\n\nArsène Wenger’s decision to substitute Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, who had been just about the pick of the home team’s attacking players, was greeted by boos and it seemed like an illustration of how fragile the mood can be in these parts. Wenger spoke afterwards of how the crowd’s nerves had been transmitted to the players.\n\nThe man who replaced Oxlade-Chamberlain made the difference. Olivier Giroud showcased his physical strength, touch and eye for goal, bringing one particularly outstanding save from the impressive Fraser Forster.\n\nBut Southampton’s resistance broke after the cruellest of mishaps. Ronald Koeman had used his three substitutes – the first two after injuries to Jack Cork and Dusan Tadic following late tackles from Aaron Ramsey and Santi Cazorla respectively – when Toby Alderweireld felt a hamstring twang on 84 minutes. He had to go off, leaving Southampton to try to cling on with 10 men.\n\nThey could not do so. After Forster’s world-class, one-handed save from Giroud’s header, Arsenal sensed the decisive moment was close and it came after José Fonte appeared to have handled inside the area under pressure from Giroud.\n\nThe referee, Andre Marriner, who was officiating his first Arsenal game since he mistakenly sent off Kieran Gibbs at Chelsea last March, was not swayed and it was left to Ramsey to recycle the move to the right of goal.\n\nSouthampton crowded three men towards him but he fashioned a low cut-back and there was Alexis Sánchez, timing his arrival in predatory fashion, to guide a low shot home from close range. Wenger said Sánchez was one of the players who had needed to dig deep into his reserves of stamina but the Chilean has shown his fighting qualities on numerous occasions. It was his 14th goal for the club and, remarkably, the eighth time he has scored at 0-0. Southampton were crushed.\n\nKoeman made the point that it was hard enough with 11 men at the Emirates and he felt that Alderweireld’s injury had given Arsenal “a step back into the game”. He did not complain about the tackles on Cork and Tadic – kicks can happen – but he voiced his frustration at how the relentless schedule in English football was placing too great a strain on clubs such as Southampton. This was the reason why Alderweireld’s hamstring had buckled.\n\nMemo to Ronald: it is only going to get worse over Christmas. He suggested that he may have to move for reinforcements in January.\n\nSouthampton have lost to Liverpool, Tottenham Hotspur, Manchester City and Arsenal but, until Giroud’s introduction, they had looked set to enjoy some reward. Their football at the outset was balanced and easy on the eye, and Graziano Pellè should have scored after a neat interchange with Steven Davis. The finish was wild. Koeman would also point to Shane Long’s chance on the break in the 52nd minute. He ought to have crossed for Pellè in front of goal rather than shoot.\n\nArsenal had offered little apart from Danny Welbeck’s glancing header in first-half injury-time from Cazorla’s free-kick which Forster tipped over in spectacular fashion, but Giroud stirred them.\n\nWith virtually his first touch on 70 minutes he clubbed a shot from a tight angle that Forster beat clear and moments later his flick set Welbeck clear. Forster made another fine save.\n\nArsenal came on strong in the end and, after the goal, Forster denied Ramsey and Sánchez might have had a penalty for the substitute Maya Yoshida’s challenge. Wenger made the valid point that his team had created the better chances and he praised them for showing patience. “There was not our usual fluency,” he added. “But it’s important to win when it’s not perfect.”"}, {"date": "03/12/2014", "arena": "Stamford Bridge", "attendance": 41518, "home_team": {"name": "Chelsea", "lineup": [{"name": "Thibaut Courtois", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals":

into context is that the last time they won at Stamford Bridge was the same day President FW de Klerk announced Nelson Mandela was to be released from prison.\n\nIt is 24 years and 10 months since a side managed by Terry Venables came away with a 2-1 victory and their latest defeat was their 28th attempt to break that run.\n\nMauricio Pochettino is the 15th manager to give it a go and, once again, all Spurs were left with was the now-familiar sense of deja vu that engulfs this rivalry.\n\nThis one was classic Tottenham in many ways: starting encouragingly, threatening sporadically to create a story but then playing a considerable part in their own downfall and reminding us of the gulf that exists between a side with authentic title aspirations and one in a game of catch-up.\n\nChelsea did not play as exhilaratingly as the scoreline suggests but they were the more ruthless, efficient team by some considerable distance and there was an air of inevitability about this win as soon as Eden Hazard and Didier Drogba had scored within three minutes of one another midway through the first half.\n\nLoïc Rémy, a second-half substitute, added a stylish third shortly after replacing Drogba and the Premier League leaders, maintaining their six-point advantage over Manchester City, have equalled their record of 23 successive matches unbeaten, set previously in 2007 and 2009.\n\nChelsea’s manager, José Mourinho, acclaimed Drogba, who is three months short of his 37th birthday, as “remarkable” and the only downside for Chelsea came in the form of the yellow card that means Nemanja Matic will be suspended from Saturday’s game at Newcastle.\n\nYet Chelsea, lest it be forgotten, were without Diego Costa, serving his own ban, for their latest victory which came with a haughty shrug from Mourinho.\n\n“No problem,” he said. “Did you remember Diego Costa today? I didn’t. We give confidence to the other people. We don’t cry when somebody cannot play. Diego Costa is already rested and now Nemanja Matic will be rested. No problem.”\n\nTottenham had actually begun the game as though affronted by the statistics and, as Mourinho volunteered, they “were better than us in the first 20 minutes”. They passed the ball crisply and had a striker, in Harry Kane, who looked capable of troubling Chelsea’s back four.\n\nYet Spurs cannot expect to defend this generously and get away with it against the side at the top of the league.\n\nKane could not make the most of either of the two chances that fell for him inside the opening quarter of an hour and it was startling to see the way Spurs crumpled during that period when the game suddenly lurched away from them.\n\nDrogba’s goal was a particularly traumatic one for Spurs to concede given that it came from nothing more elaborate than Hugo Lloris miscuing a routine kick, not even getting the ball to the midway point of his own half and leaving himself hopelessly exposed as Oscar and Hazard set up the man filling in for Costa.\n\nDrogba might not be the player he once was but this was a gift and Lloris took a long time to shake his head clear. There were three other occasions in the first half when he shanked or misplaced clearances from his own penalty area.\n\nPochettino reflected afterwards about the moment early on when Kane sent a twisting header against the crossbar and, shortly afterwards, when the same player seized on a mistake by the Chelsea and England defender Gary Cahill, drove into the penalty area and flashed a shot across the goalmouth. “The first chance Chelsea created, they scored; the second, they scored again,” the Spurs manager said. “We need to be more clinical because that was the difference.”\n\nWhat he did not dwell on was the level of self-inflicted damage.\n\nHazard’s speed and movement makes him a dangerously elusive player but there was nothing particularly original about the one-two with Drogba that created the opening goal.\n\nThe problem for Tottenham was that Aaron Lennon had let his man run off him. Vlad Chiriches was out of position and Hazard picked his spot to change the entire complexion of the night.\n\nCahill’s error might have had something to do with a clash of heads with the Tottenham centre-half Jan Vertonghen in the opening five minutes, leading to the Chelsea centre-half being replaced by Kurt Zouma at half-time.\n\nKane continued to toil away but there was also the clear sense that the home side were playing within themselves, content to protect their lead and operate from a position of strength.\n\nIt was risk-free football from Mourinho’s team in the second half, with Matic and Cesc Fàbregas rarely straying too far forwards until Rémy’s goal settled any lingering nerves, when he ran on to César Azpilicueta’s pass and got the better of Vertonghen inside the penalty area.\n\nWillian was available to his right but Rémy expertly guided the ball past Lloris and the Chelsea machine rolled on."}, {"date": "03/12/2014", "arena": "Goodison Park", "attendance": 34645,

They have witnessed two wins in seven Premier League home games this season and more lethargic, defensively weak, performances than a club with Champions League aspirations can afford. Hull City, third from bottom at the start of play, were grateful beneficiaries of the latest flat production.\n\nRoberto Martínez described the boos that rang out on the final whistle as symptomatic of the frustration that comes with “having three points in the bag and ending up with only one”. That might have been the optimistic outlook at half-time, when Everton had recovered from a sluggish start to lead through Romelu Lukaku’s sixth league goal of the season, but it was redundant by full-time. Hull were full value for Sone Aluko’s equaliser and were inches away from victory when Nikica Jelavic’s header landed the wrong side of a post. The condemnation was for the Everton performance.\n\nThe visitors made the brighter, more purposeful start to both halves and Everton’s impressive response midway through the opening period was the only time Martínez’s team were on top. They were otherwise laboured, lacking ideas and energy. “We were fantastic in the first half,” the Blues manager said. “We got through the lines really well and had good tempo in our passing. The second half was completely different. It is a difficult moment in the season to find energy. Leighton Baines went off with a bloody nose, our rhythm was unsettled, Hull had one shot on target and equalised. We couldn’t find any energy after that.”\n\nMartínez claims to be unperturbed by Everton’s home form and continues to insist the key is being in contention for the final third of the season. Heavy legs in early December do not bode well.\n\nSteve Bruce, in stark contrast, could take justifiable pleasure in his team’s point. Hull’s run is now one win in 13 matches but having fallen to a meek defeat at Manchester United on Saturday, prompting him to drop the captain, Curtis Davies, and recall three players essential to promotion from the Championship in 2013 – Liam Rosenior, David Meyler and Stephen Quinn – their reaction and intent was impressive. “We have been up against it and so I wanted to make sure we had honesty and endeavour in our play and we got it,” said Bruce. “If there was one team that was going to win it in the second half, it was us.”\n\nEverton took the lead after Lukaku flicked Phil Jagielka’s long ball on to the impressive Kevin Mirallas, who evaded Michael Dawson too easily down the right and returned a measured pass into the path of his Belgian compatriot. Lukaku’s finish was swift and emphatic beyond the exposed Allan McGregor.\n\nThey had opportunities to extend their advantage before the interval but precious few afterwards. Hull’s determined start to the second half was aided and abetted by clumsy defending. Aluko had been on the field for only six minutes when he exchanged passes with Jelavic, evaded a weak challenge from Sylvain Distin and threaded a simple finish inside Tim Howard’s near post. An emphatic introduction from the substitute but a dreadful goal for players of the experience of Howard and Distin to concede."}, {"date": "03/12/2014", "arena": "Stadium of Light", "attendance":

the notion that Manuel Pellegrini might be under some sort of pressure at the Etihad Stadium.\n\nWith Sergio Agüero at his ruthless best and Yaya Touré further deconstructing theories that he could be a fading force, Manchester City were irresistible.\n\nAt times their football, frequently fast and one-touch, was so mesmerising they threatened to pass Gus Poyet’s team off the pitch but the worrying thing for future opponents is that Sunderland scored first and were far from meek.\n\nChelsea may hold a six-point lead at the top of the table but, on this utterly compelling evidence, Jose Mourinho has absolutely no cause for complacency. “You can’t be champions in December,” said Pellegrini. “We’ve got six months more to try to be champions again but I don’t think it will be just two teams fighting for the title, there’ll be three or four. Manchester United have won their last four games and Arsenal are coming again.”\n\nCity, though, hold an ace card in Agüero, who has scored 19 goals in 20 appearances this term. “I don’t know if there’s a better striker in Europe,” the manager said. “In his last few games I think he’s shown he’s one of the best five players in the world. It’s not just that he’s scoring, he’s playing very well generally. And we’re returning to our best form, there’s trust in the team, it’s different now.”\n\nPoyet – still to name the same starting XI in successive games this season – changed the formula which secured a fine point against Chelsea last Saturday. Sunderland’s manager aimed to confuse City by shaking things up. Where his team had been content to sit deep against Mourinho’s players, they attempted to impose themselves, holding a high defensive line as, initially at least, they endeavoured to press Pellegrini’s side.\n\nIf this strategy produced mixed results, the switching of Connor Wickham from the left to right flank and the replacement of the injured Adam Johnson with Will Buckley briefly, deceptively, seemed to ruffle the visiting defence.\n\nAnd after Pablo Zabaleta blocked a shot from his former team-mate Jack Rodwell following Buckley’s deceiving early cross, Wickham opened the scoring. Sebastian Larsson’s reverse pass created the goal, which was tinged with fortune as Wickham benefited from the ball ricocheting back on to him after an attempted tackle. The ball flicked off the striker and arced impressively over Joe Hart like the cleverest chip.\n\nRevenge was not long in coming. Pellegrini’s players, like Sunderland, were keen to press high up the pitch and they were beginning to prove considerably better at it. So much so that Agüero’s equaliser had a certain air of inevitability. Or at least it did if you ignored the statistics. With City having surrendered 1-0 on each of their previous four visits to Sunderland, Agüero’s was their first goal here since 2010.\n\nConnecting with Jesús Navas’s wonderful cross, Agüero nutmegged Sebastián Coates before lashing an unstoppable right-foot shot beyond his one-time team-mate Costel Pantilimon from the edge of the area. Perhaps anxious to emphasise he can also create, he then set up Stevan Jovetic for his side’s second.\n\nThe moment when Jovetic took aim and whipped the ball through Pantilimon’s legs came at the end of a fabulous move featuring around 30 passes. Things reached a conclusion when Yaya Touré teased Sunderland by retaining possession before picking out Agüero with his back to goal and the Argentinian lifted a perfectly cushioned flick into Jovetic’s path.\n\nWith Touré taking increasing command of central midfield, where he made life awkward for Lee Cattermole, Pellegrini’s players thoroughly deserved their lead. As a December chill which threatened to leave car windscreens in need of de-icing began to bite, Agüero, Touré and Co continued enjoying themselves. Yet good as City were, sporadic cameos indicated why Dedryck Boyata and Martín Demichelis are not Pellegrini’s first-choice central defensive combination and Fernandinho was forced to clear Rodwell’s header off the line following Larsson’s excellent corner.\n\nNot that such concerns mattered when Zabaleta struck. Reminding everyone that he is not all about defensive play, the right-back played a deft one-two with Samir Nasri before confounding Pantilimon with an audacious lob directed into the far corner.\n\nBy now Boyata’s habit of conceding unnecessarily clumsy fouls barely registered, and it became virtually irrelevant when Agüero scored his second. Meeting James Milner’s cross, he ghosted in front of Santiago Vergini before flicking a shot beyond poor Pantilimon via the inside of a post. “Finally,” said Pellegrini, “we’ve won at Sunderland.” Poyet, although the best part of two decades younger, looked considerably more tired afterwards. “City were better than us in every aspect,” he said. “And we paid the price.”"}, {"date": "02/12/2014",

against Newcastle, though a third win in four games eluded them through letting a half-time lead slip. With the teams just above them losing, three points would have been of immense value, but Papiss Cissé pounced to cancel out George Boyd’s opener early in the second half and the home side had to be satisfied with merely extending their unbeaten run.\n\n“There were good signs from us again, we know we can play,” Sean Dyche, the Burnley manager, said. “But this is a relentless, unforgiving division and we have to turn nearlys into actuals. We had a real big chance for 2-0 just before the interval and that might have swung it for us.”\n\nAlan Pardew acknowledged his patched-up side’s first-half display had been lacklustre. “It was hard to watch, I was pleased to see our fans stayed for the second half,” the Newcastle manager said. “Burnley close you down, you have to take more risks against them than we were doing. We took risks in the second half and it worked. We put Rémy Cabella on for his technical ability and we got a reward. He’s only an eight stone Frenchman but he played like a rugby prop forward.”\n\nMobile phones and the internet were new and barely-acknowledged inventions the last time these two sides met. This was not only the first-ever Premier League encounter between Burnley and Newcastle, thanks to the latter spending a season in the Championship when the Lancashire club came up last time under Owen Coyle, it was the first meeting of any kind since 1983, when both teams were in the old Second Division.\n\nIt was Burnley who were relegated 31 years ago, despite possessing players of the quality of Martin Dobson and Trevor Steven. Relegation has inevitably haunted their dreams this season too, though two wins and a draw in their last three games at least lifted Dyche’s side off the bottom and Danny Ings’ goals have permitted a degree of optimism about the future. The Burnley striker was quickly into the action here, reading Scott Arfield’s reverse pass into the area in the opening minutes and bringing the first save of the game from Rob Elliot. Newcastle attacks were more sporadic, though Tom Heaton had to make a save from Sammy Ameobi seconds after Ashley Barnes wasted a chance at the other end and Cissé should have done better than fire high into the Jimmy McIlroy stand from Yoan Gouffran’s far-post knockdown.\n\nBy the half-hour stage the running total of chances created was much more evenly shared, and it could be argued Newcastle should have taken the lead when a strong run by Mehdi Abeid took him through Burnley’s back line and all the way into the penalty area, only to place his shot too close to the goalkeeper. Instead Burnley took the lead with a handsome strike on their next attack. With his back to goal Ings guided a header back to Boyd from the edge of the visitors’ penalty area, and from just inside the D the midfielder looked up and beat Elliot with a perfectly- struck left-foot shot. Ings and Boyd were also involved in the move right at the end of the first half that saw David Jones blaze a shot over the bar when clear on goal.\n\nThey were left regretting that profligacy when Newcastle scored at the start of the second half. Alan Pardew made a double substitution, sending on Steven Taylor and Cabella, and the winger struck lucky almost immediately. From Cabella’s blocked shot, the ball ran for Daryl Janmaat to cross, and Gouffran’s flick helped it into the path of Cissé in front of goal. Burnley were sliced wide open in a way they had not been throughout the first half, and when the ball reached the striker there was never any doubt that he would find the target for his fifth goal of the season.\n\nPredictably Newcastle began playing with more confidence and authority after that, and Michael Keane was booked for halting Massadio Haidara’s flying run down the left wing by illegal means. Burnley suffered a further setback when Stephen Ward had to depart on a stretcher following a collision with Gouffran and spent most of the rest of the game on the back foot. Marney put a shot over near the end but it was a hopeful, rather tired effort from distance. Missing several first-team regulars, Newcastle, too, were tired at the close, Emmanuel Rivière conjuring a late chance for Cissé to steal a winner but the striker fell over before he could shoot."}, {"date": "02/12/2014", "arena": "The King Power Stadium", "attendance": 32000, "home_team": {"name": "Leicester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Kasper Schmeichel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ritchie de Laet", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marcin Wasilewski", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wes Morgan", "yellows": [], "reds": [63], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paul Konchesky", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [80]}, {"name": "Riyad Mahrez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matthew James", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Esteban Cambiasso", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jeffrey Schlupp", "yellows": [75], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leonardo Ulloa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jamie Vardy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Danny Drinkwater", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andy King", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marc Albrighton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [80], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Hamer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Liam Moore", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Anthony Knockaert", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Wood", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Liverpool", "lineup": [{"name": "Simon Mignolet", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [22], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Javi Manquillo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Martin Skrtel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kolo Touré", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Glen Johnson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordan Henderson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [83], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lucas Leiva", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Lallana", "yellows": [38], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [26], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [70]}, {"name": "Steven Gerrard", "yellows": [65], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [54], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Raheem Sterling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Rickie Lambert", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Brad Jones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dejan Lovren", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Philippe Coutinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alberto Moreno", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Emre Can", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Allen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [70], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lazar Markovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "So this is what Liverpool will be missing if Steven Gerrard calls time on his Anfield career. Reduced to a cameo on the 16th anniversary of his Liverpool debut, the former England captain returned re-energised on a night when he inspired his club to a second win in four days. Rolling back the years in an advanced attacking role, Gerrard registered his first goal in 12 appearances as Liverpool gave their season a shot in the arm.\n\nIt was not quite as comfortable as the scoreline suggests, with Leicester continuing to make life awkward for Liverpool even after they were reduced to 10 men in the 63rd minute, when Wes Morgan was given a straight red card for a professional foul on Rickie Lambert. Liverpool had to endure some anxious moments thereafter but the pressure valve was released when Gerrard escaped on the left to play a part in Liverpool’s third – a move that finished with Jordan Henderson dispatching Raheem Sterling’s backheel.\n\nGerrard was adamant that he should also have been awarded a penalty, when Kasper Schmeichel rushed from his line and collided with the Liverpool captain in the 73rd minute. Lee Mason waved away the appeals; Rodgers and Gerrard felt that the referee’s thinking was influenced by the fact that pointing to the spot would almost certainly have meant a red card for Schmeichel and Leicester finishing the game with nine men. “For me it is a blatant penalty,” Gerrard said.\n\nThat decision apart – and it was not clear cut – Liverpool had little to complain about on an evening when Rodgers sounded like a man who felt that his decision to rest Gerrard against Stoke on Saturday had been totally vindicated.\n\n“I think you saw the energy in his legs tonight and his influence in the game, especially as it wore on,” the Liverpool manager said. “It was an outstanding performance by Steven and an excellent goal. No matter how good a player is, there comes a time when the wheels are out and they’re ready to land. His wheels are not out yet; he’s got plenty of energy.\n\n“He looked fresh in his running tonight. He drops back into midfield to make up the third man but obviously he’s got a natural instinct to get forward and join in. His combinations tonight with Raheem and Rickie were very good and he arrives in the space you want to when the ball is cut back for a great finish.”\n\nIt was just the storyline Liverpool needed after Mario Balotelli had sabotaged the build-up to the game with his latest brush with controversy. Rodgers, not surprisingly, was more interested in talking about the “character and resolve” Liverpool showed on the pitch here, rather than what his injured Italian striker had been getting up to on Instagram.\n\n“Small steps, we’ve still got a lot of work to do,” Rodgers said. “But you saw the spirit in the team tonight, we kept fighting to the end.”\n\nFor Leicester it was another chastening evening and one that ended with Nigel Pearson embroiled in an ugly row, in which expletives were exchanged, with a fan. The Leicester manager had left his seat in the stand to come down to pitch level for the final minutes when he reacted angrily to a comment made from a supporter.\n\n“I had a spat with a fan towards the end. I don’t know what they are looking at at times,” Pearson said. “If they cannot see the players are having a proper go, maybe they need to stay home.”\n\nLeicester have now gone nine games without a win, going back to that extraordinary 5-3 victory over Manchester United at home in September, and Pearson acknowledged that his players, for all their effort and application, are stuck in a “difficult cycle to break”.\n\nThe evening had got off to a promising start for Leicester. Running on to a pass from Riyad Mahrez that exposed the space that opened up on the Liverpool left, Jamie Vardy struck a shot that Simon Mignolet got a hand to but was unable to prevent from veering towards goal. Martin Skrtel was well positioned to clear off the line but Leonardo Ulloa retrieved the loose ball at the byline and turned to hit a shot that cannoned off the near upright, struck Mignolet on the back of the head and rolled into the net.\n\nIt has been that sort of season for the Liverpool goalkeeper, who was fortunate not to concede seconds earlier when a woeful pass intended for Skrtel ended up at Esteban Cambiasso’s feet. With the goal at his mercy the Argentinian stroked the ball wide.\n\nLiverpool’s response to falling behind was swift. Morgan, tussling with Lambert, was unable to get any distance on his header from Lucas Leiva’s floated cross, and Adam Lallana was on to the ball in a flash, striking a left-footed half-volley that arrowed past Schmeichel.\n\nMorgan, who endured a torrid evening, was also involved in Liverpool’s second goal, when he succeeded only in deflecting Sterling’s cross into the path of Gerrard, who was perfectly placed to stroke a first-time shot from 12 yards into the corner. Cambiasso saw his shot blocked by Vardy, his own player, as Leicester refused to surrender, but the game was up for the home team when Gerrard broke on the left and Schmeichel could only parry his deflected cross.

This was a fourth consecutive league win under Louis van Gaal, as the side continues to settle as the manager predicted they would on becoming familiar with his methods.\n\nThese remain early days, yet before Monday’s visit to Southampton there can only be optimism regarding United’s consistent form. At the close they rode their luck but had earned this fortune due to a display that left players and fans content, though Van Gaal less so.\n\n“I’m happy with the result – tomorrow we have a Christmas party and it’s important we can enjoy that. I am not happy with the performance. I wasnot pleased with the first half. We were not so aggressive as in the last match and we want to play in the same style. I think we don’t keep our positions on the pitch, so we don’t create so many chances in the first half. Only the chance from [Ander] Herrera and then we have to finish that of course,” he said before hailing Marouane Fellaini’s header. “OK, the goal was a very nice goal also.”\n\nThe team news consisted of Wayne Rooney being unfit due to a knee problem suffered in Saturday’s 3-0 win over Hull City. This meant James Wilson was named ahead of Radamel Falcao for only a second Premier League start of his career. The other change from the weekend was Herrera for Ángel di María, who had suffered a hamstring injury.\n\nOf Rooney Van Gaal said: “It is his knee but we have to wait for tomorrow to say anything about it because you never know with a knee. In my opinion it is not so heavy but I am not a doctor.\n\n“We have to wait a scan and we will know more. Di María is not so heavy but, of course, he shall not play against Southampton but you never know.”\n\nUnited should have taken the lead when Asmir Begovic’s mistake handed possession to Robin van Persie inside the goalkeeper’s area. Yet despite Wilson being available, the Dutch striker chose to pass to Herrera, who skied over from close in.\n\nHerrera was about to make amends. The No21 lined up in the middle of United’s advanced midfield trident, yet was using much of the turf. When Juan Mata moved along the left, it was Herrera who provided the overlap to run on to the ball and swing in a perfect left-foot cross that had Fellaini rising to head home in the 21st minute.\n\nStoke had barely threatened the home side and, as the half went on, there was a sense that only United could undo themselves. And so it proved six minutes before the interval. When Herrera passed to Fellaini, the midfielder suddenly went down holding his neck. From the ensuing move the ball ricocheted off Chris Smalling, following a Bojan Krkic run, and into Steven Nzonzi’s path. The midfielder emphatically beat David de Gea and it was one apiece.\n\nBefore this the home support had been singing their favourite carol. This is the one that goes to the tune of Twelve Days of Christmas and that starts with “Five Cantonas”. When the referee, Jon Moss, blew for half-time this festive cheer had dissipated.\n\nFellaini had walked off having missed a chance to register his and the team’s second while holding the troublesome neck. However, he was fit to resume after the break and was soon linking up with Herrera and Antonio Valencia along United’s right.\n\nAs on Saturday Herrera was involved in much of his team’s smart play. The next time came when he appeared down Valencia’s flank and with a smart soft-shoe shuffle won a free-kick with which Mata should have done better than hit straight at Begovic.\n\nUnited were pouring forward. Fellaini, Van Persie, Herrera and Wilson were all involved as the 20-times champions threatened to retake the lead only to be repelled by stiff Stoke resistance.\n\nThis was about to crumple. From the right Mata again curved in a high ball and this time, with Marcos Rojo in attendance, a host of Stoke players, including Ryan Shawcross, merely watched as it bounced past Begovic and in to give United the advantage again in the 59th minute.\n\nRojo’s girlfriend later posted a photograph online to prove he had got the final touch but by the close no one in red cared. Wilson provided the contest’s exhilarating moment. Receiving the ball near halfway, a burst of pace swept him through and, though the shot was wide, here was an impressive marker from the 18-year-old. After Mame Diouf twice had efforts repelled off the United line, including a memorable save from De Gea and an Ashley Young clearance, the same could be said of United.\n\nVan Gaal added: “In the second half we played much better, more aggressive but then you have to finish it. Wilson could have finished it, Fellaini could have finished it. We knew in advance it is difficult to defend long balls and [we had] a great save from De Gea and a little bit of luck from Ashley Young. You have to see the whole match and say there is one team that deserved it and that is Manchester United.”\n\nHe was not wrong."}, {"date": "02/12/2014", "arena": "The Liberty Stadium", "attendance":

weekend, when Swansea were disappointed that they could only draw at home to Crystal Palace while QPR were greatly encouraged by their victory over Leicester, which lifted them off the bottom of the table. Harry Redknapp, however, knows his charges need to improve their away form if they are to survive.\n\nBoth managers made changes. Monk recalled the metronome they call Leon Britton in midfield in place of Jonjo Shelvey, who handed Palace their equaliser on Saturday as well as spurning an open goal. Also “rested” was Àngel Rangel, whose right-back position went to Jazz Richards. Redknapp reinstated Dunne in central defence, to the exclusion of Mauricio Isla. The veteran’s strength was needed to combat the power game that has made Wilfried Bony the leading scorer in the league during this calendar year and his performance entirely justified his return. “Richard defends for his life and he’ll always give you everything”, Redknapp said.\n\nNedum Onuoha, switched to right-back for this game, is a centre-half by trade and inclination, and Swansea’s left-winger, Jefferson Montero, regularly beat him on the outside. One of the Ecuadorian’s crosses culminated in a mishit shot from Gylfi Sigurdsson, which had Green scrambling to his right.\n\nGreen was also extended in keeping out the dangerous near-post header with which Kyle Bartley met Sigurdsson’s corner from the right and again in repelling the Icelander’s well-directed free-kick.\n\nFor a long time it was a case of déjà vu for Swansea and their supporters, whose frustration for most of the game was a hangover from Saturday. QPR might even have burgled the lead before half-time, Leroy Fer meeting Niko Kranjcar’s cross six yards out with a header which Lukasz Fabianski did well to keep out.\n\nDunne fully vindicated his selection when twice in a minute he tackled Bony well inside the penalty area, preventing an almost certain goal on each occasion and for the second time in four days the Liberty crowd, usually so vocal with their hymns and arias, fell into an apprehensive silence.\n\nGreen pipped Dunne for the man-of-the-match honours and twice in quick succession the former England goalkeeper called to mind his peak years in thwarting Bony.\n\nWhen relief came for Monk and company it arrived at the double. First Ki easily evaded Onuoha before driving left-footed across Green and in via the keeper’s left-hand upright. Then five minutes later Routledge doubled the margin, accepting the substitute Nathan Dyer’s centre and scoring from a central position 20 yards out, his shot nestling into Green’s right corner.\n\n“We were close to hanging on but couldn’t quite do it”, Redknapp said. “Robert Green was in great form tonight and when you get to 0-0 with 15 minutes to go you think you might even nick a result. But Swansea are a good team and for the promoted clubs, like us, the Premier League is a big step up.”\n\nOf QPR’s dire away form he said: “The seven away games have all been against teams in the top half of the table and they’ve all been hard.” He is hoping for respite, and three points, when Burnley visit on Saturday."}, {"date": "02/12/2014", "arena": "Selhurst Park", "attendance": 23935,

Benteke since March. It eases the pressure on a side who somehow left south London three points better off, with Benteke’s first-half effort enough for a valuable win despite the visitors spending most of the match on the defensive.\n\nFor Crystal Palace and Neil Warnock sharpening their attack must now be a priority. Too often they were let down by disappointing decisions and terrible touches. Brad Guzan ultimately proved unbeatable and Villa, so often on the receiving end of late goals, held on.\n\nWilfried Zaha and Yannick Bolasie were typically energetic but lacked the final product. While the Palace ownership issue lingers on – with Josh Harris’ mooted takeover not expected to be resolved until the New Year – Villa’s American owner, Randy Lerner, will be able to take solace from this result. It ended a rot that had threatened to seep into the busy Christmas period.\n\n“We are now four games unbeaten. That is really important,” said Lambert, who also insisted there was “no bust-up” with Roy Keane before the Irishman’s departure as assistant manager. “Aston Villa is a football club where the expectancy is huge because of the name, the tradition, and we have got to live up to that. Nobody wants to see the club where it has been for the last few years.\n\n“Christian came back today with a fantastic goal. He offers you that. What he had was a really bad injury. To come back from that, he has been excellent. I’ve been fortunate to play with some of the best players in the world scoring-wise and, if he keeps progressing the way he is, he’ll hit those heights.”\n\nVilla started poorly but ended the first half in front courtesy of Benteke’s first goal of the campaign. Joe Cole was replaced in the ninth minute by Carlos Sánchez because of injury as Villa attempted to quell early Palace pressure. Brad Guzan fumbled an early effort from Bolasie and Mile Jedinak could not quite make decisive contact when backheeling from a corner.\n\nTheir resistance paid off. Benteke, returning from a three-match suspension following a red card against Tottenham, was the only man who looked like causing Palace any trouble and so it proved.There was a warning sign four minutes before his goal when the Belgian striker turned Scott Dann on the edge of the penalty area and curled an effort towards the top corner but Julian Speroni tipped it over.\n\nSperoni was helpless when Benteke gave his side the lead, however. Again at fault was Dann, the centre-half who has performed admirably this season. Benteke dispossessed the defender on the left touchline midway inside the Palace half before driving forward and finishing precisely into the bottom corner.\n\nWarnock said: “I think he [Dann] should have kicked it over the stand. You can’t score in Row Z. It’s a cruel punishment. We’re disappointed that they didn’t have to work hard for the goal. It just wasn’t meant to be tonight.”\n\nGuzan’s goal came under renewed threat but the American was not to be beaten before the break, with Zaha and Bolasie denied from inside the area. The second half continued in much the same vein but both wide men lacked composure when delivering a final ball.\n\nFraizer Campbell had been brought on at half-time for Dwight Gayle and certainly provided Palace with greater impetus in attack. The former Manchester United striker broke clear of the last man in the 57th minute and, in a desperate attempt to reach James McArthur’s through-ball, ended up clattering Guzan who had already cleared.\n\nCampbell received a yellow card and was moments later involved in more controversy, going down in the penalty area under a challenge from Ciaran Clark. The referee, Michael Oliver, deemed it a fair challenge much to the anger of the Selhurst Park crowd who were becoming increasingly incensed with the official. Warnock said: “I think he’s [Oliver] in a poor position. He doesn’t see the right arm pull Fraizer back.”\n\nAndreas Weimann missed a glorious chance and at the other end Zaha flashed a low ball through a clutch of bodies late on but no Palace player could turn it home inside the six-yard box.\n\nIt summed up a wasteful night for the Eagles."}, {"date": "02/12/2014", "arena": "The Hawthorns", "attendance": 23975, "home_team": {"name": "West Bromwich

they were chanting about winning the league. Such is the fickle nature of football but, after recovering from going behind to embellish their best start to a Premier League season with goals from Kevin Nolan and James Tomkins, the West Ham manager could bask in the relative glory of his team staying fifth in the table, a point outside the Champions League places.\n\n“We’re going to win the league now,” Allardyce quipped, reminded of that visit here in April. “That’s long in the past now. The game moves on very quickly. Our summer of hard work and recruitment is paying off. Our strength in depth is standing us in good stead because we’re having to use our squad to the maximum. Twenty-four points at this stage of the season – that’s one hell of a total when you think this time last year we were almost in the bottom three.”\n\nSaido Berahino’s goal when the teams last met had ended West Bromwich Albion’s fears of relegation last season but not enhanced Pepe Mel’s job prospects. Now Alan Irvine, the Spaniard’s successor, is having to fight off fans’ criticism after four straight defeats. “I can’t control that,” the West Brom head coach said. “It comes with the territory. We’re a lot stronger when everyone’s pulling in the same direction.”\n\nTwo points above the relegation zone, Albion’s next three games look critical: at Hull City on Saturday, at home to Aston Villa and then away to QPR. It is hard not to feel sympathy for Irvine, who inherited a messy situation with 11 players out of contract in the summer, but despite dominating the second half last night there was a tangible lack of conviction as Albion attempted to stick to their beliefs in playing a patient build-up.\n\nThe game ended with the bizarre sight of Ben Foster wandering around in the West Ham half but when a fine flying volley from Graham Dorrans fizzed past Adrián’s post, West Brom knew, yet again, that it was not their day.\n\nYet they had started brightly. Irvine recalled Victor Anichebe to play alongside Berahino with Stéphane Sessègnon just behind and, when the former Everton forward, bustling his way towards the corner of the penalty area, was brought down by Tomkins, Dorrans delivered a devilish inswinging free-kick for Craig Dawson to head powerfully home.\n\nThis was the first time a West Brom player had scored in 370 minutes of Premier League action – Esteban Cambiasso’s own-goal had sealed their three points away to Leicester City – and the only negative at this stage for Irvine was that the breakthrough appeared to stir West Ham from their slumbers.\n\nWith both teams playing diamonds the midfield became very congested but West Ham always threatened from set pieces. From Stewart Downing’s corner in the 19th minute Tomkins headed down and Foster saved superbly from Nolan’s overhead kick before denying Cheikhou Kouyaté on the rebound.\n\nThis sequence was repeated in part after Chris Brunt was cautioned for felling Nolan. Tomkins this time headed down Downing’s free-kick, Foster parried Andy Carroll’s bicycle kick but Nolan – back in as captain for the injured Mark Noble – stooped to head in his first goal of the season on only his fourth league start.\n\nTo add insult in injury time Brunt had to be withdrawn with a damaged hamstring and West Ham went ahead. Again it was from a delivery from Downing, the most creative player in the Premier League so far this season, that Tomkins was able to win the first ball, this time heading home directly. This was a better use of his head than when he went down clutching his face when tapped by Everton’s Kevin Mirallas 11 days ago.\n\nWest Brom’s diminishing confidence levels have been reflected in the form of Berahino who had not scored in the previous four games since his call-up to the England squad and his arrest on suspicion of drink driving. So, even when the home side started the second half bullishly, progress was undermined when their leading scorer took an airshot at Joleon Lescott’s downward header and then Dawson slashed his shot wide from 10 yards.\n\nWest Ham, defeated only once in their last eight games now, defended resolutely to seal the victory that their first-half dominance merited. “It’s not often I’ve been involved in a more one-sided half where you don’t get something out of the game,” Irvine reflected. “It’s not so long ago Sam was going through a difficult period, Alan Pardew, you name a manager. You’ve just got to keep doing the things you believe in.”"}, {"date": "30/11/2014", "arena": " Mary's Stadium", "attendance": 30919, "home_team": {"name": "Southampton", "lineup": [{"name": "Fraser Forster", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathaniel Clyne", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "José Fonte", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Toby Alderweireld", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Bertrand", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Davis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [82]}, {"name": "Victor Wanyama", "yellows": [7], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Morgan Schneiderlin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Dusan Tadic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Graziano Pellè", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sadio Mané", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [68]}], "subs": [{"name": "Kelvin Davis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Maya Yoshida", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Florin Gardos", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shane Long", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [68], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Emmanuel Mayuka", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [82], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harrison Reed", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matt Targett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Manchester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Joe Hart", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pablo Zabaleta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Vincent Kompany", "yellows": [81], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eliaquim Mangala", "yellows": [22], "reds": [74], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gael Clichy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [88], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jesus Navas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [76]}, {"name": "Fernandinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yaya Touré", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [51], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Samir Nasri", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [65]}, {"name": "Stevan Jovetic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [55]}, {"name": "Sergio Agüero", "yellows": [9], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Bacary Sagna", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fernando", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Milner", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [55], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willy Caballero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Frank Lampard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [80], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [65], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martín Demichelis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [76], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jose Pozo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "The champions are stirring.

It was at this stage last term that City embarked on a run of 11 wins in 12 unbeaten league games to mount the challenge that would eventually yield a second title in three seasons. As José Mourinho has consistently suggested at Chelsea, this year’s race is far from run.\n\nThere was panache to the way the visitors responded to Mangala’s loss when their lead had suddenly been rendered fragile, the manner in which the substitutes, James Milner and Frank Lampard, combined for the latter to dispatch his side’s second 10 minutes from time – a precise finish from the edge of the area – a reminder of underlying pedigree.\n\nRetaining the veteran former England midfielder once his loan deal from New York City expires in January is fast becoming a priority. Sergio Agüero, on his 100th league appearance for the club, subsequently conjured a glorious assist for Gaël Clichy to belt in a first City goal, as an unlikely right winger, two minutes from time.\n\nThat ambition to keep pouring forward even with their number depleted gave the scoreline gloss that was rather harsh on Southampton, but left the whole occasion feeling like a statement of the champions’ intent. Visiting teams tend not to run riot at St Mary’s these days. There is normally too much class to Ronald Koeman’s team for them to be overrun and overwhelmed, too much poise in their play and pace in their approach to be humiliated, and few other sides will hope to register a victory this eye-catching on the south coast.\n\nThe hosts were undoubtedly hampered by Morgan Schneiderlin’s departure with a thigh injury at the interval, not least because the Frenchman’s absence thrust the side’s best defender, Toby Alderweireld, into a midfield brief. They never really recovered from the reshuffle, their shield in the centre breached and bypassed. Koeman’s team have their own daunting schedule ahead, with two games against Manchester United plus Arsenal, Chelsea and Everton to come before mid-January. Theirs has now become a test of recovery before Wednesday’s game at the Emirates, with improvement required.\n\n“Morgan is always a big influence on our game and we don’t have the squad like City to change things,” said the home manager. “But if you make these kind of mistakes … It was not good enough today. Maybe two or three of my players reached the level they can [normally] show. We were punished for that.”\n\nThey had been provided with an early escape when Agüero wriggled into the area and poked the ball beyond José Fonte, whose sliding challenge was mistimed and floored the Argentinian. The referee was perfectly positioned to witness the foul, which made his decision to flash a yellow for a dive all the more mystifying. Alderweireld had done well to improvise a block from Stevan Jovetic’s attempt just after the half-hour, but the home side never really came closer to scoring than in a pinball midway through the opening period when Joe Hart denied Graziano Pellè’s tentative prod and Steven Davis’ more threatening follow-up. Thereafter their sights of goal were more often snatched glimpses from distance.\n\nCity, in contrast, were increasingly menacing with Schneiderlin retired. Their opener had been forged by slick approach play around the edge of the Southampton penalty area, home players passing up opportunities to clear their lines before Agüero glided into space and on to Fernandinho’s pass, glanced up, and picked out Yaya Touré. The Ivorian was allowed to charge unhindered on to the striker’s delivery to dispatch a low drive which flicked off a home player to skim beyond Fraser Forster and in.\n\nThey appeared untroubled thereafter, Milner and Lampard busily shoring up midfield and Jesús Navas and Agüero passing up opportunities to extend the lead, before Shane Long pounced on Touré’s indecision to steal possession and dart towards goal. Mangala felled the forward just outside the box and the Frenchman was booked and dismissed, having earlier been cautioned for tripping Dusan Tadic.\n\n“I thought Mangala played very well today,” said Pellegrini. “It was not him who lost the ball, so it was unnecessary. Remember, Southampton have important strikers and they had just one chance against our goalkeeper.” That was a reflection of the visitors’ underlying dominance. Southampton need not be deflated given the gulf in resources between the sides, but this was the natural order reimposing itself near the top. City’s pursuit is on.\n\nMan of the match Sergio Agüero (Manchester City)"}, {"date": "30/11/2014", "arena": "White Hart Lane", "attendance": 35901, "home_team": {"name": "Tottenham Hotspur", "lineup": [{"name": "Hugo Lloris", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Vlad Chiriches", "yellows": [56], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [70]}, {"name": "Federico Fazio", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jan Vertonghen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Davies", "yellows": [89], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Mason", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nabil Bentaleb", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Lennon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [61]}, {"name": "Harry Kane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Eriksen", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [21], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Roberto Soldado", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [45], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [81]}], "subs": [{"name": "Younes Kaboul", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paulinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [81], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Erik Lamela", "yellows": [87], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [61], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michel Vorm", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eric Dier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [70], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mousa Dembélé", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nacer Chadli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Everton", "lineup": [{"name": "Tim Howard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Seamus Coleman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Jagielka", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sylvain Distin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leighton Baines", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Muhamed Besic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gareth Barry", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin Mirallas", "yellows": [43], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [15], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [61]}, {"name": "Samuel Eto'o", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [61]}, {"name": "Ross Barkley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Romelu Lukaku", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Joel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tony Hibbert", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aiden McGeady", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [61], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Atsu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leon Osman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [61], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Pienaar", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Luke Garbutt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Roberto Soldado’s goal that beat Everton was his first in the Premier League since March. It was only his third in open play for Tottenham Hotspur in the league since his high-profile transfer from Valencia in the summer of last year. But to the club’s supporters, it was a thing of great beauty and something to enhance further his status in their eyes.\n\nSoldado is an unlikely hero, given the paucity of his return in the competition that he was signed to illuminate. But Spurs fans have consistently offered him incredible backing and he repaid them with the moment in first-half injury-time when he took Aaron Lennon’s through-ball and hammered it past the Everton goalkeeper, Tim Howard.\n\nThis was not a great overall performance from Soldado. He had missed his challenge on Kevin Mirallas just before the Everton attacker bent home a cracking shot to open the scoring and he fluffed his lines when an opportunity knocked on 37 minutes. But he scored and it turned out to be the winner. When he was substituted late on he departed to a standing ovation. Soldado had continued up front alongside Harry Kane; Emmanuel Adebayor, according to the manager, Mauricio Pochettino, was absent because of illness.\n\nTottenham showed their character to fight back and record their finest win under Pochettino and he was particularly pleased at breaking the negative cycle at White Hart Lane, where the team have lost four times in the league. This was a display of tempo and aggression, fired by Kane, who played a prominent role in both goals, and the stadium has not seemed so positive for some time.\n\n“It’s not only three points; it’s a little bit more,” Pochettino said. “The team have sent a different signal to our supporters. I understand why they were angry. Winning away and losing at home is not the right way.”\n\nEverton had started brightly but they were second best from the moment the excellent Christian Eriksen equalised and Roberto Martínez, the manager, was left to lament the failure of Michael Oliver to spot what he felt was a penalty for handball against Federico Fazio in the 90th minute. The Tottenham defender had jumped with Romelu Lukaku and with his hand raised. Martínez also complained about a possible foul by Kane on Gareth Barry in the buildup to Soldado’s goal.\n\n“Fazio makes himself really big and closes his eyes and he’s in an unusual position when the ball hits him,” Martinez said. “It hits him in the arm and it should have been a penalty. I am disappointed. It should have been spotted.”\n\nPochettino took a different view – “It was not a penalty,” he said – and he preferred to talk up what was a third come-from-behind league win in four matches for his team. The passion in his goal celebrations told its own story.\n\nThe victory also improved Tottenham’s record after Thursday night Europa League games – they now have three wins to go with their four defeats. Everton, who are also in the competition, have won one, drawn one and lost three. Tottenham had beaten Partizan Belgrade here on Thursday night; Everton won at Wolfsburg.\n\nIt was an entertaining game and Everton ought to have led when Ross Barkley’s pass ricocheted and then broke off a Tottenham defender for Lukaku. From close range he was denied by Hugo Lloris. Everton, though, took charge after Ryan Mason had headed away from Leighton Baines’ free-kick and Mirallas won the ball back, having made light of Soldado’s weak challenge. He dropped his shoulder and jinked inside before unfurling a glorious right-footer from 20 yards that arced into the far, top corner.\n\nTottenham looked nervy and when the stand-in right-back, Vlad Chiriches, who would later go off with cramp, nearly sold Lloris short with a back-pass, there was that hum of grumbling that has been heard so often here this season. Yet Pochettino’s team turned it around, thanks in no small measure to the fearless running of Kane.\n\nThe young striker was central to the equaliser, slicing through the Everton defence and shooting low at goal. Howard parried and Eriksen reacted quickest to drift the ball back into the far corner.\n\nEriksen shot narrowly wide and Soldado’s touch let him down when he was well placed following Muhamed Besic’s loose back header before Kane provided another spark. He won the ball from Barry to allow Lennon to tear at the Everton defence. The slide-rule pass was perfectly weighted for Soldado, who took one touch to set himself and another to score.\n\nEverton looked flat. Seamus Coleman was denied by Lloris at close quarters from Barkley’s pass on 71 minutes and their luck was out when Fazio got the benefit of the doubt from Oliver at the very end.\n\nMan of the match

"report": "It was starting to feel like the calm after the storm for Arsène Wenger. Hot on the heels of the midweek victory over Borussia Dortmund that secured their place in the knockout stage of the Champions League, Arsenal registered a first Premier League win since the start of the month courtesy of a lovely piece of wing-play from Santi Cazorla and a fine Danny Welbeck header.\n\nThat should have been that and provided Wenger with good cause to leave with a smile on his face, but as the Arsenal players celebrated at the final whistle, a banner was unfurled in the visiting end by a small group of supporters calling for the manager to pack his bags. “Arsène, thanks for the memories, but it’s time to say goodbye” read the message.\n\nWenger knew nothing about the banner – cynics will no doubt think that it is not unlike the Frenchman to miss a major talking point – but he was clearly far from impressed when told of the wording. “I don’t comment on that,” the Arsenal manager said. Another attempt to extract Wenger’s thoughts was met with the same terse response.\n\nIt was a strange ending to what had been a largely satisfactory afternoon for Arsenal, give or take another three injuries. Nacho Monreal limped off with a knee problem, Kieran Gibbs, the Spaniard’s replacement, picked up an ankle injury and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, a late substitute, also took a blow to his knee. “We have to see how they recover on Monday,” Wenger said. “How bad they are, I don’t know.”\n\nAt least the result, a clean sheet and the sight of Welbeck scoring – his third for Arsenal in the Premier League – gave Wenger some comfort. The win was no more than Arsenal deserved after dominating for long periods, with Cazorla the star of the show, yet there was nearly a sting in the tail. Saido Berahino’s header, nine minutes from time, came back off the crossbar and there was another anxious moment for Arsenal when Craig Gardner’s drive deflected inches wide in the dying seconds.\n\nOtherwise, Arsenal looked reasonably comfortable and it was only the absence of a more clinical edge to their attacking play that spared a hugely disappointing West Bromwich Albion side from being on the end of a more resounding defeat.\n\n“It was a game we controlled well until we scored our goal, but we didn’t take our chances and then, when you cannot finish the game off, having given what you have given on Wednesday night, you know that it could be difficult to finish the game today,” Wenger said. “But in the end our solidarity got us through when the legs went in the last 15 minutes. Maybe we were a fraction lucky as well with the crossbar, but overall it’s a well-deserved win.”\n\nIt was hard to argue with that assessment. Albion were desperately poor until the final 15 minutes and there was no escaping the frustration building among their supporters. “You don’t know what you’re doing” reverberated around The Hawthorns when Alan Irvine, the head coach, replaced Stéphane Sessègnon with Georgios Samaras. “It’s not nice to hear it,” Irvine said. “People have their own opinions. It very nearly worked. We looked as though we might score when we hadn’t looked like doing that prior to the changes.”\n\nIrvine was more disappointed that Berahino was incorrectly flagged offside early in the second half, when he escaped in the inside-left channel. “That’s two weeks in a row now, two big decisions that have been wrong against us,” he said. “People make mistakes, but we could do without them, because it doesn’t half make the job against teams like Chelsea and Arsenal an awful lot more difficult.”\n\nIt was a drab game that only came to life after the interval – one photo taken of Oxlade-Chamberlain in the first half appeared to show him asleep on the bench. Welbeck, playing out wide to accommodate Olivier Giroud’s return from injury, went close in the 26th minute, when Ben Foster saved at his feet, and Aaron Ramsey dragged a low shot wide as Arsenal continued to make the running.\n\nThe breakthrough finally arrived on the hour mark. Cazorla, showing tenacity and a turn of pace on the left, slipped past Andre Wisdom before standing up a deep cross that Welbeck, towering above Sébastien Pocognoli, headed home despite Foster getting his right hand to the ball.\n\n“Cazorla’s class got us that goal,” Wenger said. “He had a few opportunities in the first half, he cannot finish at the moment, but in providing he is still top-class.”"}, {"date": "29/11/2014", "arena": "Turf Moor", "attendance": 19910, "home_team": {"name": "Burnley", "lineup": [{"name": "Tom Heaton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals":

as Danny Ings’s late penalty denied them victory to start the post-Roy Keane era. Keane’s decision to leave his position as assistant manager meant Paul Lambert brought the first-team coach, Scott Marshall, on to the bench in the hope of masterminding a first win in nine games and opening up some daylight above the bottom three.\n\nJust as importantly he gave a first start of the season to the former England midfielder Joe Cole, now 33, who showed he still has plenty to offer by giving Villa a first-half lead. That lasted until four minutes from the end when Burnley’s renewed belief that they can beat the drop was evident again. They came charging back, earning a point when Ings converted from the spot to make it four goals in his last five games before almost winning it with an injury-time effort that hit a post.\n\n“I wish I had Joe five years earlier,” Lambert said. “He was fantastic. For a guy that’s won a lot in the game, there was great enthusiasm. The young guys can certainly take a look at him.\n\n“It was the best we’ve played in quite a few weeks. It was a game that got away from us and we could have lost it in the end, which would have been a travesty.”\n\nWhile Villa did not play like a side in trouble, points are ultimately what matter and Lambert still has to convince all of his side’s supporters that he is the man to lead the club into calmer waters. For most of the game the travelling support was magnificent in their backing for the team, although by the end there were some dissenting voices.\n\nLambert again pledged to remedy the situation. “These guys pay their money and I’ve got no problem with that. I know this club is huge and the expectancy levels are massive. I’ll do the best I possibly can. It’s up to us to find the solution.”\n\nHad Burnley taken more of their late chances things could have been even more awkward for Lambert. Their manager, Sean Dyche, said: “With the chances we created you are scratching your head how we didn’t win it, but on the balance of the game it’s fair to say it was a close affair. They are certainly not a team that’s broken. There’s plenty of energy and a belief in them and some good players there.”\n\nVilla’s build-up to the game had been far from ideal on the back of Keane’s sudden departure and their record at Turf Moor didn’t bode well for a change in their fortunes.Remarkably, Villa had not won at Burnley in 23 league games in a run going back to 1936, , although the Clarets had not managed three successive top-flight wins since 1975.\n\nThey have, though, had only two seasons in the top tier since then, both ending in relegation. That might have seemed their lot again a month ago but Burnley now look a different proposition, even if they had to ride their luck early on as Dean Marney made two blocks in front of goal to prevent the on-loan Manchester United defender Michael Keane scoring an own-goal on his first Premier League start, and to deny the Villa centre-back Ciaran Clark.\n\nTom Heaton also thwarted Gabriel Agbonlahor but Villa’s seventh goal of the season arrived seven minutes before the break when Cole, recruited on a free transfer in the summer, steered the ball home at the near post from Andreas Weimann’s pass.\n\nThe script was written but Burnley spoiled Cole and Lambert’s happy ending. Michael Kightly was denied a leveller by Brad Guzan with nearly an hour gone but when When Jores Okore pulled down the substitute Lukas Jutkiewicz with four minutes to go, Ings stayed calm to equalise from the spot."}, {"date": "29/11/2014", "arena": "Anfield", "attendance": 44735, "home_team": {"name": "Liverpool", "lineup": [{"name": "Simon Mignolet", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Glen Johnson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [85], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Skrtel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kolo Touré", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jose Enrique", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lucas Leiva", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [75]}, {"name": "Joe Allen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordan Henderson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Philippe Coutinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [88]}, {"name": "Raheem Sterling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rickie Lambert", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Brad Jones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dejan Lovren", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [88], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Gerrard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [75], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alberto Moreno", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Lallana", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Emre Can", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lazar Markovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Stoke City", "lineup": [{"name": "Asmir Begovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Geoff Cameron", "yellows": [53], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Shawcross", "yellows": [58], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marc Wilson", "yellows": [38], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Erik Pieters", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steve Sidwell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [22]}, {"name": "Steven N'Zonzi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jon Walters", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bojan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marko Arnautovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [88]}, {"name": "Mame Biram Diouf", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Marc Muniesa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Glenn Whelan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [22], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Stephen Ireland", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charlie Adam", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Butland", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Peter Crouch", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [88], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Oliver Shenton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Liverpool still do not look convincing top-four candidates but at least the rot has been stopped. A late goal by Glen Johnson secured the first win of a fraught November and meant Stoke left empty-handed after a battling performance for the second season in succession. On the opening day last season Simon Mignolet saved a last-minute penalty to deny Stoke what would have been a well-deserved point. The home side lived dangerously in the last few minutes but were slightly better value for their victory here, and that might be the best news Brendan Rodgers has had in weeks. “We needed a result and we needed to show resilience and courage,” Rodgers said. “We did all that: we kept going against a good team.”\n\nIt is exactly 16 years since Steven Gerrard made his Liverpool debut and the Anfield match programme went big on the anniversary, though the Liverpool captain had to be satisfied with a place on the bench. He is 34 after all, and Rodgers accepts he should not be asked to play three games in a week, though that hardly applies to the rest of the Liverpool substitutes. Five of Liverpool’s summer signings found themselves keeping Gerrard company on the sidelines, with Rickie Lambert, in for the injured Mario Balotelli, the only capture with the Luis Suárez money asked to start the game. Liverpool spent almost £120m in the summer, just £4m of it invested in Lambert as a supposed Plan B.\n\nRodgers’ transfer business has come under scrutiny during Liverpool’s run of defeats. One highly critical supporter on the radio before kick-off said faults were glaringly obvious last season even though a second-place finish was achieved, and went so far as to describe Suárez as a fig leaf that covered the side’s many embarrassing shortcomings. The Uruguay striker has been called many things in his time, but a fig leaf of respectability is probably a first.\n\nSuárez would certainly have enlivened proceedings here. It is no exaggeration to suggest the loudest cheer of a numbingly dull first half-hour was for the sight of Gerrard taking a jog along the touchline with the other substitutes. Raheem Sterling put a low cross along the six-yard line early on with no team-mates sufficiently far up the pitch to take advantage, the less than universally popular Johnson allowed himself to be dispossessed on the edge of his own area but got away with it because Bojan Krkic could not find anyone in support either, and, give or take a shot at each end from Martin Skrtel and Jon Walters, that was about it for first-half excitement. When Philippe Coutinho set off on a run on the stroke of half-time, making space for a shot but ultimately scuffing it, the Stoke fans in the Anfield Road end dryly began chanting: “Suárez would have scored that.”\n\nStoke played a tight, tidy pressing game without creating too many attacking chances, Liverpool were presumably supposed to be advancing through Coutinho, Sterling or Jordan Henderson with the ball on the floor but ended up lumping hopeful long balls in the direction of Lambert. It produced a stalemate that suited the visitors, one place above Liverpool in the table, but left the locals wondering what exactly Rodgers meant when he said his side could still manage a top-four finish. People are beginning to collect Brendanisms, and there was a marvellous one in the manager’s programme notes. “Only our confidence has been knocked,” he said. “Belief has not been affected.”\n\nMignolet’s confidence must have been affected by all the criticism that has come his way of late, some of it justified, but the goalkeeper came to Liverpool’s rescue when Stoke threatened a breakaway goal. Krkic measured a pass perfectly to play in the impressive Mame Biram Diouf behind Skrtel but Mignolet was out quickly to first make the angle difficult then smother the eventual shot.\n\nThe game briefly came to life after that, with Krkic thumping a shot against an upright when he appeared to have done everything necessary to score, and Sterling going straight down the other end to miss the target by a matter of inches. Lucas really should have opened the scoring when a loose pass by Marko Arnautovic invited Liverpool to break in numbers from halfway, but when a clear shooting opportunity opened up with the whole of the goal to aim at from inside the area the midfielder could only manage to find Asmir Begovic standing tall. Liverpool were building up a head of steam by the last quarter, however, and after Lambert forced another save from Begovic the best chance of the game was put over the bar by Joe Allen, whose close-range shot took a deflection off Charlie Adam.\n\nUnsurprisingly Rodgers turned to Gerrard before any of his other substitutes in an attempt to break the deadlock, sending his captain on for the last 15 minutes. An obvious, if cliched scenario now presented itself but it did not happen. Instead of Gerrard coming up with the winning goal in the closing minutes it was Johnson, bravely diving in for a header after Lambert had seen an attempt come back off the bar, picking up a cut on the head from contact with Erik Pieters’ boot in the process but ultimately forcing the ball past Begovic in front of the Kop.\n\nAll Liverpool had to worry about after that was Rodgers’ decision to reinforce the defence with Dejan Lovren for the time that remained, including a whopping seven added minutes. “It was a bit harsh at the end, we deserved to leave with something,” Mark Hughes said. “We put a huge effort in and I thought Bojan was the best player on the pitch. We are really encouraged by what he is producing, what we need to do is find a way of giving him the ball more often.”"}, {"date": "29/11/2014", "arena": "Old Trafford", "attendance": 75345,

Louis van Gaal project.\n\nThe caveat was the sight of Ángel Di María pulling up injured and Wayne Rooney requiring treatment at the close for a knee problem. Yet an outing featuring a slice of goalscoring redemption for Robin van Persie, a first appearance for Radamel Falcao in nearly six weeks and a third consecutive victory for the first time under Van Gaal should hardly be grumbled at.\n\nThe manager confirmed Di María had pulled his hamstring muscle when near the centre circle and, after being replaced moments later by Ander Herrera, is out of Stoke City’s visit on Tuesday.\n\nWhile there is less concern over Rooney – he also suffered a kick to a calf – Di María’s removal forced the manager into a reshuffle. Van Persie, who had been operating in an unfamiliar midfield role, was pushed up to join Rooney in attack, where Di María had been stationed.\n\nThe formation – a quasi 4-2-2-2 – was a puzzle. Apart from the sight of Di María operating alongside the captain, Ashley Young was at left-back and Van Gaal could hardly have boosted the spirits of Van Persie by demoting his status for the day.\n\nBefore the match the manager claimed the striker was suffering a lack of confidence and this was illustrated before the break when he was clear in on Allan McGregor’s goal. Instead of slotting home with aplomb, as a Van Persie in form would, he merely dragged the effort straight to the keeper.\n\nStill, it was his smart touch that made United’s second. Juan Mata swept a diagonal ball to Herrera. The midfielder’s nod down went infield to the Dutchman and his lay-off was put ruthlessly beyond McGregor by Rooney.\n\nThis meant United were coasting when they entered the break. Earlier, Chris Smalling had given them the lead. A goalmouth scramble developed when Marouane Fellaini went for a header and after Smalling’s initial effort came back to Van Persie the latter’s attempt was repelled by McGregor and, this time, Smalling’s effort was adjudged to have crossed the goalline.\n\nSmalling, who had not scored since Boxing Day (also against Hull), came close to a second after neat work from the impressive Mata. The Spaniard collected the ball when it was returned to him from a free-kick and, with his weaker right foot, spun in a lovely cross that found the United No12. This time, though, Smalling’s attempt was deflected.\n\nThe manager was surely purring at half-time. Van Gaal may have informed his team to keep on as they had been, with much of the hard work done in the buildup, according to his own pre-game thoughts which offered insight into a meticulous work ethic.\n\n“My staff prepare thoroughly in the weeks leading up to a match,” Van Gaal said. “Information on the opposition is gathered so I know everything about them, about the individual players, about the substitutes who can come into the game, what the atmosphere in the stadium is like and how they kick the first ball of the match. Everything.\n\n“My analyst, Marcel Bout, goes to the matches of the opposing teams. He gives video clips of the games and his analysis to Ryan Giggs, who then turns all the information into a presentation which he then runs by me so I can make changes, if necessary.\n\n“Ryan will then present it to the players. The next day we evaluate our training sessions and we simulate our opponents in those sessions.”\n\nThis afternoon’s opponents started the second half by winning a free-kick. This was duly cleared by United, with Van Persie pivotal in helping kill the danger, which indicated his willingness to pitch in whatever his personal woes.\n\nA chief bugbear of Van Gaal before this game had been that United needed to turn in a display for the full 90 minutes. The sight, then, of Andrew Robertson, the visiting left-back, driving through a slumbering rearguard would not have pleased the Dutchman.\n\nRobertson’s eventual shot did not beat David de Gea but here was a warning all the same not to switch off as United have done too may times this term.\n\nAs the game aged, so did Van Persie, like a vintage wine. The 31-year-old skated past Michael Dawson and was felled so the defender went into the book of the referee, Anthony Taylor.\n\nNext came Van Persie’s moment. Herrera, who was enjoying his best match for United, intercepted a Robertson pass. He found Van Persie and, with a swish of that lethal left boot, the Dutchman placed a 20-yard peach past McGregor before, a little later, being replaced by Falcao.\n\nAt the end the Colombian missed from close in but it was all academic by then."}, {"date": "29/11/2014", "arena": "Kiyan Prince Foundation Stadium", "attendance": 18054, "home_team": {"name": "Queens Park Rangers", "lineup":

League after a thrilling match with 54 chances.\n\nThings started badly for Rangers when Esteban Cambiasso’s shot put Leicester ahead – the first goal the Foxes had scored since the 2-2 draw with Burnley on 4 October. QPR recovered to dominate the remainder of the first half and led at the break through a Wes Morgan own goal and a first Rangers goal for Leroy Fer. Nigel Pearson’s side hit back in the second half as Jeffrey Schlupp drew them level, only for Charlie Austin to hit his fifth goal in five games with 17 minutes remaining to settle the contest.\n\nHarry Redknapp said it was an important time to start picking up points, with their fellow strugglers Burnley, West Brom and Crystal Palace all visiting Loftus Road before the new year.\n\nThe QPR manager said: “It was an excellent performance. There was a lot of pressure on the game today. When you are stuck at the bottom you know that if you don’t win, even a draw, you come away and you are still cut adrift.\n\n“To get three points has put us right back in there again. There are about eight teams still down there in a relegation battle – you haven’t got to be that clever to pick them out, that is how it is going to be all year, but I feel we can get out of it.”\n\nRedknapp also praised the character of his squad and felt the win was a culmination of good work in recent games.\n\n“We came back,” he said. “We could have felt sorry for ourselves in that opening five minutes but we didn’t, we came back strong and we made lots of chances. It was an open, attacking game – an excellent game, I thought, with both teams going for it.\n\n“I felt the last five or six weeks that we have been playing very well. Like every manager I don’t feel like we got the points we deserved from those games. Certainly the Liverpool game here, Chelsea away and Man City – but we have been playing well.”\n\nHaving broken their goalscoring duck, Leicester still slipped to their fifth defeat in six games and replaced Rangers at the bottom of the table. Pearson said: “It was a game in which both sides tried to win and, unfortunately for us today, we didn’t win it.\n\n“What you could say about us today is that we were a bit wasteful at times. I thought our defenders played very well – that is not the reason we conceded goals.\n\n“We created enough chances to win it. Our defenders did all right, there were some great blocks in the first half and I thought we, as a defensive unit, were fine. We started well and created many chances. In many ways it was a game we should have won.”"}, {"date": "29/11/2014", "arena": "The Liberty Stadium", "attendance": 20240, "home_team": {"name": "Swansea City", "lineup": [{"name": "Lukasz

battled Swansea to a stalemate.\n\nNeil Warnock, 65 years young, still kicks every ball his players contest, and Saturday’s scrap bore his endlessly combative hallmark.\n\nThe Swans took an early lead with Wilfried Bony’s sixth goal in his past seven Premier League appearances, at which stage they seemed set for a routine win, but Palace dug deep and fought back in spirited fashion, their competitive resolve rewarded with the point gained by Mile Jedinak’s penalty.\n\nAs was the case last season, Palace possess the collective attitude needed to stay up. Swansea, however, have now dropped 13 points from winning positions and will need to play better against Queen’s Park Rangers on Tuesday night if they are to stay on track for a top-10 finish.\n\nGarry Monk, still short of his first anniversary as the Swans’ manager, preferred to “accentuate the positives”, as he put it. He said: “I’m looking at the 19 points we’ve got, which is a great total, rather than those we’ve lost. We’ve performed well in every game. We started this one very well, controlled the game and had our chances, but it wasn’t to be.”\n\nUnsurprisingly, Palace were unchanged after their uplifting victory over Liverpool last weekend – a much-needed result after taking one point from their previous five matches.\n\nSwansea settled quickly into their slick passing game, one typical early attack seeing Jefferson Montero accelerate to the byline on the left before delivering a cross that Bony touched over the bar.\n\nPalace were under pressure and conceded after a quarter of an hour when Gylfi Sigurdsson’s through ball enabled Bony to turn smartly in a central position, 15 yards out, before shooting with deadly precision into Julián Speroni’s right-hand corner.\n\nPalace’s cause was hardly helped by the loss of their leading scorer Dwight Gayle, whose leg injury forced him to give way to James McArthur.\n\nNevertheless they were level again after 25 minutes when their first attack of any consequence saw Shelvey bring down Marouane Chamakh in front of goal for Jedinak to make short work of the penalty.\n\nThey might even have taken the lead three minutes later when Lukasz Fabianski denied Chamakh in the act of shooting.\n\nYannick Bolasie’s strike from out on the left grazed the crossbar and, temporarily, the initiative had changed hands.\n\nMontero ought to have put that right before half-time, but shot tamely at Speroni with the time and space available in which to have done much better.\n\nDitto Shelvey who, alone in the six-yard box, volleyed horribly wide with the goal at his mercy.\n\nNothing if not persistent, Shelvey might have restored Swansea’s advantage early in the second half, but his volley was too close to Speroni’s body.\n\nIn contrast, Sigurdsson, with a volley of his own from the edge of the penalty area, tested the Palace goalkeeper’s reflexes to the full. The Icelander, shooting from left to right, was tantalisingly close to settling it.\n\nSwansea had plenty of possession and no shortage of scoring chances, but Palace defended assiduously throughout and deserved parity.\n\nWarnock said: “The first 20 minutes was as bad as I’ve seen us play. We couldn’t pass water and I was wondering if it was going to be double figures, but you have to give us credit – after that we gave as good as we got and might have pinched it.

For long spells, West Ham searched in vain for inspiration as they tried to find a way past Newcastle United’s defence and end a run of three matches without a win. There were crosses, runs and set pieces but nothing was working.\n\nSo, instead, they settled for a fluke, shading a tight game when Cheikhou Kouyaté’s scuffed shot somehow reached Aaron Cresswell, who scored his first West Ham goal. Sam Allardyce was not complaining about a victory that lifted his side into fifth place but there was a sense of what might have been for Alan Pardew after the end of Newcastle’s six-match winning streak. His side fought bravely after losing Moussa Sissoko to a late red card.\n\n“I have to give Aaron Cresswell a huge amount of credit,” Allardyce said. “He was quite lucky to get the chance but he never gave up on it.”\n\nNewcastle are a different proposition from the side that was such a mess a couple of months ago. Although their squad have been stretched to the limit by a massive injury list, there was plenty to admire about their approach work before they reached the final third and their pace made them dangerous on the break, with the surging runs of Sissoko reason for encouragement. Ayoze Pérez also troubled James Collins and James Tomkins with his nimble footwork and movement, although the West Ham centre-backs stuck to their task commendably.\n\nBoth sides were crying out for a cutting edge. Newcastle’s best chance arrived in the third minute when Pérez turned sharply in the area before firing wide of the right post, while West Ham lacked poise without the injured Alex Song, Diafra Sakho and Enner Valencia.\n\nThe temptation to seek out Andy Carroll with high, early balls was often too alluring for West Ham to resist but the striker’s main contribution in the first half was accidentally kicking Tomkins in the face. It revived memories of West Ham’s creativity crisis last season. Newcastle were coping even without their injured captain, Fabricio Coloccini, and a sign of West Ham’s frustration came when Cresswell slashed over from 30 yards early in the second half. Carroll and Stewart Downing both looked at the left-back with a mixture of anger and bemusement.\n\nCresswell held his hands up, shook his head and then made amends brilliantly by giving West Ham the lead in the 56th minute. Kouyaté’s mishit volley was not intended to reach Cresswell but he anticipated where it would fall and made the most of his good fortune with a slick finish past Rob Elliot with his left foot. Elliot, in goal for Newcastle because of Tim Krul’s ankle injury, had made only one save until that point but it was the break that West Ham needed, although not necessarily one they deserved.\n\nNewcastle felt aggrieved to be behind and their day went from bad to worse when Sissoko was sent off for two bookings. First he kicked the ball away when he was penalised for pushing Tomkins – the shove caused West Ham’s defender to handle in the area – and a minute later he was walking off after fouling Carroll. Pardew shook Sissoko’s hand as he left the pitch. “Moussa was frustrated,” Pardew said. “It’s not like Moussa. He has to learn from that but he isn’t a malicious player. He’s been absolutely superb.”\n\nWest Ham then missed a host of chances to wrap up the game and, in time-honoured fashion, did their best to throw it away.

Inspired by Lee Cattermole’s exceptional midfield dynamism and some impressive defending on John O’Shea’s part, the Wearsiders deserved their point but may feel they should have been celebrating an unlikely hat-trick on Saturday night.\n\nMourinho scrapped Chelsea’s Christmas party in the wake of his side’s League Cup quarter-final defeat here a year ago and, even worse for the Portuguese, Sunderland won at Stamford Bridge in the Premier League in April.\n\nFailure to exert proper revenge must have been galling but, by the time he faced the media, his technical area scowl had been replaced by an air of sanguine resignation.\n\n“Of course this year’s party’s still on,” said the Chelsea manager. “Sunderland defended very, very well. Some people, some football Einsteins, criticise defensive teams, they say defending is a crime but I don’t, they were playing for a clean sheet, they were successful in that objective and I praise them. We tried everything to win but we couldn’t win – and don’t forget we arrived home from Schalke at 5am in midweek.”\n\nPerhaps tiredness did catch up with his team because Chelsea began deceptively brightly with Willian, particularly, worrying Sunderland while also hitting a post with a first-half shot.\n\nAt that point Gus Poyet’s players were penned far too deep in their own half but, then, partway through the first half, came one of those moments on which matches can turn.\n\nLiberated by Cesc Fàbregas’s defence-bisecting pass from deep, Costa advanced with menace only to be denied by O’Shea’s excellent, immaculately timed, sliding tackle.\n\nGalvanised by that interception, Santiago Vergini cleverly deceived César Azpilicueta, enabling Jack Rodwell to test Thibaut Courtois from 30 yards. It was a routine save but marked the start of a proper contest.\n\nPoyet could have won prizes for moaning at referees during his days as a Chelsea player, but it was his assistant Mauricio Taricco who incurred Friend’s wrath here. Taricco was ordered down the tunnel, apparently sent off after complaining, somewhat vehemently, about Friend’s decisions to Lee Mason, the fourth official.\n\nMore positively, Connor Wickham’s highly effective deployment wide on the home left was giving Bransilav Ivanovic several uncomfortable moments and when Wickham stole in front of the right-back, his resultant cross forced Courtois into an uncharacterstically awkward punch. A little later Vergini met Cattermole’s deflected cross and lifted the ball imperiously over Courtois but also narrowly over the bar.\n\nIt was not Mourinho’s only cause for concern on an evening when Costa appeared lucky to escape unpunished after kicking out at O’Shea.\n\nAs if taking a growing dislike to the Ireland centre-half was not sufficient the much lauded striker could arguably count himself fortunate not to be sent off after appearing to accidentally on purpose catch Brown in the mouth with a flailing, non-leading arm as the pair challenged for a header.\n\nTo considerable local chagrin, Costa was merely booked – and, under the totting up rule, will consequently be suspended for Chelsea’s midweek game against Tottenham. “I don’t know,” said Mourinho when asked if he should have been dismissed. “I’ve been told he was unlucky to get a yellow.”\n\nDesperate to change the direction the game was taking, he subsequently replaced Costa and Oscar with Didier Drogba and Loïc Rémy but still the excellent Cattermole- (Roy Hodgson surely has to issue him an England summons) - kept destroying their previously assured passing rhythm.\n\nWhen Jozy Altidore’s cross was deflected to Johnson’s feet, time momentarily stood still. It was a highly inviting chance but the winger, on his weaker foot, directed the ensuing shot fractionally the wrong side of a post before covering his face with his hands.\n\nNot that his manager was overly dismayed at the end of an evening that left John Terry bristling with barely concealed aggression. “We need to be pleased with a point,” said Poyet. “We’ve stopped Chelsea scoring for the first time this season. It would have taken something very special from them to beat us.”"}, {"date": "24/11/2014", "arena": "Villa Park", "attendance": 25311, "home_team": {"name": "Aston Villa", "lineup": [{"name": "Brad

long periods it looked like the form book would be turned on its head on a bitterly cold evening in the West Midlands but Nathaniel Clyne, Southampton’s man of the moment, enhanced his burgeoning reputation with a well-taken goal nine minutes from time to earn Ronald Koeman’s side a point.\n\nIt was no more than Southampton deserved on an evening when the apathy at Aston Villa plumbed new depths. Only 25,311 turned up – Villa’s lowest crowd in the Premier League for 15 years – and those that stayed at home had no cause to regret their decision. It was a desperately poor match. Even watching on television must have been an ordeal.\n\nVilla, who managed to arrive for a home fixture late after their coach got stuck in what Paul Lambert described as “horrendous traffic”, took the lead from their only shot on target. It came about after a rare mistake from Fraser Forster, who dashed out of his area for a ball that he had no chance of getting. Gabriel Agbonlahor was not going to pass up an early Christmas present and gratefully accepted the Southampton goalkeeper’s gift, toe-poking the ball past him before slotting home. It was Agbonlahor’s third league goal of the season and Villa’s sixth in total.\n\nThe home side spent much of the remainder of the game clinging on to their lead, defending in numbers, counter-attacking sporadically and generally frustrating a Southampton team who had plenty of possession but lacked the craft and guile to break down a patched-up Villa defence.\n\nYet despite being on the back foot, Villa could easily have grabbed a second that might well have killed the game when Agbonlahor, following a swift raid up field, set up Andreas Weimann. The Austrian blazed his shot over the bar and the significance of that moment became clear two minutes later, when Southampton levelled.\n\nIt was a goal that summed up Southampton’s attacking ethos under Koeman and provided a measure of Clyne’s self-belief. Ryan Bertrand, who was on loan at Villa during the second half of last season, got forward on the left and cut the ball back for Clyne, who timed his run so perfectly that he did not need to break his stride before sweeping a fine first-time shot, from just inside the penalty area, into the far corner of the net.\n\nFollowing his England debut against Slovenia and another impressive performance against Scotland four days later, it has been quite a fortnight for Clyne all in all. “One of his qualities is to play offensive, he has that freedom from the coach and it was an important goal,” Koeman said. “In my opinion he is the best right full-back in the Premier League.”\n\nFor Koeman, however, this was a result tinged with disappointment. Southampton, with 11 wins from their previous 12 matches, would have hoped to continue their excellent form against a Villa side missing key personnel and desperately short of confidence. Not that Koeman has lost any of his optimism about what his team, still two points ahead of Manchester City in second place, can achieve this season. “After 37 games I don’t believe we will still be second in the table. But we might be third,” the Southampton manager said.\n\nAlthough Southampton’s attacking players struggled to make much of an impression, credit must also go to Villa’s makeshift but resolute central defensive partnership of Jores Okore, who was making his first club appearance in 14 months, and Ciaran Clark. “I thought the two young centre-backs were outstanding,” said Lambert, who was celebrating his 100th game in charge of Villa."}, {"date": "23/11/2014", "arena": "Selhurst Park", "attendance": 24862, "home_team": {"name": "Crystal Palace", "lineup": [{"name": "Julian Speroni",

the fight appeared to have drained out of Brendan Rodgers in the aftermath. The Liverpool manager mumbled through his post-match assessment as he struggled to comprehend another damaging result, his team’s spluttering campaign sinking ever further into the mire. While he offered up a few defiant words, stressing the need for immediate improvement with a cluttered schedule upon his team, his downbeat delivery said more.\n\nAs telling was his admission that, even after last season’s rapid development and near miss in terms of the title race, he cannot count himself immune from dismissal. This campaign’s more onerous workload, with the added demand of Champions League football and tighter scope for domestic improvement, is taking its toll.\n\n“That was bitterly disappointing,” he admitted, “and it’s my responsibility as the manager, ultimately. Overall, that intensity and togetherness in our game isn’t there.” His side are saddled with a minus goal difference and languish closer to the relegation zone than the top four. They were outfought here by a Crystal Palace side who started the match below the cut-off. That is damning in itself.\n\nThis performance was arguably more troubling than the infamous late capitulation in May. Back in spring, dismayed by that damaging home loss to Chelsea a few days earlier, the visitors’ thinking had been muddled in pursuit of inflating their goal difference, all focus blurred and panic gripping over a madcap 11-minute period in the contest’s finale. Here they led within 90 seconds against a team whose fragility has been all too clear this term, and still contrived to wilt almost apologetically.\n\nThe plight of those across their back-line rather summed them up: Dejan Lovren and Martin Skrtel are diminished in the centre, their vulnerability exposed by Dwight Gayle and Marouane Chamakh; both full-backs were flummoxed throughout by the pace on Palace’s flanks; the goalkeeper, Simon Mignolet, is bereft of confidence, with his every error punished.\n\nYannick Bolasie, all elastic limbs and blistering pace, illuminated this occasion, with his extravagant skill striking terror into his markers. It had been his shot which skimmed across Mignolet and on to the far post just after the quarter-hour mark, Gayle converting the rebound smartly on his first league start since mid-September, and his flick over Lovren was thumped through the goalkeeper by Joe Ledley to thrust the hosts ahead. Bolasie returned from DR Congo only on Thursday after scoring a brace to propel his country to the Africa Cup of Nations. Sensing his opportunity, he had been irrepressible until replaced late on. “He doesn’t know what he’s going to do next,” said Neil Warnock, “so the full-back doesn’t have a chance, does he?”\n\nMile Jedinak belted in a third from a 25-yard free-kick and, while Liverpool could complain over the softness of that award, they still ended bedraggled and well beaten. There was no obvious plan to their approach, short of tapping into the understanding enjoyed by Adam Lallana and Rickie Lambert from their Southampton days.\n\nThat combination had earned them the lead, the England striker’s first Liverpool goal converted slickly to suggest a cakewalk ahead. But the visitors were stodgy in their approach thereafter, all that zest from last term a faint memory, offering neither width in attack nor zip through the middle. The post-match statistics suggested both Steven Gerrard and Skrtel had not won a single tackle, with Jedinak the most authoritative midfielder on the pitch and Ledley snapping at his side.\n\nPalace should have scored more, so eagerly did they wrest back the initiative after that poor start, with Liverpool wincing at the ferocity of the home side’s breaks upfield. Jason Puncheon recaptured last year’s form – his combinations with Bolasie cutting Rodgers’ side apart, and there was no one among the visitors’ ranks to stamp authority on the occasion.\n\n“We can’t complain,” said their manager, whose side have won only twice in nine Premier League matches. “We’d hoped to build on the last two years but we need to get back to basics, to get back to fighting and working hard.” This smacked of a surrender.\n\nMan of the match Yannick Bolasie (Crystal Palace)"}, {"date": "23/11/2014", "arena": "KCOM Stadium", "attendance": 23561, "home_team": {"name": "Hull

It was that of Gastón Ramírez five minutes into the second period as he kicked out at Jan Vertonghen in a manner reminiscent of David Beckham towards Diego Simeone at the 1998 World Cup.\n\nWith Ramírez, only playing because the hosts’ top scorer, Mohamed Diamé, was suffering from a bout of tendinitis in a knee and who featured for Mauricio Pochettino at Southampton last season, went the home team’s attacking threat and the Hull manager, Steve Bruce, accused Vertonghen of cheating over his part in the incident.

Who knows what the outcome would have been with 11 but I am sure we would have stood a better chance. For me, the whole spectacle was ruined because of that incident.\n\n“There is no doubt that Ramírez has shown petulance; Vertonghen has a little go at him and provokes him and he flicks out. The letter of the law says it is violent conduct. But the reason the Premier League is loved around the world is the honesty of it, the integrity of it and the ferocity of it.”\n\nAlthough neutrals might not have agreed with Bruce’s assessment, neither would they necessarily have shared Pochettino’s opinion that the numerical advantage was not pivotal in his latest comeback win. Before victory at Aston Villa on their last road trip, a Pochettino team had not overturned a deficit during his time in England.\n\n“No, I don’t think it had a big impact,” said the Argentinian. “At the beginning of the second half our game was better than Hull. I am sure that at the end it would have been the same result.”\n\nA side showing six changes – Emmanuel Adebayor was among those to miss out through injury – trailed to their former midfielder Jake Livermore’s eighth-minute opener. Seizing on a headed clearance from Federico Fazio, Livermore exploited the reluctance of Ben Davies to close him down as he approached the area and guided a precision effort beyond Hugo Lloris’s dive.\n\nBut for Lloris the half-time deficit could have been greater, with Robbie Brady denied by a fine reaction save and another stop from Ramírez’s angled drive resulting in Hatem Ben Arfa curling the rebound wide. At the other end Spurs did not test the returning Allan McGregor until five minutes before the break when Erik Lamela’s shot was beaten away.\n\nTraffic in the home area increased immeasurably, however, once it became 10 versus 11. Hull’s exercise in stealth had limited Tottenham to Harry Kane’s equaliser on the hour, turned in instinctively from 10 yards after the elfish Eriksen’s free-kick was redirected into his path via the post and the unwitting McGregor’s sprawling frame.\n\nHull reshaped, sacrificing the mercurial skills of Ben Arfa and the passing range of the booked Tom Huddlestone. But the dam was cruelly burst as the clock hit the 90-minute mark and Eriksen ghosted across the fringe of the penalty area to bend his shot inside the far post.\n\nTo the glass half-fullers among Spurs fans it extended Tottenham’s happy knack of purloining late points on the road. To the half-empties it is papering over the cracks. But also spare a thought for Hull who have given up seven points in the last 10 minutes of matches and now sit two places above the relegation zone as a consequence.\n\nMan of the match Christian

are rising that the Premier League title race could become one long Chelsea lap of honour. Their latest outing was never a contest, just a parade of power and style. They have now won 10 and drawn two of their 12 league matches this season, racking up points at an ominous rate. The other so-called title challengers need to find consistency soon or it will be too late.\n\nAs for West Bromwich Albion, they presented themselves for kick-off on time but that was pretty much all they got right in a first half when the result was effectively decided, although Ben Foster’s constant saves stopped the scoreline from testifying to the true extent of the home team’s superiority. The Baggies tightened up admirably in the second period, by which time they were down to 10 men due to the expulsion of Claudio Yacob, but that was partially because Chelsea eased off.\n\nThe hosts corralled the visitors into one end of the pitch from the opening seconds and did not relent until their opponents had abandoned all hope of winning a point. Which was around about half-time.\n\n“The first half was brilliant, beautiful,” said José Mourinho. “Our football was high quality, another dimension. We were playing so well, so fast, so fluid. We made the pitch very wide and created spaces to play inside and scored two goals. We should have scored much more than that. It was fantastic.”\n\nIt really was. Chelsea hogged possession with purpose, probing mischievously from the outset and spreading panic amid the visitors. Yacob managed to curtail one attack in the fifth minute but was too flustered to do anything with the ball other than boot it behind for a corner. Chelsea took it short, Eden Hazard fizzed the ball across the face of goal and John Terry tried to poke it into the net, bringing the first of Foster’s many saves.\n\nThe goalkeeper was by far Albion’s busiest player, with many of the others acting like puzzled bystanders as Chelsea breezed between them. But he was helpless in the 11th minute when Oscar clipped a cross over to Diego Costa, who, as the defenders appealed justifiably for offside, killed the ball on his chest before finishing in typically deadly fashion from 12 yards.\n\nSoon Foster had to excel again, pushing away an Oscar shot with one hand after the Brazilian had been left free on the edge of the area to receive a pull-back from Hazard. Foster had to scramble to his feet to prevent Costa from scoring on the rebound, no defender having anticipated the problem.\n\nAfter Chelsea’s last Premier League home match, against QPR, Mourinho had complained that the subdued atmosphere made it seem like supporters were sleeping; here, the Albion manager, Alan Irvine, could have levelled similar complaints at his defenders in the first half. At least Chris Baird had an excuse for looking out of his depth. He was making his first Premier League start for 658 days following injury and loss of form and his rustiness was exposed by Branislav Ivanovic in the 19th minute when the Serb raced past him and crossed for Costa, who shot inches wide.\n\nAlbion were guilty of more doziness in the 25th minute, when Hazard was allowed to receive a short corner from Cesc Fàbregas and fire the ball into the net from close range, Craig Gardner’s attempted block coming too late to be successful.\n\nThe way things were unfolding made a repeat of Chelsea’s 6-0 win in 2010 a strong possibility. Especially when Yacob was sent off for what can only be described as a pogo-tackle – the midfielder jumped with two feet into a challenge with Costa and although he landed on the ball, the referee, Lee Mason, deemed it dangerous, a decision that Irvine agreed was “understandable”.\n\nEnjoying numerical superiority on top of a lead that was palpably insurmountable, Chelsea players began to showboat, Oscar drawing another save from Foster with a backheeled shot from seven yards.\n\nThe home side should have been farther in front before the break as the Albion defence dissolved every time the hosts turned up the heat. Fàbregas prodded a pass straight through the middle of them in the 40th minute, allowing Ivanovic to rush on to it and, as Foster advanced, knock the ball sideways to Azpilicueta. The pass was fractionally too long for the Spaniard but the fact that both of Chelsea’s full-backs had got behind the defence in the box spoke volumes. Nemanja Matic enjoyed similar freedom in the opening minutes of the second period but directed a volley over the bar from 10 yards after being fed by Fàbregas.\n\nWith an important Champions League tie to play at Schalke on Tuesday, Chelsea relaxed a little, though Foster had to maintain his vigilance to thwart Hazard and Costa again. In the end Irvine could claim a degree of satisfaction from avoiding a massacre.\n\nThe supporters did their best to keep the atmosphere buzzing until full-time but Chelsea’s contentedness with their lead and Albion’s inability to do anything about it meant the game had an almost non-event feel by the end."}, {"date": "22/11/2014", "arena": "Goodison Park", "attendance": 39182, "home_team":

his enduring quality. The midfielder joined the elite band of players who have represented the Merseyside club 400 times and marked the occasion in suitable style.\n\nHis winner was a reminder that, over 11 years in the Everton team, he has forged a reputation as a goalscoring midfielder. His intelligence accounts for his ability to find space and it was apparent again. Deputising for the injured Gareth Barry as one of the holding midfielders, Osman was a stranger to the West Ham box until he timed his foray forward perfectly.\n\n“He was marshalling the back four and dictating the play so the last player you expect on a counterattack was Leon Osman,” said his manager, Roberto Martínez. Yet when Romelu Lukaku released Samuel Eto’o and he showed the presence of mind to spot the runner at the far post, Osman materialised to produce an assured finish.\n\n“He is a great ambassador for our football club,” Martínez said. “He was outstanding throughout the game.” His eulogies were not confined to his own players. “I want to praise the referee,” Martínez added. “I really enjoyed his performance.” In particular, he approved of Mark Clattenburg’s decision to play on when James Collins upended Lukaku with a rather crude challenge seconds before Osman struck. Yet both Everton goals had input from the officials. Lukaku scored the opener, two minutes after a glaring miss from Steven Naismith, by capitalising after Winston Reid blocked Ross Barkley’s shot. “It falls to Lukaku who is two yards offside,” complained the West Ham manager, Sam Allardyce. “That decision baffled me so we have to be frustrated.” Having had a conversation with Clattenburg, he will contact the referees’ chief Mike Riley in search of an explanation.\n\nMeanwhile Martínez appreciated Clattenburg’s leniency. One melee followed a challenge on Morgan Amalfitano by James McCarthy, who almost scored with a curling shot. Another, when Kevin Mirallas fouled the Frenchman, ended with the Belgian pushing James Tomkins in the chest and the defender collapsing histrionically, holding his face. “Kevin just tries to push him away; it is not a slap or a punch,” said Martínez, arguing a caution was a proportionate punishment. Allardyce was succinct and scathing. “It was handbags,” he said. “Gucci.”\n\nYet West Ham played an altogether less fashionable and more direct brand of football, Allardyce putting their aesthetic overhaul on hold and reverting to a direct gameplan featuring an old-school assortment of six-footers. However, it amounted to a pragmatic response to injury problems as he was deprived of five of his six premier midfielders and forwards. Even the lone survivor, Mark Noble, limped off after a challenge from Naismith that upset Allardyce.\n\nNecessity proved the mother of reinvention. Andy Carroll troubled Everton with his aerial dominance. Allardyce began with a back five and then, in a game of influential substitutions, brought West Ham back into contention with a double change and a switch of system. One of the arrivals, Mauro Zárate, levelled after five minutes on the pitch, even if his shot required a telling deflection off Phil Jagielka to defeat Tim Howard. West Ham were in the ascendant then, Howard making a vital save to deny Amalfitano and another replacement, Matt Jarvis, fizzing a shot into the side-netting.\n\nYet Martínez, who contributed to many an Everton win last season with a mid-match reshuffle, repeated the feat. On came Eto’o and his manager said: “He was the reason for the win.” Nevertheless, it took a brilliant stop from Howard to prevent Collins from scoring a second equaliser for West Ham. “Our finishing was not good enough,” Allardyce complained. “If we had got a point, based on our injury situation, I would have been very happy.”"}, {"date": "22/11/2014", "arena": "The King Power Stadium",

The City goalkeeper, Kasper Schmeichel, made a fine block, as he did a few minutes later when Johnson’s long-range shot gathered pace off the wet surface.\n\nThe second half was all effort but depressingly little quality, though Matty James, bursting into the penalty area but unable to beat the Sunderland goalkeeper Costel Pantilimon, will feel he should have secured a win for City, while Mahrez, having left Wes Brown on the floor, saw a low shot diverted wide.\n\n“We need to play like that more often, and if we do we’ll be all right,” said Pearson. “We created chances, worked their goalkeeper, and I think we were the better side, but it didn’t quite go our way. On another day we’d have won the game.”\n\nWith Chelsea, Manchester City and Liverpool on the horizon, Poyet appeared content. “It was a typical game between teams in our positions, but we’re back to being a difficult team to play against, which is good. A clean sheet was the best part of the game for us.\n\n”They went back to the shape which worked for them at the start of the season, two up front, two wide, and tried to pin us back but after the first 20 minutes we brought the craziness of the game down and I wasn’t really worried we’d concede. We’ll play worse than that and win, that’s for sure.\n\n“We’re trying to get back to basics,” said the Uruguayan, and in that respect, it was a case of objective achieved."}, {"date": "22/11/2014",

defending champions were labouring in the second half and looking short of attacking ideas. With David Silva still injured and Sergio Agüero having a quiet game City’s attempts to stay in touch with Chelsea at the top of the Premier League were not amounting to much until their influential midfielder suddenly found the energy for one of his trademark bursts into the area.\n\nTouré had not been having a particularly impressive game up until that point, and when he is below his best City usually are too, but when Fernandinho set him up with a nonchalant back heel into the area just after the hour mark there was no stopping the Ivorian.\n\nStorming into the area Touré latched on to the ball and placed a low shot into Lukasz Fabianski’s bottom corner almost without breaking stride. It was Touré’s first league goal of the season at the Etihad, an indication of how out of sorts he has been, and only once in front did City show the sort of attacking confidence and expansiveness they will need to have any hope of catching Chelsea.\n\nCity could not add to their lead in the half-hour or so that remained, though only through Fabianski’s excellence in keeping out a late effort from Jesús Navas. At least they looked as if they believed in themselves and knew the way to goal, a vast improvement on the first half, and they must find a way of keeping the same momentum going to have any chance against Bayern Munich on Tuesday, when Touré will be suspended. They also need to work on their concentration in defence.\n\nYaya Touré scores Man City’s second goal past Swansea’s Lucasz Fabianski in the Premier League at the Etihad. Photograph: Martin Rickett/PA\n\nImproved though City were in the second half, they might still have been pegged back at the end when Swansea came agonisingly close with a deflected free kick, or when Wilfried Bony played Bafétimbi Gomis through on goal. Joe Hart came out quickly and did just enough to put off the substitute, though a more experienced striker would have made more of the opportunity. City must have been relieved it was not Gomis playing in Bony, for Swansea’s main striker had already shown his finishing prowess in the opening minutes.\n\n“If we had scored a third goal it might have made the last five minutes easier,” Manuel Pellegrini said. “But considering we started off a goal down we played well and created a lot of chances. Defending is something we work every day to improve, and I hope we don’t make the same sort of mistakes when we face a difficult team like Bayern Munich.”\n\nThe home side had got off to an uncertain start when Swansea took the lead with a goal against the run of play after nine minutes. It was not that City had been piling on the pressure at the other end, they had not, but the visitors had shown little attacking endeavour until Bony and Nathan Dyer combined neatly for the former to find plenty of space in which to beat Hart. Bony supplied Dyer in the first place then moved forward, Dyer delayed the return pass until just the right moment for his team-mate to stay onside, then picked up his run with the deftest of chipped diagonal passes. The defence could only watch as Bony brought the ball down then turned to shoot past the goalkeeper.\n\nIt was not the show of strength Pellegrini had been looking for pre-Bayern, but City remained calm and stuck to their task of gradually wearing Swansea down. They drew level midway through the first half when after a patient build-up, Touré supplied Navas on the right, and Stevan Jovetic just about stayed onside to flick a teasing cross beyond Fabianski.\n\nBy the interval the Swansea goalkeeper was keeping his side in it. He showed quick reactions on the half-hour to deny Agüero when a great ball from Samir Nasri had put him through on goal, then on the stroke of half-time his outstretched fingertips pushed a tremendous 30 yard drive from Gaël Clichy on to his left upright.\n\nA couple of more routine saves, both from Jovetic, ensured the teams turned round level, though Swansea were possibly lucky to start the second half with the same number of players as City after an incident on the half-hour when Kyle Bartley appeared to strike Agüero. The two players came together well away from the ball, so the referee understandably failed to see what happened, but Agüero first fell to the ground, then got up angrily to confront Àngel Rangel. That appeared to be a case of mistaken identity, if a foul had taken place Bartley was the culprit, and the Swansea defender had already been booked for a challenge on the same player.\n\n“This is a hard place to come and that’s the closest we’ve been to a result,” Garry Monk said. “Considering we were relegation favourites at the start of the season we are not doing so bad. We had to do some last-ditch defending in the second half when City got going, but we had chances of our own at the end. We could possibly have taken a point.”"}, {"date": "22/11/2014", "arena": "St James' Park, Newcastle", "attendance": 51915, "home_team": {"name": "Newcastle United", "lineup": [{"name": "Tim Krul",

"Harry Redknapp has long admired Moussa Sissoko, but he could have done without the France midfielder illuminating the Tyneside dusk by scoring Newcastle United’s winning goal, on a day that left Queens Park Rangers bottom of the Premier League.\n\nA couple of months ago, Alan Pardew found himself in a similarly worrying fix, but six straight victories – five in the Premier League – have resulted in Newcastle’s relegation fears being replaced by European ambitions.\n\nAt the final whistle, Pardew’s side stood fourth in the table, but, by then, his joy had been clouded by Ryan Taylor’s bad luck. For just over 30 minutes, the afternoon belonged to Taylor, making his first Premier League start for two and a half years after two cruciate ligament injuries, as he shone in midfield. Sometimes breaking up play effectively from a central role, sometimes unnerving QPR courtesy of expert dead-ball delivery, he played like a man who had never been away. As Pardew put it: “Ryan was pulling the strings.”\n\nThen he went down. The physio arrived, manipulated the player’s knee, and immediately extended a consolatory arm. Eventually, Taylor got to his feet and limped off to a standing ovation, tears streaming down his face.\n\n“We’re sweating on Ryan,” said Pardew. “He doesn’t deserve another trauma. Fortunately, his surgeon, Richard Steadman, was here in the stands. He’d flown over from America to watch Ryan play and he’s gone to the hospital with him. It means the win is tinged with sadness, but we’ve just got to keep our fingers crossed.”\n\nRedknapp, who later lost Sandro, another midfielder with a history of cruciate-repair surgery, to a similar, potentially serious knee problem, sympathised. “It’s very sad for Ryan Taylor,” he said. “And it doesn’t look too clever for Sandro either.”\n\nIt all rather put a blight on a contest in which Rob Green had, earlier, tipped Taylor’s chip over the bar after Rémy Cabella’s outswinging corner and Jack Colback’s clever decoy run.\n\nThen, with Redknapp’s side increasingly fazed by Newcastle’s counterattacking pace, Ayoze Pérez sped clear, Cabella threw in some penalty-area trickery, and Taylor’s shot forced Green into a decent save.\n\nThe tears came soon afterwards, and things did not really get going again until the second half, when Pérez and co threw everything at Steven Caulker and Richard Dunne. Undeterred, QPR clung on, edging closer to claiming their hitherto elusive first away point of this Premier League campaign. “We looked solid without being creative,” said Redknapp.\n\nAware that injuries had deprived Pardew of, among others, his key defender Fabricio Coloccini, QPR’s manager had switched from 4-5-1 to 4-4-2. On paper, the attacking combination of Bobby Zamora and Charlie Austin spelled danger – but, all too often, that duo was left chasing long balls and lost causes.\n\nA byproduct of such tactics was a diminution of Joey Barton’s effectiveness in midfield. This proved a relatively quiet return to Newcastle for Barton – although he was quick to argue the toss when the referee, Chris Foy, quite reasonably, ticked off Zamora for clattering Colback with an elbow. There was also a minor contretemps with Cabella, but, largely, Barton concentrated on holding QPR together, improving significantly after being shifted from the right to central midfield.\n\nBy then, Redknapp sensed things “drifting to a decent point”, but, suddenly, Sissoko – who, by way of vindicating the QPR manager’s judgement, had already established himself as the key performer – exchanged passes with the impressive Sammy Ameobi, meeting the latter’s dink with a shot into the top corner.\n\nAlthough Barton enjoyed the last word – clearing Papiss Cissé’s shot off the line – even he could not silence the triumphant choruses of Blaydon Races."}, {"date": "22/11/2014", "arena": "Bet365 Stadium", "attendance": 27018, "home_team": {"name": "Stoke City", "lineup": [{"name": "Asmir Begovic",

"Burnley’s resurgence continued as a quickfire brace early on from Danny Ings secured a win that took them off the bottom of the Premier League table.\n\nSean Dyche’s men had claimed their first victory of the season in their last outing by defeating Hull 1-0 at home, and they looked determined from the off to add three more points again, with Ings taking advantage of sloppy play from the Potters to tuck in from close range in the 12th and 13th minutes.\n\nJonathan Walters pulled a goal back for the home side in the 32nd minute and Burnley had to withstand plenty of pressure as the game continued. But they held out for a win that sees them rise to 18th in the table, below 17th-placed Leicester on goal difference alone. Meanwhile, Stoke – also beaten at home by Leicester and Aston Villa this term – drop a place to 10th.\n\nDyche had stressed after the Hull win the importance of building on that result and it certainly seemed those words had been absorbed by his players in the opening stages as the visitors raced into a two-goal lead.\n\nOn an individual level, those strikes also marked a continuation of momentum for Ings, who had scored twice for England Under-21s at his home ground Turf Moor during the international break.\n\nBut it was notable as well, as Burnley’s top-scorer from their 2013-14 promotion campaign notched his second and third goals for them this term, that Stoke – without the injured Marc Wilson and Erik Pieters in defence – had provided him with a significant helping hand for each goal.\n\nFirst, Marc Muniesa lost the ball and in the move that followed, Asmir Begovic’s parry from Ashley Barnes’s cross teed Ings up nicely for a slotted finish.\n\nThen, just over a minute and a half later, Burnley’s former Stoke man Michael Kightly got the better of Phil Bardsley and had the space to burst forward down the left and cross to an unmarked Ings, who once again despatched the chance.\n\nWith the away support going wild, George Boyd looked to add another goal, sending an attempt from outside the box into Begovic’s arms.\n\nStoke then began to get into the game, with the lively Bojan Krkic having a shot deflected wide. Soon after, the Spaniard provided the delivery that Walters converted with a diving header, goalkeeper Tom Heaton getting a hand to the effort but unable to keep it out.\n\nVictor Moses – he of the recent diving “cheat” accusations from Swansea’s Garry Monk – then had penalty claims waved away after going down in the box in a questionable-looking manner, before curling in a shot that Heaton palmed away.\n\nStoke’s quest for an equaliser continued after the break as Moses skewed wide and Mame Biram Diouf just failed to meet a delightful Bojan cross properly with his head, and the referee Martin Atkinson dismissed Potters claims that Kieran Trippier had handballed in the penalty area.\n\nMoses then departed the field clutching his thigh, Marko Arnautovic coming on in his place, before Steven N’Zonzi sent the ball over Heaton’s bar from a cut-back to the edge of the area.\n\nWhile Mark Hughes looked convinced Burnley were taking every opportunity to eat up more minutes, he will also have been frustrated by his own side’s further exertions not yielding a goal, with a couple of attempts from substitute Charlie Adam proving unsuccessful.\n\nBurnley held firm with some brave defending and might have even scored a third goal during the closing stages as Begovic denied the substitute Lukas Jutkiewicz.\n\nBurnley were still not out of danger, with Begovic joining the action at that end and missing the last real opportunity, heading off-target from a corner."}, {"date": "22/11/2014", "arena": "Emirates Stadium", "attendance": 60074, "home_team": {"name": "Arsenal",

“Enough is enough,” was the message, and these are the moments when it feels like the mutiny is growing and it is not entirely clear how Arsenal’s manager can pacify the people who want a change. The malaise feels too deep and the gap to Chelsea at the top of the Premier League is more accurately described as a gulf, now 15 points and climbing.\n\nIt is no wonder the “Wenger Out” camp has found its voice again, no matter how unappealing it is to see the abuse a fine man has to suffer.\n\nBriefly, there was a ceasefire after the fit-again Olivier Giroud, on as a late substitute, let fly to score with a wonderfully taken shot that was still rising as it flew into the net. That, however, was four minutes into stoppage time and the volume went back up again at the final whistle.\n\nArsenal had taken an awfully long time getting past a vulnerable Manchester United defence and it was not enough for Wenger to argue that fortune deserted his team.\n\nThat was not bad luck when Wojciech Szczesny went to punch a cross and crashed into his team-mate Kieran Gibbs in the chain of errors that led to United’s opening goal. Granted, there was a considerable amount of luck attached to what happened next when Antonio Valencia’s off-target shot skimmed off Gibbs, still on the floor, to find the net but the thwack between goalkeeper and left-back was just another indication of the chaos that frequently undermines Arsenal’s defence.\n\nThe frailties were there again when United, defending a corner, broke from the edge of their own penalty area and Arsenal’s back four had gone awol as Wayne Rooney clipped a stylish finish into the net.\n\nWenger admitted afterwards that he was mystified why they had left only one defender at the back and it was the same again shortly afterwards when Ángel Di Maria burst free only to try something similar and chip wide.\n\nArsenal have now won only one of their last 15 games against these opponents and the most galling part of this one was that it was against a team that had Tyler Blackett, Paddy McNair and Chris Smalling making up the defence, in a return to the 3-4-1-2 system that most United followers must have hoped had been seen off in conker season.\n\nIt was a scratch team and Arsenal really ought to have done more to exploit it during an opening half an hour when they did at least remind us of their ability to play quick, penetrative football.\n\nThey were ultimately undone by their own wastefulness and what Wenger described, amid suffocating deja vu, as “naive” defending. It has been the recurring theme in a season that has brought them only four wins in the league, all against sides currently in the bottom seven.\n\nSzczesny was forced off with a sore hip after the collision with Gibbs and Wenger looked notably unsympathetic when he reported it was merely a bang. He will, however, be far more anxious about a worryingly early departure for Jack Wilshere, who limped off in the 55th minute after a crashing tackle from McNair connected with one of his weakened ankles.\n\nWilshere had been fortunate in the first half to avoid what by modern-day standards could easily have been a red-card offence, taking exception to one of Mike Dean’s decisions, aiming a mouthful of invective at the referee and then responding to Marouane Fellaini’s indignation by jutting his forehead into his opponent’s chin.\n\nThe suspicion was that he was more aggrieved with himself than anyone else, having just squandered the outstanding chance of the first 45 minutes. Danny Welbeck will also reflect on his own chances. Welbeck was lively against his old club but his accuracy rate hardly blew apart Louis van Gaal’s theory that the striker lacks refinement.\n\nYet United were on the rails for most of the opening half, bar some sporadic, brief flashes of danger when Di María was on the ball. Robin van Persie is no longer the player the Arsenal crowd used to fear so much on previous United visits and Van Gaal gave the impression afterwards that he had been unsparing in his criticisms at half-time.\n\nPerhaps most surprisingly, he stubbornly refused to praise David de Gea, saying only that the goalkeeper had many qualities but needed to improve. Manchester United’s manager is a hard man to please: De Gea had been crucial to this win.\n\nUnited, like Arsenal, looked like faded old champions but, for all the hairy moments earlier on, they defended with great vigour once they had taken the lead. They also had to contend with Luke Shaw twisting his ankle early on and Van Gaal said afterwards that the long list of injuries – staggeringly, there have been 40 of them in his four months at the club – had made it virtually impossible for him to keep to his usual ethos of playing roughly the same team every week.\n\nIn the circumstances, their second-half display represented their best work of a difficult season. Rooney’s goal was the result of quick, incisive counter-attacking starting with Fellaini deep inside his own half and culminating in Di María playing in United’s captain to dink a shot over Emiliano Martínez, Arsenal’s substitute goalkeeper.\n\nGiroud’s finish was even better but it was not long before the dissent could be heard around Wenger’s dugout again."}, {"date": "09/11/2014", "arena":

Perhaps Adam Johnson’s enduring struggle to recapture his elusive form should be held partly responsible? Or might it simply have been a case of the disappointing Romelu Lukaku leaving his shooting boots on Merseyside?\n\nFor whatever reason, it took a pair of set pieces, calmly dispatched by Sebastian Larsson and Leighton Baines, to ensure the match did not end goalless.\n\nA game which left Gareth Barry with a badly injured ankle began in deceptively promising fashion. While Connor Wickham – deployed wide on the left and ruffling Seamus Coleman – headed one corner wide and another over, Everton also spurned an inviting chance. When Samuel Eto’o and Lukaku exchanged passes Sunderland’s defence was deceived but Eto’o’s shot from the edge of the area proved wild and wide.\n\nEveryone, and Barry especially, could have done without the interruption prompted when Jordi Gómez tripped the Everton midfielder, then seemed, accidentally, to tread on him. Gómez swiftly saw yellow but several minutes passed before was carried off on a stretcher, his injured leg in a brace, and taken to hospital. “Gareth’s having x-rays,” Roberto Martínez said. “Unfortunately he was just stretching his leg out when he went down.”\n\nGómez featured in much of Sunderland’s best work and his deft pass to the overlapping left-back Anthony Réveillère (deputising for Patrick van Aanholt, who is to have shoulder surgery and will be out until February) resulted in Sylvain Distin desperately scrambling Réveillère’s ensuing cross-shot to safety.\n\nAlthough Tim Howard smartly diverted Gómez’s low shot after Sunderland’s Spanish midfielder caught Darron Gibson loitering in possession, he was later lucky to escape a second yellow card for simulation after appearing to dive in Everton’s box in the face of minimal contact from Phil Jagielka.\n\nOverall Martínez’s side saw more of the ball and generally manipulated it better, leaving Gus Poyet’s players looking distinctly nervous whenever Aiden McGeady and Ross Barkley ran at them.\n\nImpressive as John O’Shea proved in Sunderland’s defence, mystery surrounded the manner in which menacing visiting attacks persistently foundered inside the area as a litany of ill-judged final balls left Costel Pantilimon surprisingly underemployed in goal.\n\nDisplaying poor first touch and failing to hold the ball up, Lukaku should shoulder much of the blame in a game in which he was shown up by the industry and incision of Sunderland’s lone striker, Steven Fletcher.\n\nAs the bright November sunshine slowly faded Lukaku finally roused himself sufficiently to test Sunderland’s goalkeeper. When Liam Bridcutt conceded possession, opportunity beckoned but a combination of the striker over-running the ball and Pantilimon’s diving save spared Bridcutt’s blushes.\n\nAfter Lukaku’s next shot struck the outside of a post, Poyet’s mind turned to substitutions. Off came the once again underwhelming Johnson – a talent Sunderland’s manager acknowledges is a shadow of the player he really should be – to be replaced by Will Buckley. The former Brighton winger made an instant impact, his bold sashay forward being rudely abridged by Baines’ foul just outside the box.\n\nLarsson capped a good game by reminding everyone of his dead-ball expertise courtesy of an immaculate free-kick delivery curved, with his right foot, into the bottom corner.\n\nThe Wearside celebrations proved short-lived. When Eto’o slipped a neat pass to Coleman, Wickham, serving as the last defender and denying a clear goal-scoring opportunity, rashly sent the Everton right-back crashing to earth.\n\nIt looked a clear penalty and Lee Mason – who should arguably have sent off Wickham – was certainly not buying into Sunderland’s somewhat excessive protestations. Following a short delay Baines took the kick. It was far from the left-back’s finest penalty but nonetheless Pantilimon could not prevent the ball passing under his body en route to the back of the net. “It should have been a red card,” Martínez said. “It was a major moment.”\n\nSo, too, was the slightly surreal cameo which saw Howard control the ball outside his area with his stomach after dropping on it in a cat-like pounce. Although he did not use his arms, few goalkeeping manoeuvres are as high risk and Sunderland fans duly screamed “handball”.\n\n“It was tough for the referee today; I wouldn’t have liked to be him,” said Poyet, who liberated Jack Rodwell, once of Everton, from the bench, in place of Gómez.\n\nYet still a decisive goal stubbornly refused to materialise and all that remained was for the managers, former Real Zaragoza team-mates, to share the warmest of embraces.\n\n“It was one of those games that was always in the balance,”Martínez. “We controlled it with ease for long spells but we didn’t use that control to create clear cut opportunities.”\n\nMan of the match Sebastian Larsson (Sunderland)"}, {"date": "09/11/2014", "arena": "White Hart Lane", "attendance": 35699, "home_team": {"name":

The extent to which this Spurs team bears no resemblance to the style of football Pochettino encouraged at Southampton is striking. From high-intensity pressing on the south coast to a kind of anti-pressing in north London. (Or perhaps from a Spurs perspective, just plain depressing).\n\nMark Hughes’s team were able to withstand two changes to their backline but remain largely comfortable and they eased into a two-goal lead they did not relinquish. Opportunism, organisation and a firm dose of Premier League knowhow was enough to squash the shoots of optimism that Tottenham developed with a little run that included two cup wins.\n\nPochettino underlined how much work is needed to establish more positive form. “We are very disappointed and frustrated for the result and performance. We need to improve a lot,” he said. “We need to improve quickly. You never have a lot of time in football. We need to find a solution and change mentality in the next few weeks. That is my challenge.”\n\nThe long-awaited Premier League start for Harry Kane, and the sprinkling of stardust with one of his heroes, Jürgen Klinsmann, in attendance, created a wave of excitement that quickly crashed. Three minutes in, the 21-year-old was in the clear in front of goal but could not quite find the angle with his header, and moments later Stoke were ahead.\n\nSpurs conceded possession carelessly. Stoke worked the ball neatly to Bojan Krkic, who found little in the way of resistance as he cantered goalwards. There were plenty of white shirts around him but most took the form of bystanders as Krkic advanced, and the former Barcelona forward tried his luck. His shot ricocheted past Hugo Lloris.\n\nSpiking what they perceived to be a vulnerable atmosphere was all part of the plan for the visitors. “Maybe there is a bit of pressure on their players and we thought if we started positively we could use that to our own ends,” Hughes said.\n\nPochettino was dismayed by the consequences of losing such an early goal. “We started to be uncomfortable when in possession of the ball, make rash decisions. It’s not possible to make these mistakes in the Premier League,” he lamented.\n\nThe atmosphere began to get very tetchy, with the home support irritated at Asmir Begovic’s attempts to slow down the game – the keeper was booked midway through the first half. Of more serious concern was the overall disconnect inherent in the Tottenham performance. They struggled to show cohesion or personality.\n\nStoke did not really need to run down the clock when there were goals to be had. Having had the share of early chances, they gleefully took up another invitation offered by the chaotic Tottenham defence. Mame Diouf scampered up the right flank and the home backline tore itself apart to give Jonathan Walters the freedom of the box. He steered in Diouf’s cross under all the pressure of a park kickabout.\n\nStoke merited their advantage. The way Krkic drifted deep to cause damage and worked so hard while he was at it was impressive. Walters and Victor Moses timed their runs from wide positions with thoughtful discipline. Behind them Steven Nzonzi dominated midfield.\n\nHughes was delighted with the contribution of his counterattacking players, but equally pleased with the way his team reorganised defensively considering they lost half their backline in the first half to injury. Phil Bardsley pulled his groin and then Marc Wilson pulled a hamstring with over an hour to go. Stoke remained strong. “From start to finish we had a gameplan and understood what was required,” Hughes said.\n\nPochettino made a double substitution at half-time to try to shake up things. On came Érik Lamela and Mousa Dembélé. With a quarter of an hour to go, Tottenham crafted their first genuine threat of the second half. Lamela’s free-kick was sweetly struck but Begovic responded to palm away superbly. With so much pent-up frustration, the White Hart Lane crowd erupted when Nacer Chadli rifled in a volley from an improbable near-post angle.\n\nAttempts at a full recovery were hindered when Kyle Naughton clipped Moses as he burst clear on the break and was sent off. Steven Ireland was denied the chance to rebuild a two-goal margin when Lloris tipped away.\n\nEmmanuel Adebayor glanced a stoppage-time header wide and that was that. The music blasted at a staggering volume come the final whistle to drown out any audible home disappointment. Still, Stoke’s celebrations for a first away win since August could be heard over the din.\n\nMan of the match Bojan Krkic (Stoke)"}, {"date": "09/11/2014", "arena": "The Hawthorns", "attendance": 26476, "home_team": {"name": "West Bromwich Albion", "lineup": [{"name": "Ben Foster", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andre Wisdom", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Craig Dawson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joleon Lescott", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sébastien Pocognoli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Graham Dorrans", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [76]}, {"name": "Youssouf Mulumbu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [63]}, {"name": "James Morrison", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Brunt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Anichebe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Saido Berahino", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Chris Baird", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Claudio Yacob", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Boaz Myhill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cristian Gamboa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gareth McAuley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stéphane Sessegnon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [63], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Georgios Samaras", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [76], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Newcastle United", "lineup": [{"name": "Tim Krul", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daryl Janmaat", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fabricio Coloccini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [62], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [78]}, {"name": "Paul Dummett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Massadio Haidara", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mehdi Abeid", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Colback", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rémy Cabella", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [82]}, {"name": "Moussa Sissoko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sammy Ameobi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [78]}, {"name": "Ayoze Pérez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [45], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Ryan Taylor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [82], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mike Williamson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [78], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Vurnon Anita", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Papiss Cisse", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yoan Gouffran", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [78], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rob Elliot", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Armstrong", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Crisis? What crisis? It is 41 days since Alan Pardew went to Stoke City, after Mike Ashley had reportedly told a punter outside a pub that his manager would be out of work if Newcastle United lost, and suffered yet another defeat to hit rock bottom. Yet after this fifth successive victory, including a Capital One Cup triumph at Manchester City, Pardew’s team lie two points off the top four. Perhaps Ashley is an enlightened chairman rather than a loose-mouthed fan with more money than sense. How refreshing it is to see a manager survive and prevail.\n\nAyoze Pérez, signed from Tenerife for £1.6m in the summer, scored for the third league game in a row as Pardew’s resurrection continued apace. Newcastle won six consecutive games around Easter 2012 but seldom in the Premier League has a manager so dramatically overseen such a turnaround in fortunes. Ashley can claim huge credit for standing by his man.\n\nPardew turned and gave a thumbs-up to his employer even before the final whistle which, while not quite in the realms of José Mourinho seeking a handshake from the opposing dugout, reflected the confidence and relief sweeping through this proud and passionate club.\n\n“You can imagine everyone was pulling at him, and he stuck with me, and was very supportive, especially after the Southampton game [0-4 in September],” Pardew said. “And you’ve got to have that as a manager, have that faith in you, in the work you’re doing on the training ground, from the chief executive and from the staff.\n\n“I like to think that buys you enough time. It maybe bought me just enough time on this occasion. It was just nice to say at that point, with a couple of minutes to go with the game won, ‘Good win’.”\n\nThe Newcastle fans who went to such extremes baying for their manager’s head during that run of one win in 15 league games are not quite singing his name just yet but on Sunday they were vociferous in their enjoyment of this thoroughly deserved win.\n\n“Newcastle fans are an extreme of any fan,” Pardew acknowledged. “They’re emotional: when they win, they go mad; when they lose, they go mad as well. We weren’t winning games, and that’s what I’m paid to do. I tried to be consistent through that period; now we’re on this lovely little run, I’ll try to be consistent as well through this. I hope they respect that. We won’t get carried away, and we’ve got a lot to learn with these young players. But so far, so good.”\n\nWest Bromwich Albion have mustered their own rally this season but, after gaining five points from their previous three games, this was a day to forget.\n\nSaido Berahino will go off on England duty on Monday somewhat chastened after his prolific run of five goals in as many games was interrupted. “He probably had his poorest game but people have poor games,” Alan Irvine, the West Brom manager, said.\n\n“Everybody will ask, including myself, whether it’s a question of what happened in the week [his first senior England call-up] but you can have a poor game at any time.”\n\nWhile Berahino could not locate top gear, bar one rising drive early on that Tim Krul tipped over on his way to extending the club’s run without conceding to 342 minutes in all competitions, Newcastle’s front man continued his rich vein of form. With Papiss Cissé still not fully fit after knee surgery, Pérez has been instrumental in aiding Newcastle’s astonishing reversal in fortunes.\n\nSammy Ameobi had cut back inside to hit a beautiful swerved shot against Ben Foster’s crossbar early in a first half that was as notable for the several separate minutes of respectful applause for worthy remembrances as it was for penetrative football.\n\nNewcastle were playing with the combination of freedom and structure that comes from a resilient response to adversity when they took the lead in the last minute of the first half.\n\nThe ball was played via a succession of short passes all the way across from Ameobi on the left to Daryl Janmaat raiding in from the right and from the Dutchman’s prompt low centre, Pérez produced the deftest of touches to clip the ball with the heel of his right foot from behind his left foot to accelerate the ball on and past Foster.\n\nThe timing of the goal could not have been better for Newcastle and they returned for the second half with a spring in their step and with the Geordie faithful in fine voice in the Smethwick End.\n\nFabricio Coloccini was still up from an earlier corner when the ball was worked back out to Janmaat who bamboozled Youssouf Mulumbu, deputising for the suspended Craig Gardner, before delivering a lofted cross for the Newcastle captain to thud in his first Premier League goal since January 2011.\n\nMan of the match Ayoze Pérez (Newcastle)"}, {"date": "09/11/2014", "arena": "The Liberty Stadium", "attendance": 20812, "home_team": {"name": "Swansea

Five days after seeing his side surrender a three-goal lead in the Champions League against Anderlecht, the Arsenal manager was forced to endure the painful sight of Swansea City scoring twice in three minutes to turn this game around and inflict a defeat that will prompt a fresh bout of soul-searching.\n\nLeading through a fine breakaway goal from Alexis Sánchez, who has scored 12 in his last 14 appearances, Arsenal were on course for a much-needed victory until 15 minutes from time. They never looked comfortable and it was no real surprise – especially on the back of imploding against Anderlecht – Wenger’s players were unable to see the game out.\n\nSwansea, for whom Jefferson Montero was outstanding, levelled when Gylfi Sigurdsson curled a sublime 25-yard free-kick into the top corner, after Kieran Gibbs had cynically brought down Modou Barrow, the Swansea substitute. Re-energised by Sigurdsson’s goal, Swansea sensed blood. Garry Monk, the Swansea manager, immediately made another change when he replaced Wilfried Bony with Bafétimbi Gomis and once again the substitution paid dividends.\n\nMontero, who tormented Calum Chambers throughout, went past the Arsenal right-back with alarming ease before standing up a deep cross that Gomis, towering above Nacho Monreal, headed powerfully across goal and into the far corner. It was the Frenchman’s first Premier League goal since arriving on a free transfer in the summer. He had been on the pitch only two minutes.\n\nWenger responded by throwing on the cavalry in the shape of Theo Walcott and Jack Wilshere but the damage was done. Arsenal, from leading 3-0 against Anderlecht with 29 minutes to go, and 1-0 against Swansea with 15 minutes remaining, have one point to show for their efforts. Wenger described it as “a very disappointing week”. Some Arsenal supporters may not be so polite with their assessment.\n\nArsenal could have few complaints about the outcome. Although Swansea’s goals came late, there was nothing convincing about Arsenal’s performance. They looked flat – perhaps a legacy of Tuesday night’s travails against Anderlecht – never got hold of the game in the middle of the pitch, where Wenger bemoaned the number of challenges that were lost, and threatened only sporadically going forward. Even Sánchez, whose goals seem to be carrying Arsenal at the moment, fell short of his usual standards. “Not one of his best games,” Wenger said.\n\nIt is Arsenal’s defence who continue to come under the greatest scrutiny. With Laurent Koscielny and Mathieu Debuchy injured and without cover, Arsenal have been left terribly exposed. Monreal looks uncomfortable at centre-half and was found wanting for the second goal while Chambers endured a chastening match. “We were a bit struggling on the right side, but I have no experienced players on the bench,” Wenger said.\n\nWhile the Arsenal inquest could go on and on, Swansea deserve immense credit for the way they exploited their opponents’ weaknesses. Despite their preparations being severely hampered by late injuries to Federico Fernández, Wayne Routledge and Nathan Dyer, Swansea played with courage and conviction, no more so than when they fell behind . “We’ve got that inner belief and that’s what carried us through,” Monk said.\n\nThere was no doubting the star of the show. Montero, who played for Ecuador in the World Cup finals and joined Swansea in the summer from the Mexican club Monarcas Morelia, was a constant threat with his pacy runs on the left flank. “He had everything today,” Monk said.\n\n“He’s been working very hard on his game defensively but we all know what he can do offensively. He was probably the most consistent player on the pitch.”\n\nThe game itself had been something of a slowburner, with the first real incident of note when Phil Dowd, the referee, waved away Swansea appeals for a penalty in the 21st minute, after Chambers appeared to push Bony. Marvin Emnes wasted a decent chance for Swansea, after Chambers had slipped over on the opposite side of the field, while at the other end Danny Welbeck was denied at the near post and Aaron Ramsey flashed a volley inches wide.\n\nArsenal’s goal came from a classic counterattack. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain seized possession inside the Swansea half and moved the ball on to Santi Cazorla, who released Welbeck on the Arsenal right. Welbeck ran clear before checking inside Ashley Williams and rolling the ball square for Sánchez to sweep home. There was a time when Arsenal prided themselves on winning games 1-0 but those days are long gone.\n\nSwansea should have levelled when Montero got to the byline for the umpteenth time and cut the ball back invitingly for Bony but he sliced his side-foot shot horribly wide. It was a reprieve for Arsenal but they were punished moments later when Sigurdsson struck a wonderfully placed free-kick beyond Wojciech Szczesny.\n\nWith Arsenal still reeling from that setback, Neil Taylor fed Montero and the winger left Chambers in his wake before crossing for Gomis to head home.\n\nMan of the match Jefferson Montero (Swansea City)"}, {"date": "08/11/2014", "arena": "Anfield",

There was no strategic time-wasting and none of the ultra-defensive tactics that led to Brendan Rodgers accusing him of “parking two buses” in front of goal when the sides met last season. Liverpool, to put it bluntly, do not inspire that kind of trepidation any more and Chelsea could dismantle them without any complaints about their methods.\n\nThey did it with the look of champions-in-waiting whereas it was difficult at times to remember that Rodgers had actually rested seven of these players when Liverpool lost to Real Madrid in midweek. Mario Balotelli’s half-hearted efforts are becoming the norm at Anfield but it was rare to see Steven Gerrard play with such diminished qualities. Chelsea’s fans relentlessly reminded Gerrard of his infamous mistake from this fixture last season and there was another dose of schadenfreude in the form of a horse by the name of Gerrard’s Slip running in the 12.40 at Doncaster. Nothing, however, could have hurt the Liverpool captain more than his own performance and the way his team were overwhelmed.\n\nIt left Liverpool 15 points off their opponents at the top of the league and, for the first time, there was open dissent from the crowd towards Rodgers, angrily objecting to his decision to take off Philippe Coutinho and Emre Can for Fabio Borini and Joe Allen shortly after Diego Costa had scored Chelsea’s second goal. Can had opened the scoring with a deflected shot in the ninth minute but he and Coutinho, in fairness to Rodgers, had faded badly. The bigger mystery was how Balotelli lasted so long. When he was substituted later on, the away end serenaded him with “Fernando Torres, he’s better than you” – and it’s not as if Chelsea’s fans ever properly rated Torres.\n\nChelsea did have to withstand some late pressure and Liverpool have legitimate grievances about that moment, after 87 minutes, when Gary Cahill blocked a Gerrard shot with his hand. The referee, Anthony Taylor, was guilty of missing a clear penalty but Rodgers was stretching the truth when he tried to argue a draw would have been an accurate assessment of how the contest went. The truth is that Chelsea were the more rounded side for at least three-quarters of the game. They played with control and know-how, with Nemanja Matic outstanding in midfield and Cesc Fàbregas only marginally subdued by Jordan Henderson’s man-marking. Fàbregas, Mourinho revealed afterwards, had played despite a hamstring injury and may now miss a couple of matches. The same applies to Ramires, with a groin problem. “They were really in trouble but they put themselves there for the team,” Mourinho said. It typified the spirit of his side.\n\nChelsea had to show all their competitive courage, too, bearing in mind the way the game started, with Can’s 25-yard shot taking a deflection off Cahill to wrong-foot Thibaut Courtois for the early breakthrough. Unfortunately for Liverpool, their vulnerability from set pieces will always encourage opponents and once again it was a significant factor in everything unravelling. The equaliser came five minutes later from a corner, swung over by Fàbregas and initially headed on by Costa. John Terry had the first attempt at goal and Simon Mignolet’s reflex save fell to Cahill via a slight touch off Matic. This time the goalline technology showed Cahill’s shot had squeezed past Liverpool’s goalkeeper. What an indictment for the home side that, in a matter of seconds, four Chelsea players had touched the ball in the six-yard area without a defender getting near.\n\nFor the rest of the first half it was startling to see so many unforced errors from Liverpool’s players and so much panic in the face of Chelsea pressure. Chelsea out-passed and outplayed them and, even though there were no more goals, it was rare to see a Liverpool side look so hassled on their own pitch. Gerrard could be seen misplacing passes, kicking the ball against Henderson at one point, but it was his lack of mobility that was shocking and the frequency with which opponents turned past him.\n\nBalotelli was ineffectual and frustratingly lazy whereas Rodgers surely made a mistake selecting Dejan Lovren when Kolo Touré had excelled in the Bernabéu. Lovren did little to alter the view his £20m acquisition has been dismal business on Liverpool’s part. He was signed to bring some leadership to the Liverpool defence but there was absolutely none and his day could probably be summed up by the moment Oscar treated him to a nutmeg. Eden Hazard later did the same on Henderson.\n\nHazard had the beating of Glen Johnson while Branislav Ivanovic, a right-back, apparently, had long spells operating as an extra forward and Costa, this battering-ram of a striker, did everything he could to unsettle Liverpool’s defence. Costa gives the impression sometimes that he cannot see a belt without punching below it. He seemed determined to embroil Martin Skrtel in a running feud and, by half-time, they were having to be held apart.\n\nMore importantly, the Spain international is a lethal finisher. Midway through the second half, César Azpilicueta ran down the left, kept the ball in play and turned brilliantly inside Coutinho. Mignolet turned his effort away but the loose ball flicked off Alberto Moreno into Costa’s path. His finish was drilled in and when the game finished in a moment of tragicomedy – Mignolet kicking a simple backpass behind his goal – Liverpool were left to reflect how far they fallen since the last occasion Chelsea were in town."}, {"date": "08/11/2014", "arena": "Turf Moor", "attendance": 16998, "home_team": {"name": "Burnley", "lineup": [{"name": "Tom Heaton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kieran Trippier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Duff", "yellows": [56], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jason Shackell", "yellows": [28], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stephen Ward", "yellows": [42], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Scott Arfield", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [55]}, {"name": "Dean Marney", "yellows": [86], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Jones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "George Boyd", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Barnes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [50], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [75]}, {"name": "Danny Ings", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Ben Mee", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Kightly", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [55], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marvin Sordell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lukas Jutkiewicz", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [75], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathaniel Chalobah", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matthew Gilks", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Keane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Hull City", "lineup": [{"name": "Steve Harper", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Chester", "yellows": [7], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [59]}, {"name": "Paul McShane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Curtis Davies", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ahmed Elmohamady", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Huddlestone", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [51]}, {"name": "Jake Livermore", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robbie Brady", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mohamed Diamé", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Abel Hernandez", "yellows": [72], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sone Aluko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [51]}], "subs": [{"name": "Liam Rosenior", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Meyler", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eldin Jakupovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gaston Ramirez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [51], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andrew Robertson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stephen Quinn", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [51], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Hatem Ben Arfa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [59], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Finally. Finally Burnley have won a game. One hundred and ninety-six days since they last tasted victory, 11 games into a Premier League campaign when they had only led a match for three minutes, long after most outside Turf Moor came to the conclusion they were doomed, Sean Dyche’s team became the last of the 256 teams in the top 11 divisions to triumph.\n\nIt was richly deserved. Few teams have worked harder for a win. Burnley reaped the reward for their incessant efforts. Hull were overrun before they were overcome. Indeed, to compound their other failings, they were also out-jumped when Kieran Trippier swung in a right-wing cross and Ashley Barnes soared above Ahmed Elmohamady to head in.\n\nHe made a fitting match-winner. Barnes was the sole signing to cost Burnley a fee during Dyche’s first 18 months in charge. He scored against Wigan when the Clarets clinched promotion and this was his first goal since that heady April day that ended with the players giving Dyche the bumps. After their subsequent slump, they could finally celebrate again. “A marker is laid down, you get your first win and everyone feels better,” said Dyche.\n\nHis own input was crucial. Barnes was not even on the bench at Arsenal last week. Bringing him in for Marvin Sordell may have seemed the footballing equivalent of rearranging the deckchairs on the Titanic but Dyche has shuffled his strikers in the search for a winning combination. He found one in Barnes and Danny Ings.\n\nThe latter brought perky endeavour and a persistence that almost yielded a goal. A first-minute lob dropped narrowly wide while an audacious 60-yard shot bounced past the post with Steve Harper stranded out of his penalty area. If the goalkeeper was at fault then, he had come to Hull’s rescue with a magnificent block from Ings’ volley. “An unbelievable save,” said Dyche. What followed was more farcical: Paul McShane’s attempted clearance was a wild slice that Robbie Brady had to hook off the goalline.\n\nIt rather summed up Hull’s propensity to cause themselves problems. “We have gifted Burnley the first win,” said the manager, Steve Bruce. “We knew we didn’t want to be the first one. It is very rare in two-and-a-half years I have been at the club that I can be embarrassed and say sorry to supporters. It was a pale shadow of the team we were two weeks ago.”\n\nThen Hull were praised for holding first Arsenal and then Liverpool. Now Bruce’s frustrations were apparent when he made three substitutions before the hour mark. Curtis Davies then limped off and his manager added: “We were better with 10 men than with 11. That is a sad indictment of the first hour. We were nowhere near the level. That has eroded all we have done.”\n\nBurnley’s hope is that this will prove a stepping stone. “More than one win is needed,” said Dyche. While others wondered if his side would complete the campaign without winning a game, he was always a paragon of positivity. His aim is winning a relegation battle, not just a match.\n\n“It is important psychologically for the players,” he said. “It gives belief to the players and the town that we can at least we least compete to make the impossible, as everyone is telling me it is, possible.”"}, {"date": "08/11/2014", "arena": "Old Trafford", "attendance": 75325, "home_team": {"name": "Manchester United", "lineup":

Louis van Gaal’s men are just not dominating in a manner expected for the £150m-plus summer outlay.\n\nWhile the mood is better this current United is hardly an upgrade on last season’s David Moyes vintage. They hoarded possession here so the result was correct – the match-winner, Juan Mata, came close to a second when hitting a Crystal Palace post late on – yet with the visit to Arsenal coming up after the international break there is more pondering to be done.\n\nVan Gaal said: “We had patience but we need more speed and more switches [in play].” This sluggishness is a feature this term. How can this be changed? “That’s difficult against a defending team but you can give the pass with more speed. Then you can switch the play,” said the manager. “You make them move and run after that ball and at the end, every team is tired. Then one or two or three players forget the shape and that’s what I mean.”\n\nThe big positive is that a win is a win, of course, and United are up to sixth in the chase for a Champions League place. As Van Gaal said: “We are now two points behind fourth place, so it’s in our hands. I am happy. After the goal, we killed the game for the first time. We did it well and deserved to win. I am happy with the three points and we stay in the race to end in the places that we want to be in. That’s important.”\n\nA United XI showing two changes from last Sunday’s derby defeat began brightly as Ángel Di María smashed a free-kick against the Palace wall. Marcos Rojo’s dislocated shoulder and Chris Smalling’s suspension meant yet another shuffling of Van Gaal’s defensive pack. This time he moved Daley Blind to centre-back and recalled Paddy McNair to maintain his preference for a left-right foot combination.\n\nThis was his 11th different combination at centre-back, a telling illustration of the problems that have plagued Van Gaal, and near the half’s end were two scares. Yannick Bolasie sprinted along United’s right and curved over a ball that hit Luke Shaw with Fraizer Campbell closing in.\n\nThe other moment of danger occurred moments beforehand. Palace launched a long ball at McNair who, wrongly, allowed this to bounce – he may have thought the nearby Blind would clear – and Campbell had a clear chance in front of David De Gea. But the No10’s attempted lob was too high.\n\nVan Gaal said: “We didn’t have to defend much but you’re always only one moment away and that came in first half with the lob over De Gea. It’s always difficult to beat teams who are only defending.”\n\nTo this accusation Warnock said: “I think that’s the best opportunity I’ve had to beat Man United. The chance we missed was the best opportunity of the game with Fraizer Campbell. If we could have got in front then the crowd would have grown restless.”\n\nShaw has endured a stuttering start at United since joining in the summer but he provide the period’s finest moment. He picked up possession in a deep position and surged straight downfield scattering a backpedalling and panicky Palace before him and, when the shot came, only a fine Julian Speroni save denied Shaw a classic Roy of the Rovers goal.\n\nAfter the break a Di María free-kick from the left found Robin van Persie who played in Marouane Fellaini. Again the ball would not quite fall right and the Belgian’s snapshot was blocked. Next up to try and break the deadlock was Wayne Rooney. McNair rushed forward with the ball and squeezed a pass to him. But as in the first half when trying to direct the finish, Rooney’s radar proved off.\n\nAdrian Mariappa now posed a question from Palace when scooping a cross into the area that needed David De Gea’s long reach to pluck from the air but as the hour passed the contest remained scoreless though United were unlucky when a Fellaini header was cleared from the Palace line by James McArthur.\n\nNow, Van Gaal made his move as off came Adnan Januzaj for Mata. Moments later, slick interplay between the Spaniard and Fellaini and Di Maria and Mata beat Speroni.\n\n“He didn’t change our formation or style but he scores goals – and because of that, we won,” said the manager.\n\nMata, who has been dislodged from a starting place, was understandably pleased. “It was probably one of our most important wins. We needed three points. I got a goal and am very happy today. When you come on, you try to change the game. It was always on my mind – luckily I did it.\n\n“Now it’s time to rest.

Ronald Koeman’s team struggled to overcome doughty Leicester City until Shane Long came off the bench to extend their fine start to the campaign and end his own wait for a league goal.\n\nThe Irishman came into the game hoping to fend off mutterings about him being the one ill-advised purchase during Southampton’s successful summer revamp and, after being introduced in the second half, he began justifying his £12m transfer from Hull with two nifty finishes that banished the disgruntlement that was beginning to infect St Mary’s.\n\nThe match began amid relentless rain and ended with gloomy forecasts for Leicester, who have now collected a solitary point from their past six matches and failed to even score in the past four. “We need to be more ruthless in both boxes, but I have got great belief in these players,” said Nigel Pearson, whose team displayed plenty of tenacity as they kept Southampton at bay for long periods.\n\nThe home side hogged possession but the only fright for Leicester’s goalkeeper, Kasper Schmeichel, in the first 20 minutes was when Ryan Bertrand pinged a dangerous cross to Dusan Tadic. The header that followed suggested that aerial power is not one of the winger’s many attributes.\n\nIn the 21st minute Nathaniel Clyne troubled Schmeichel for the first time, his 20-yard rasper forcing a save from the Dane. Leicester took that as a cue to assert their own ability going forward, and they won a couple of corners in quick succession, Wes Morgan going close with a header from one. But the visitors could not build on that and spent most of the rest of the match in their own half.\n\n“We were the dominant team but we did not create a lot of opportunities,” said Koeman.\n\n“We spoke about that at half-time and said that if we keep good organisation and had a clean sheet, we will score because we have players who will make the difference.”\n\nLong arrived in the 68th minute in place of Sadio Mané, perhaps the Southampton player most guilty of undoing promising work by delivering wayward final passes.\n\nThe breakthrough soon followed. Jack Cork hoisted a cross into the box and Graziano Pellè took it down and teed up Long, who curled a lovely finish into the far corner to an explosion of relief around the ground. It must have soothed him, too, after failing to find the net in his previous nine league games for the Saints, with his only goal coming in the Capital One Cup.\n\n“Shane is doing very well,” said Koeman, who never lost faith in his recruit. “He had some adaptation problems in the beginning, the way we play and train is much different to what he had in the past. You have to keep talking with the player so that he keeps confidence. He made the difference in the last part of this game.”\n\nLong demonstrated his confidence five minutes after his first goal, when a deep pass from Victor Wanyama found Leicester caught short at the back for once. Long fired expertly past Schmeichel. Cue the “We’re going to win the league” chants that are becoming a regular, if slightly tongue-in-cheek, feature of Southampton home games.\n\nNot that Koeman is saying Southampton are destined to fall down the table. “Maybe the big teams have more quality players than we have but I don’t see a big difference between how they play and us,” he said.\n\n“[Esteban] Cambiasso said to me at the end: ‘What a good team you have,’ and that’s a big compliment from a great player.”"}, {"date": "08/11/2014", "arena": "Upton Park", "attendance": 34857, "home_team": {"name": "West Ham United", "lineup":

"report": "Seasoned West Ham United supporters had seen this coming. The club were riding the crest of a wave, playing slick, winning football and inspiring talk of Europe. Before the kick-off, there had been the announcement of manager and player of the month awards for Sam Allardyce and Diafra Sakho respectively while Aston Villa were on their worst run of form since the 1960s. So the subsequent stalemate was inevitable.\n\nThere was nearly a fairytale twist. Brought on as an injury-time substitute for his first game of the season, after ankle ligament damage, Andy Carroll’s first touch was to meet Stewart Downing’s cross with a thumping header that drew a stunning, reaction save from Brad Guzan. Paul Lambert, the Aston Villa manager, called the goalkeeper’s intervention world class.\n\nWest Ham came on strong towards the end, with Sakho blowing two headed opportunities and Carl Jenkinson another. Allardyce felt that Jenkinson’s chance in the 89th minute from another Downing cross – he could not generate any power from six yards out – was the clearest opportunity. There was even time for Carroll to work Guzan again from yet another header.\n\nAllardyce said his switch from a diamond midfield formation to 4-2-3-1, which meant Downing moved from the middle to the left flank, was the prompt for West Ham to threaten the breakthrough. Yet the late flurry apart, it was pretty forgettable fare. With Arsenal not playing until Sunday at Swansea, West Ham edged into fourth place but the over-riding emotion for them was frustration.\n\n“Villa are a frustrating team to break down but we did break them down several times,” Allardyce said. “We just couldn’t break down the goalkeeper. I was disappointed with our finishing.”\n\nThe happiness belonged to Lambert, who talked of a “great” and “deserved” point, which lifted a small portion of the gloom that had built after six consecutive Premier League defeats. Without the suspended Christian Benteke, Villa threatened only sporadically, but Lambert could salute the resilience of the performance with some justification. Ron Vlaar and Nathan Baker put their bodies on the line in central defence – Baker was injured in the 86th minute and was taken off on a stretcher – and then there was Guzan, who refused to be beaten.\n\nThe pattern was established early on; West Ham pressing on to the front foot and Villa looking to remain compact and plunder something on the counter. Their lack of goals has been a serious problem – they have five for the season – and they created little of clear-cut note, apart from a couple of first-half flurries.\n\nGabriel Agbonlahor, who played up front in Benteke’s absence, skated past James Collins after a loose pass by Mark Noble but he shot wildly while Andreas Weimann jinked and belted straight at Adrián after a burst from Charles N’Zogbia.\n\nDowning, a former Villa midfielder had West Ham’s best moments in the first-half. His fierce shot on 22 minutes after good work by Sakho stung Guzan’s palms while he sliced another effort wide when well-placed. Collins thudded a header at Guzan from Downing’s corner and Noble had a shot blocked by Vlaar. Guzan also came for, and missed, a high ball and he was fortunate that Sakho’s header was off-target."}, {"date": "08/11/2014", "arena": "Kiyan Prince Foundation Stadium", "attendance": 18005,

straining to repel the barrage of passes pumped into their box, Manchester City could cry frustration at taking a mere point from this thrilling occasion. Yet that was a deception. Those frantic final forays summed up how chaotic the champions feel at present. Their title defence is starting to feel unlikely.\n\nA team this talented, crammed with as much pedigree as City possess, should be imposing themselves far more authoritatively on games such as this: a contest against a team scrapping in the relegation zone, but whose industry and even organisation ensured this was never a mismatch. QPR will not remain beneath the cut-off for long on this evidence. It was Sergio Agüero’s brilliance that denied them victory, with the Argentinian fast becoming City’s equivalent to Luis Suárez at Liverpool last year. His brace swelled his tally to nine goals in six matches, his threat omnipresent and irrepressible. “He’s the best player in the Premier League now Suárez has gone,” said Harry Redknapp. “The best.”\n\nYet City are over-reliant on his form and fitness and the striker desperately needs those around him to reimpose their own qualities on the division. Touré had his moments, and Jesús Navas offered flashes of quality down the flank, but too much of the visitors’ approach was shapeless, lacking composure in the face of QPR’s bite and energy. Fernandinho was by-passed, Edin Dzeko lasted four minutes as a substitute, Fernando offered little besides one fine interception to deny Bobby Zamora a tap-in, while the defence is panic-ridden and prone without Vincent Kompany. The Belgian was watching on from the stands, nursing a sore calf. At no stage did City feel secure without him, and an eight-point deficit from Chelsea – not forgetting four points from Southampton – feels a daunting gap already.\n\nQPR exploited all the vulnerability exposed by CSKA Moscow in Europe in midweek, or even by a depleted Manchester United in the culmination of last weekend’s derby even if that was a game City actually won. From the moment Eduardo Vargas and Mauricio Isla sized up their opportunities down the right against a nervy back line, the hosts made inroads against jittery opponents.\n\nCharlie Austin, watched by Roy Hodgson, might have had a first-half hat-trick only for Joe Hart to summon two fine saves and two other efforts to be ruled out, correctly, by the officials. Where the first had been a clear offside, the second non-award was courtesy of a minutia of the laws of the game.\n\nHart had appeared in two minds as he took the free-kick for the offside inside the penalty area, the goalkeeper still considering a pass to Gaël Clichy, and his left foot touched the ball forward before his right swung through to send it squirting straight at Austin 20 yards out. The striker’s finish was belted inside the goalkeeper’s near post only for Mike Dean, alerted by his assistant, to rule it out as the goalkeeper’s first touch had not taken the ball directly out of the penalty area. A quirk of Law 13, that the ball is not considered to be in play until it leaves the penalty area, had come to the visitors’ rescue. Yet, even then, they were pierced before they could recover some poise as Austin, played marginally onside by Eliaquim Mangala, collected Isla’s pass and rasped his sixth league goal of the term, across Hart and in.\n\nThe London side were just as impressive after the interval as an attacking force, rewarded for their effervescence when Barton and Vargas sent Austin down the right, with the forward’s cross inadvertently nodded into his own net by Martín Demichelis, panicked and unsighted by the diving Bobby Zamora in front of him. Yet either side of those home rewards had come the reminders of Agüero’s brilliance, as if the forward was carrying this side alone.\n\nThe first might have been ruled out for offside or, more obviously given the speed of the striker’s dart, a handball as he flicked the loose ball on to his right arm in scurrying away from Richard Dunne and towards Steven Caulker. The touch fell perfectly for him to dispatch with his left foot, with Rob Green’s protests waved away. His second equaliser was a study in strength and skill, collecting Touré’s punt, taking two touches around Green and then calmly checking back, all low centre of gravity, to convert as defenders massed on the line.\n\n“He is a very important player for us, one of the top players in the world,” said Manuel Pellegrini. “But he needs the whole performance of the team to grow again to how we normally play.”\n\nPellegrini went on to speak of his side enduring an “unlucky moment”, which is vaguely reminiscent of Carlo Ancelotti’s “bad moment” while losing his grip at Chelsea three years ago. The City manager’s criticisms of the defence did not extend beyond conceding it had “not been our best performance”.\n\nIf his players do not tighten up and inject a sense of solidity and structure after the international break then all thoughts of retaining their Premier League title will dwindle. A solitary win in six matches in all competitions is a grim statistic. Even with that frantic finale, they did not merit a second success here."}, {"date": "03/11/2014", "arena": "Selhurst Park", "attendance": 23212, "home_team": {"name": "Crystal Palace", "lineup":

great escape.\n\nHaving seen his Sunderland team battered from pillar to post in recent weeks, another calamitous error from Wes Brown had gifted Crystal Palace a way back into this relegation six-pointer after Steven Fletcher’s opener.\n\nThere looked like only one winner at that stage as Palace, spurred on by a vociferous home support and a rejuvenated Wilfried Zaha, came forward at will. Yet in an instant, Poyet’s luck appeared to turn at a ground where the former Brighton manager was never going to be afforded the best of receptions. A powerful run across the penalty area from Will Buckley – one of the Uruguayan’s star players during his time on the south coast – set up Jordi Gómez for a first-time strike that flew into the Palace net.\n\nTo compound the home side’s misery, the captain Mile Jedinak was dismissed after being shown a second yellow card in the dying minutes before Fletcher’s second of the night rounded things off.\n\n“It means more than anyone can think,” Poyet said. “It’s been a difficult couple of weeks. We had to get back to doing the basic things well and we needed a little bit [of luck] as well. The only way to get rid of the atmosphere that has been affecting us was to win a match and thankfully we have done that now.”\n\nAfter conceding 10 goals in their previous two matches, Poyet’s reaction had been to drop the goalkeeper Vito Mannone and Brown – both guilty of horrendous mistakes in the 2-0 defeat to Arsenal. But the spectre of the 8-0 mauling by Southampton in their last away game still appeared to be haunting Santiago Vergini inside the first 30 seconds.\n\nThe Argentinian’s own goal at St Mary’s had begun their spectacular implosion on that occasion, so his manager must have been relieved to see Phil Dowd not award a penalty when the defender clearly made contact with Fraizer Campbell’s shin.\n\nGiven that Sunderland’s winless run in the Premier League on Monday nights stretched back more than 12 years, there was even more incentive for the hosts. But Poyet’s side, having weathered the early storm, gradually began to find their feet.\n\nTheir opening goal still came as something of a surprise, however, with the Palace defender Brede Hangeland guilty of playing Patrick van Aanholt onside to deliver an inch-perfect cross for Fletcher to head home just after the half-hour mark. Palace were quick to respond as Zaha found space down the right flank and appeared to be brought down by Van Aanholt, even if the initial challenge took place just outside the box.\n\nMuch to Neil Warnock’s chagrin on the touchline, Dowd once again turned down the appeals on what was turning into a frustrating night for the Palace manager. “It’s so disappointing when we’ve played so well – how we’ve lost that game I don’t know,” he said. “The lads couldn’t have given more but we need to start making our own luck. Major decisions change games and we’ve been on the receiving end of some bad ones in the last few matches.”\n\nA different Palace had emerged after half-time, no doubt with their manager’s words still ringing in their ears. Four successive corners eventually came to nothing but it was not long until they were level as all of Poyet’s worst nightmares suddenly returned in an instant. Zaha bamboozled the Sunderland defence with a jinking run before picking out the unmarked Marouane Chamakh at the back post. Somehow, Costel Pantilimon managed to keep it out but when Campbell backheeled the ball back into the danger area, Brown – introduced for the injured Van Aanholt in the first half – inexplicably volleyed into his own net via a post.\n\nThat seemed to be the turning point as Palace pressed on but they had not reckoned upon Gómez’s intervention. A free signing from Wigan in the summer who has been used sparingly by Poyet, the Spaniard has had a knack of scoring crucial goals throughout his career in England. None will feel as crucial to his manager as this one though."}, {"date": "02/11/2014", "arena": "Etihad Stadium", "attendance": 45358, "home_team": {"name": "Manchester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Joe Hart", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pablo Zabaleta", "yellows": [77], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Vincent Kompany", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martín Demichelis", "yellows": [60], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aleksandar Kolarov", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jesus Navas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yaya Touré", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fernando", "yellows": [79], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Milner", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [70]}, {"name": "Sergio Agüero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [63], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [84]}, {"name": "Stevan Jovetic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [71]}], "subs": [{"name": "Bacary Sagna", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Samir Nasri", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [70], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Edin Dzeko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [71], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willy Caballero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gael Clichy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fernandinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [84], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dedryck Boyata", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Manchester United", "lineup": [{"name": "David De Gea", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Antonio Valencia", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Smalling", "yellows": [31], "reds": [39], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marcos Rojo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [56]}, {"name": "Luke Shaw", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daley Blind", "yellows": [28], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marouane Fellaini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adnan Januzaj", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [43]}, {"name": "Ángel di María", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robin van Persie", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [82]}, {"name": "Wayne Rooney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Juan Mata", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Anders Lindegaard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Carrick", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [43], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ander Herrera", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Darren Fletcher", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paddy McNair", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [56], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Wilson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [82], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "It was a derby that left Manchester United a long way back in Manchester City’s wing-mirrors and, in the worst moments, straying dangerously close to being their own worst enemy. They had contributed heavily to their own downfall, most glaringly with the senselessness of Chris Smalling’s red card, and they should know by now that Manuel Pellegrini’s team are not the kind of opponents to pass up these kind of handouts.\n\nSmalling’s quick one-two of yellow cards towards the end of the first half had left an air of inevitability about what would follow and, if anything, it was probably a surprise that City restricted themselves to Sergio Agüero’s goal bearing in mind another of United’s defenders, Marcos Rojo, was taken off on a stretcher early in the second half with a dislocated shoulder. It left Louis van Gaal’s team with a back four of Antonio Valencia, Michael Carrick, Paddy McNair and Luke Shaw. Carrick was playing his first football of the season. Valencia is known more as a low-confidence winger and McNair is a 19-year-old who has been fast-tracked from the youth academy after being spotted at Ballyclare Colts. This might not be City at their fully functioning best but it would have been almost implausible if they had not found their way through.\n\nFor that Smalling will have to do his time grazing in the scapegoat’s paddock because his contribution here supplied hard evidence of a player lacking the football intelligence that is needed at the highest level. He has previous on that front and it is difficult to find any mitigation for the way he scythed down James Milner when the first rule for a defender on a yellow card is not to dive in unless it is absolutely necessary. Smalling’s first booking had come eight minutes earlier for standing in front of Joe Hart to block the goalkeeper’s kick and it is hard to think of too many occasions in the history of this fixture when one of the players has been so hare-brained – or “stupid”, to use Van Gaal’s description.\n\nRemarkably United’s 10 men almost salvaged an improbable draw during a late, spirited challenge. They showed great competitive courage in that period and there were chances for Robin van Persie, Ángel Di María and Marouane Fellaini to punish City for defending too deeply and not being more clinical with their opportunities at the other end. Yet the truth is that City would probably have been coasting by that point if the referee, Michael Oliver, had not turned down three separate penalties, at least two of which could be accurately described as certainties.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Louis van Gaal says defender Chris Smalling was ‘not very smart’ for picking up a second yellow card\n\nWayne Rooney spent much of the game remonstrating with Oliver about his own grievances and, in the interest of balance, there were certainly occasions when United had legitimate complaints. Oliver had an erratic and often bewildering afternoon and, just to pick out one incident, the images of Joe Hart putting his forehead uncomfortably close to the official are certainly far from the norm.\n\nYet the reality is that City had the stronger grievances. United would have been down to nine men if Oliver had made the correct decision when Yaya Touré surged into the penalty area and Rojo, the wrong side of his man, took him down in the last piece of action of the first half. Fellaini had already got away with a risky challenge in the penalty area on Agüero and he was guilty in the second half of the same again. City will feel nonplussed when they review the tape and Pellegrini had to summon all his restraint in the post-match interviews. He did, however, describe it as “unbelievable” and we can only imagine the volume of criticism for Oliver had Agüero’s goal not made it seem more like an irritating sub-plot than the main story.\n\nThe breakthrough came after 63 minutes as United’s unorthodox defence desperately tried to hold off a spell of sustained pressure. Gaël Clichy was galloping down the left and, when Touré played the ball between Valencia and Di María, the visitors’ back line was caught out of shape. Clichy picked out Agüero with a low cross and the Argentinian thumped a rising shot past David de Gea.\n\nDe Gea had been a difficult goalkeeper to beat, keeping out Agüero and Jesús Navas, during an opening half an hour when there was not a great deal between the teams. At that stage City had found it hard to get any real momentum, with Stevan Jovetic not making any real impression and Touré taking his time to get into the match. It was Smalling’s dismissal that changed everything.\n\nVan Gaal responded by replacing Adnan Januzaj with Carrick and, in fairness, the emergency centre-half did exceedingly well given that he has not played since May. McNair also acquitted himself well after Rojo was injured sliding into a challenge with Martín Demichelis – moments after Fellaini had been guilty of pulling out of one – and Van Gaal was entitled, for the most part, to recognise his team’s personality. “Our problem is we give the ball away too often.”\n\nHart had to make two splendid saves as Van Persie and Di María took aim and Fellaini should really have done better with a headed chance. City, however, had accumulated many more scoring opportunities, with Milner excelling before his substitution, Touré and Fernando becoming increasingly influential and Navas striking the post when he had the chance to double the lead.\n\nIt leaves United contemplating their worst start to a season, with 13 points from 10 games, since Ron Atkinson was sacked at the corresponding stage in 1986. It was City’s sixth win in their last seven league meetings against United, including four in a row for the first time since 1970, and Van Gaal’s expression suggested that he had not accepted Smalling’s apology. Smalling had been “very humble”, according to Van Gaal, but there was no sympathy here. “Not so smart,” as the Dutchman put it.\n\nMan of the match Sergio Agüero (Manchester City)"}, {"date":

have been as the post-match inquest inevitably focused on the flashpoint midway through the second half when Christian Benteke raised a hand to the face of Ryan Mason and invited a red card. There was no real malice or physical force behind Benteke’s actions but the striker was playing with fire and the consequences for Villa were dire.\n\nNeil Swarbrick had little option but to send the Villa striker off – only the referee knows why Mason escaped similar punishment for putting his head into Benteke’s face in the lead-up to that incident – and the complexion of the game completely changed. Tottenham Hotspur, who were trailing to Andreas Weimann’s first-half goal and looked desperately poor for long periods, accepted the lifeline and struck twice in the final six minutes, first through Nacer Chadli and then courtesy of their man of the moment.\n\nHarry Kane, who has yet to start a Premier League game this season despite scoring eight times in cup football, came off the substitutes’ bench to hit the winner and further endear himself to the travelling supporters who had been singing his name as early as the first half. Érik Lamela must have fancied his chances when Spurs were awarded a free-kick 25 yards from goal in the 90th minute but Kane took charge of the situation and his right-footed shot deflected off Nathan Baker to leave Brad Guzan stranded.\n\nThere was no way back for Villa, who have now lost six consecutive league matches, their worst run since 1967. This latest defeat was particularly hard for Paul Lambert to stomach because of the way the match slipped through his players’ fingers as a result of the Benteke dismissal. The Villa manager said that while he understood Benteke’s reaction, given the striker had been provoked, he could not condone his player’s actions. A three-match suspension will now follow.\n\nIt was an incident that had been brewing in a match that became tetchy and fractious early in the second half as the challenges started to fly in and tempers boiled over. Jan Vertonghen incensed the Villa players with a two-footed tackle on Ashley Westwood that earned the Spurs defender a yellow card.\n\nNot long afterwards came the Benteke red card. The Belgian was initially tangling for the ball with Lamela close to the touchline and there was some shoulder-barging going on before Mason got involved. The Spurs midfielder took exception to Benteke’s behaviour and squared up to him, going head to head. It was at that point that Benteke snapped, lifted his right hand and swiped Mason in the face. A mêlée ensued before Swarbrick eventually brought some order and dismissed Benteke.\n\nAfterwards Mauricio Pochettino was asked whether he understood the expression “to get out of jail”. The Spurs manager had done well to keep a straight face a few minutes earlier when he claimed that his team deserved to win. Vulnerable at the back, where Benteke caused Younès Kaboul no end of problems in the first half, devoid of ideas in midfield – Pochettino withdrew Christian Eriksen at half-time – and toothless up front before Kane’s introduction, Spurs have plenty of work to do on this evidence.\n\nVilla had got off to the best possible start when Weimann scored in the 16th minute. It was Villa’s first goal in nine hours and seven minutes of football and brought no little relief. Charles N’Zogbia rode a weak challenge from Danny Rose on the Villa right before delivering a low cross into the area that Weimann, sliding on a greasy surface, stuck out a leg to steer inside the near post.\n\nBenteke had already gone close on two occasions. A diving header from the marauding Matt Lowton’s cross should have been buried but drifted wide and two minutes later Benteke struck a left-footed shot from the edge of the penalty area against the angle of crossbar and post. Later in the half he towered above Kaboul but headed Aly Cissokho’s deep free-kick over the bar.\n\nSpurs, however, should have levelled when Emmanuel Adebayor sprinted clear in the 28th minute but the Togolese, who started alongside Roberto Soldado forthe first time this season, did not hit his shot with any conviction and Guzan got down low to his right to turn the ball behind.\n\nPochettino threw his water bottle down in disgust and Spurs fans made their own feelings known by calling for Kane.\n\nEven with their numerical advantage, Spurs were struggling to make much impression but then came the breakthrough when Chadli arrived at the back post unattended to turn in Lamela’s corner. It was left to Kane to twist the knife with his deflected free-kick."}, {"date": "01/11/2014", "arena": "St James' Park, Newcastle", "attendance": 52166, "home_team": {"name": "Newcastle United", "lineup": [{"name": "Tim Krul", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daryl Janmaat", "yellows": [62], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Taylor", "yellows": [45], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fabricio Coloccini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paul Dummett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mehdi Abeid", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Colback", "yellows": [79], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gabriel Obertan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [27]}, {"name": "Moussa Sissoko", "yellows": [49], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sammy Ameobi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [66]}, {"name": "Papiss Cisse", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}], "subs": [{"name": "Ryan Taylor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yoan Gouffran", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rolando Aarons", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [27], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ayoze Pérez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [73], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Massadio Haidara", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rémy Cabella", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [66], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rob Elliot", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Liverpool", "lineup": [{"name": "Simon Mignolet", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Glen Johnson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Skrtel", "yellows": [44], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dejan Lovren", "yellows": [89], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Raheem Sterling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Gerrard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordan Henderson", "yellows": [72], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Allen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [66]}, {"name": "Alberto Moreno", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Philippe Coutinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [80]}, {"name": "Mario Balotelli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Brad Jones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kolo Touré", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rickie Lambert", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [80], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Javi Manquillo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Lallana", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Emre Can", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fabio Borini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [66], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Stoppage time was drawing to a close when Alan Pardew permitted himself a little smile and discreetly pumped a fist. Barely a fortnight ago anyone seeking the perfect definition of the term “dead man walking” needed look no further than Newcastle United’s manager but four successive victories – three in the Premier League – have altered his landscape beyond recognition.\n\nThere was certainly no arguing with the Newcastle fan dressed as a skeleton who stood behind the home dugout at the end wearing a Halloween mask and bearing a placard declaring: “Pardew: back from the dead.”\n\nMuch more of this and, rather than being sacked, English football’s answer to Lazarus will be challenging for another manager-of-the-year award. He certainly succeeded in outwitting his old friend Brendan Rodgers – once his youth coach at Reading – on an afternoon when Ayoze Pérez’s winning goal emphasised Liverpool’s disappointing inability to cope with Newcastle’s formidably fleet-footed counterattacking.\n\nPardew has remodelled Newcastle into a beautifully calibrated 4-3-3 formation which balances his side’s fantastic pace with latterly absent defensive organisation.\n\nIf the emergence of Pérez could not have been more timely, Mehdi Abeid, making his first Premier League start, shone in midfield alongside the outstanding Moussa Sissoko.\n\n“If you’re Newcastle manager it’s not all gin and tonics and aperitifs,” said a smiling Pardew. “There’ll be rough days. Bobby Robson had some dark days here.\n\n“But I always knew we had good spirit and talent and it’ll be fantastic in the town tonight. I might even go into the city myself – it’ll be the first time in a while!”\n\nWith their new configuration clearly suiting them Newcastle could have won an early penalty when Gabriel Obertan accelerated down the right and picked out Sissoko, who promptly had his heel clipped by Joe Allen. While Andre Marriner was not quite convinced, the good news for Pardew was that his players were clearly buying into a gameplan revolving around rapid changes of pace as Newcastle oscillated between tight defence and lightning breaks.\n\nThe manner in which Abeid, Sissoko and Jack Colback suffocated much of Liverpool’s passing at source impressed but the team’s collective resolve was fully epitomised when Daryl Janmaat sprinted several yards to steal the ball from Jordan Henderson with a tremendous tackle.\n\nEven when injury deprived Pardew of Obertan there was little respite for Liverpool, who found themselves instead confronted by Rolando Aarons’s equally intimidating pace.\n\nLike Newcastle, Rodgers’s side are in transition but their adaptation to life after Luis Suárez seems at a painful juncture. Anfield’s class of 2014-15 created only one first-half chance when Martin Skrtel directed a powerful header narrowly wide from Steven Gerrard’s corner.\n\nRestored to a deeper, more central role than in recent months, Sissoko looks a midfielder reborn. His fine dribble late in the first half resulted in a slightly desperate challenge from Skrtel but Papiss Cissé – who earlier had a shot cleared off the line by Glen Johnson – squandered the subsequent free-kick, ballooning the ball over Simon Mignolet’s bar.\n\nApparently unsure how to react to Newcastle’s tactics Liverpool were reduced to looking distinctly ordinary and, sometimes, downright untidy. Raheem Sterling in particular cannot have expected to find himself shackled so comprehensively by Paul Dummett.\n\nShafts of Merseyside sunshine were rare, although Mario Balotelli did test Tim Krul with a deceptively swerving free-kick early in the second half.\n\nThe Italian – whose principal first-half contribution was giving Johnson an apparent tactical lecture while Obertan was treated – emerged very late for the second half but should not be made a scapegoat for Liverpool’s shortcomings here. Some of Balotelli’s off-the-ball movement was clever enough but, with Sterling ineffective and the midfield malfunctioning, it was asking a lot to expect him to win the game single-handed. And at least he refrained from rising to provocation after being hacked down by first Janmaat then Abeid in swift succession.\n\nPhilippe Coutinho came closest to scoring for the visitors, his second-half header forcing Krul into a fine save. By then Cissé had been forced off with knee trouble but Pardew had a more-than-able replacement in Pérez who proceeded to score his second goal in six days.\n\nPouncing on Alberto Moreno’s failure to clear Sissoko’s low cross following a one-two with Dummett, the 21-year-old, £1.5m signing from Tenerife intervened to incisive effect, hooking the ball home from close range. Pérez subsequently very nearly created a second for Rémy Cabella after playing a quick one-two with his fellow substitute but Mignolet rescued Liverpool, saving smartly with his legs.\n\n“I didn’t think we deserved to lose,” said Rodgers, who thought Sissoko might have been sent off for a bad tackle on Allen. “But we didn’t do enough to win.”"}, {"date": "01/11/2014", "arena": "Emirates

Pace, skill, attitude and, happily for Arsenal, Alexis Sánchez also had room for the decisive moment. Arsène Wenger’s players must have acted out this script a hundred times – stepping on to the front foot in an attempt to break the visiting minnow. And putting the crowd through the wringer as they struggle to make their superiority count.\n\nSeventy minutes were on the stadium clock when Sánchez had seen enough and decided to bend the contest to his will. Calum Chambers stood up a deep cross from the right and Sánchez burst in between Kieran Trippier and Michael Duff to leap and thump a header back into the corner of the net. As Wenger noted afterwards, it was a goal that showcased Sánchez’s insatiable desire.\n\nFinally, Arsenal could relax and they set about giving the scoreline a more appropriate look. Chambers scored his first goal for the club when he fired home after Danny Welbeck’s shot had been cleared off the line by David Jones but the final word deserved to go to one man only.\n\nAfter the substitute Lukas Podolski had forced one brilliant save from Tom Heaton and rattled the post with another volley, Sánchez met Kieran Gibbs’ left-wing cross, took one touch, then another and slotted home his 10th goal of the season. The £31m fee that brought him from Barcelona is looking more and more like outstanding value.\n\nThere was even the boost for Arsenal of seeing Theo Walcott enter as a late substitute for his first appearance since 4 January – he laid on one of Podolski’s chances – but for Burnley the wait for the first victory of the season goes on.\n\nThey have now played seven of the current top 10 in their 10 Premier League matches so far and, to borrow a phrase from Sean Dyche, the manager, they are “not ready for this market.” Dyche talked about how Burnley had spent only £6m in the summer and, in August of last year, they had sold the striker Charlie Austin to Queens Park Rangers for £4m to keep the club afloat. The subtext was clear: how are Burnley supposed to compete at the home of Champions League regulars?\n\nThe strength of Wenger’s substitutes’ bench was also not lost on Dyche and if Burnley could lament the softness of the first two concessions – Chambers’ goal had stemmed from a poorly defended corner – they could have zero complaints about the result, which kept them pinned to the foot of the Premier League table with four points and five goals. “They put us to the sword after the first goal,” Dyche said.\n\nHe did have the gumption, as ever, to start with two strikers, Danny Ings playing in the space behind Marvin Sordell but it was one-way traffic for much of the afternoon. Arsenal, though, had to wait for the breakthrough, despite the relentlessness of Sánchez, who looked like a PlayStation player with the speed button held down. Wenger played him off Welbeck – he described his formation as being 4-4-2 – and Sánchez was at the heart of everything. “He looks more goal dangerous through the middle,” Wenger said.\n\nArsenal created first-half chances. Sánchez forced Heaton into two smart saves and he curled another shot narrowly wide while Welbeck saw a goal-bound shot hit Trippier, with Heaton seemingly beaten and Santi Cazorla banged a volley off-target.\n\nThere was also penalty controversy in the 21st minute. From Cazorla’s right-wing corner, George Boyd seemed to mistime his jump at the near post and he flung up his hand and pawed at the ball. There was contact, which distracted the onrushing Per Mertesacker behind him and everybody in Arsenal colours waited for the inevitable flag from the assistant referee David Bryan. The incident was on his side of the field. Yet there was no decision. Mertesacker and Cazorla shared the prize for the most disbelieving Arsenal player.\n\nDyche never left his post at the very edge of his technical area and his team enjoyed encouragement at the beginning of the second half. It had been backs-to-the-wall for the overwhelming majority of the first period but Burnley began to piece together patches of possession. Ings flickered and there was the moment when he almost got in as Wojciech Szczesny embarked on a dash from his line that always felt risky. Mertesacker tidied up the situation.\n\nDyche repeatedly gestured for calm but his heart pounded. As the minutes ticked by, he edged closer to a tonic. His hopes were raised when Duff produced a magnificent block to deny Cazorla when the big chance seemed to have opened up from Chambers’ knock-back. Was it going to be Burnley’s day?\n\nSánchez had other ideas."}, {"date": "01/11/2014", "arena": "Stamford Bridge", "attendance": 41486, "home_team": {"name": "Chelsea", "lineup": [{"name": "Thibaut Courtois", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Branislav Ivanovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gary Cahill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Terry", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Filipe Luis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cesc Fàbregas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nemanja Matic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willian", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [64]}, {"name": "Oscar", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [32], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eden Hazard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [75], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Diego Costa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [78]}], "subs": [{"name": "Kurt Zouma", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathan Aké", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ramires", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Didier Drogba", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [64], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mohamed Salah", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Petr Cech", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "André Schürrle", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [78], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Queens Park Rangers", "lineup": [{"name": "Robert Green", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mauricio Isla", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Richard Dunne", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Caulker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Suk-Young Yun", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eduardo Vargas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Karl Henry", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sandro", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Junior Hoilett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [60]}, {"name": "Leroy Fer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [84]}, {"name": "Charlie Austin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [62], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Armand Traore", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [84], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Clint Hill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matt Phillips", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shaun Wright-Phillips", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Niko Kranjcar", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Brian Murphy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bobby Zamora", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [60], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Chelsea continue to set the pace at the top of the Premier League but their stride does not look unbreakable. José Mourinho knows that, which is why he spent much of this west London derby seething on the sidelines, his team requiring a late penalty to overcome a lowly but tenacious Queen Park Rangers side.\n\n“My team did not play well, or well enough,” huffed Mourinho. “It was not what I was expecting. We had periods of good football, but not consistently. I was expecting more. There is no doubt we deserve the points but one thing is to deserve and another is to deserve and play very well, which we didn’t.”\n\nChelsea were mostly dominant but at times sloppy. They seemed capable of blowing away visitors who had suffered heavy defeats in all of their away trips this season, yet they also betrayed a fragility that meant they wound up grateful to cling on to all three points. Their spluttering irritated their manager. “It was periods, 10 to 15 minutes here, 10 to 15 minutes there,” said Mourinho. “We were playing against a very well organised defensive team where everyone knew the job they had to do. It was fantastic work by Harry and they gave us a tough match. But with our quality I would expect us to be stronger.”\n\nMourinho had deployed his most powerful available line-up, with the fit-again Diego Costa returning to the side after almost a month out, as Chelsea made no concession to the forthcoming trip to Maribor in the Champions League nor next weekend’s showdown with Liverpool. Mourinho evidently wants his team to continue stretching their lead in the Premier League, especially after last weekend’s last-minute stumble at Old Trafford. At first it seemed that QPR would be submissive opponents, as the visitors surrendered possession straight from kick-off, inviting two minutes of pressure during which Chelsea threatened with three successive corners.\n\nIt soon transpired, however, that Rangers were in obstinate mood and, with Sandro excelling at the base of a five-man central midfield, Chelsea toiled to create chances despite near-constant possession. Sporadic counterattacks by the visitors even evoked memories of Rangers’ last visit here, in January 2013, when they pilfered a 1-0 victory.\n\nCosta looked short of sharpness but did produce a foxy drag-back and pass in the 10th minute to dink the ball to Oscar, who dabbed a soft shot wide from 12 yards. A minute later, the ever-dangerous full-back Branislav Ivanovic made the stealthy run of a natural predator to collect a through-ball from Willian, but then spared his quarry by shooting into the side netting from close range.\n\nGenerally, however, QPR were doing a fair job at keeping their hosts at bay and, in the 15th minute, they served warning of their own menace when Charlie Austin headed just over the bar following a cross from Junior Hoilett.\n\nEden Hazard was seeing plenty of the ball and producing some sumptuous touches but not penetrating. It took a mistake by Eduardo Vargas in the 25th minute to create another opening for the home team, with Cesc Fàbregas pouncing on the Chilean’s loose pass before forcing a save from Rob Green from 25 yards. Seven minutes later, the goalkeeper was left bewildered by Oscar, who ran in from the right wing to receive a pass from Fàbregas and flip the ball into the far corner of the net with the outside of his foot. It was an exquisite finish. As the crowd cooed over the Brazilian’s skill, Mourinho bore an expression that seemed to say “about time.”\n\nQPR emerged from half-time with more attacking intent. They pressed Chelsea back in the early minutes of the second period, causing Mourinho to fume further. Surrendering the initiative at Manchester City and United was bad enough; the prospect of doing it at home to QPR seemed intolerable for the Portuguese.\n\nWillian might have soothed his manager by setting up a killer second goal in the 54th minute but instead over-hit an intended pass to Hazard, who lunged but could not connect with the ball seven yards from goal.\n\nHarry Redknapp introduced Bobby Zamora on the hour to give Charlie Austin company up front. Two minutes later Austin equalised. It was a wonderful finish, too, as Leroy Fer fired a bouncing shot at goal from 20 yards and the striker, standing eight yards out, applied a backflick that wrongfooted Thibaut Courtois. In the end Chelsea needed help to secure the win – and, not for the first time this season, Redknapp’s men came to their opponent’s aid, Vargas giving away a penalty with a witless shunt on Hazard in the 75th minute. Redknapp complained that it was just a “shoulder charge”, but the challenge was reckless. And from the spot Hazard was ruthless. But Mourinho knows that stronger teams are unlikely to show such vulnerability."}, {"date": "01/11/2014", "arena": "Goodison Park", "attendance": 39149, "home_team": {"name": "Everton", "lineup": [{"name": "Tim Howard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Seamus Coleman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Antolin Alcaraz", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [32]}, {"name": "Phil Jagielka", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leighton Baines", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James McCarthy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gareth Barry", "yellows": [38], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aiden McGeady", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [68]}, {"name": "Steven Naismith", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [68]}, {"name": "Ross Barkley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Samuel Eto'o", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Joel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tony Hibbert", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Romelu Lukaku", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [68], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Muhamed Besic", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [32], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Atsu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leon Osman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Pienaar", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [68], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Swansea City", "lineup": [{"name": "Lukasz Fabianski", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Angel Rangel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Federico Fernandez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Williams", "yellows": [54], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Neil Taylor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonjo Shelvey", "yellows": [24], "reds": [72], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sung-Yueng Ki", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wayne Routledge", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gylfi Sigurdsson", "yellows": [66], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [76]}, {"name": "Jefferson Montero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [79]}, {"name": "Wilfried Bony", "yellows": [33], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [61]}], "subs": [{"name": "Marvin Emnes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathan Dyer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [79], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Carroll", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [76], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bafétimbi Gomis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [61], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gerhard Tremmel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Bartley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Liam Shephard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Swansea City revealed their other face here, the defensive, gritty side that is not averse to a red card and makes a priority of points above appeasing the purists. It left Roberto Martínez bemused at the intentions of his former club but, more importantly, halted the momentum of his current one as Everton failed to unnerve Garry Monk’s resilient 10 men.\n\nJonjo Shelvey became the second Swansea player to see red on Merseyside in five days when dismissed for a second bookable offence with 18 minutes remaining of this sterile goalless draw. Unlike at Anfield in the Capital One Cup on Tuesday, when Federico Fernández received a late red card that was subsequently rescinded, there was no adverse reaction, drama or heartache for the visitors despite a flurry of half-chances for substitute Romelu Lukaku.\n\nThe Belgium striker failed to connect with a Samuel Eto’o cross in front of goal in stoppage time and deflected a goal-bound drive from Leighton Baines wide as Everton tried to take advantage of Shelvey’s foolishness, but guile, inspiration and quality was lacking from the home side and the chance of a third successive Premier League win was lost.\n\n“It was a bad game from an attacking point of view,” said Martínez. “The red card went against us in that it allowed Swansea to defend even deeper with nine men and the goalkeeper. It wasn’t a performance you associate with Swansea and you have to give them credit for how they defended. The sending off gave them a clear role, one that was not about having the ball, and it was strange to see a Swansea performance like that.”\n\nNot that a change in tactics troubled Monk, the man Martínez appointed as Swansea captain while in charge in south Wales. Everton dominated possession and showed clearer intent, but Lukasz Fabianski was hardly tested in the visitors’ goal.\n\n“Defensively we were brilliant,” the Swansea manager said. “We’ve always played good, attractive football but there have been times even when I was playing that I thought we didn’t do enough defensively. That is something I’ve introduced this season. We have needed it at times.”\n\nSwansea were content to absorb pressure and hit Everton on the counterattack, a policy that should have paid off on five minutes when the returning Gylfi Sigurdsson and Wilfried Bony combined to break Baines’s offside trap. Bony was clean through on the right of Tim Howard’s area when Sigurdsson flicked the ball around Phil Jagielka but the striker hesitated over his shot before firing wide of the near post.\n\nThat was an early let-off for Everton and a major one arrived when Antolín Alcaraz escaped with a clear handball when diving on to Shelvey’s shot midway through the first half. The goalkeeper impersonation convinced the referee, Kevin Friend, and play continued. Swansea’s luck on key decisions shows no sign of improving, although Shelvey’s second-half dismissal was purely self-inflicted.\n\nMonk, who met the referees’ chiefs, Mike Riley and Howard Webb, for clarification on several contentious issues on Friday, said: “I didn’t know you are allowed to play with two goalkeepers. It was a great save from Alcaraz, he had a strong wrist and I’ll be showing that to my keepers in training next week. It was a clear penalty. We all saw it but unfortunately the referee didn’t.”\n\nShelvey, booked in the first half for kicking the ball away, invited dismissal with a body-check on James McCarthy, but for all their pressure, breaks in the area and numerical advantage Everton drew a blank at home for the first time this season. “We just didn’t move the ball quickly enough or make the right calls when it mattered,” Martínez said."}, {"date": "01/11/2014", "arena": "KCOM Stadium", "attendance": 22828, "home_team": {"name": "Hull City", "lineup": [{"name": "Eldin Jakupovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [],

things are going to get serious for Southampton. Terrace renditions of “We’re going to win the league,” may have to be chorused with tongues extracted from cheeks.\n\nA sixth clean sheet of their Premier League season ensured maximum return from what appeared to be an onerous fixture on the Humber. The one goal required came courtesy of Victor Wanyama’s wondrous piece of opportunism after their high-pressing forced a mistake from Eldin Jakupovic, the error-prone Hull goalkeeper.\n\nFlustered by an under-hit pass back from Robbie Brady, a makeshift left-back, the one-cap Swiss international shanked his third-minute clearance straight to the feet of the former Celtic midfielder Wanyama, who swept it first time back over the goalkeeper’s head. The clinical nature of the finish epitomised Southampton’s display, and left their manager, Ronald Koeman, to consider their title credentials.\n\n“Maybe, maybe,” he said, laughing. “I’m always positive. But to continue winning, to continue up the table, why not? The expectation is high and I like that because we would like to win something. If you win games you have good possibilities, maybe to play in Europe. If we keep like this it can be a great season.”\n\nWhen £90m worth of talent left St Mary’s in the summer and Mauricio Pochettino departed to Tottenham there was seemingly only one way to go for the club. Yet they sit in second place three months in and have also progressed to the last eight of the Capital One Cup.\n\nSteve Bruce, whose Hull team inconvenienced Arsenal and Liverpool in their previous outings, reckons Southampton were comfortably the best of the rest in 2013-14 but the departure of Adam Lallana, Rickie Lambert, Luke Shaw and Dejan Lovren has hardly been a loss at all thanks to canny recruitment.\n\n“They are a very good side and arguably as good as they were, so the manager and the people behind the scenes need a big pat on the back,” Bruce said. “What they have let go has been replaced by real quality. The two full-backs for them were really terrific.”\n\nNathaniel Clyne and Ryan Bertrand, the players in question, chose an opportune moment to shine – it was Roy Hodgson’s first Premier League visit to the KC Stadium. The Southampton goalkeeper, Fraser Forster, another in contention to feature in the Euro 2014 qualifiers, can rarely have been as well protected.\n\nThat Southampton took one of two chances created in the first period – Shane Long, their £12m acquisition from Hull, saw Jakupovic block the other – reflected the clinical nature of their play this season.\n\nSouthampton could have won by a greater margin but for a rare off-day for their new-look attack. Graziano Pellè’s timing was out a minute from the end when he swung his boot at Sadio Mané’s low cross, guiding it narrowly the wrong side of the post. Earlier, Mané also made a hash of a golden chance in the 69th minute when he looped Dusan Tadic’s pass into the turf and over the bar from inside the six-yard box.\n\nThat the Saints maintained their march on Chelsea’s coattails came down to the latest howler by Hull’s third-choice goalkeeper. On his last league appearance here, 21 months ago, Jakupovic fumbled Miguel Llera’s corner into his own net to send Sheffield Wednesday home with a surprise Championship victory.\n\nWith Allan McGregor and Steve Harper sidelined through injury, Jakupovic was integral to Liverpool being blanked at Anfield a week ago but panic spread whenever Southampton closed the ball down deep in home territory. Redemption of sorts came when he foiled Steven Davis with an unconventional stop in the second period.\n\nBut this particular Southampton side needs only one chance."}, {"date": "01/11/2014", "arena":

but the West Bromwich Albion manager, Alan Irvine, appears to be reaping the benefits of fielding a settled side. In the Baggies’ past six Premier League games, Irvine has used 12 outfield starters, and three wins and two draws in that time means his side have picked up 11 points from 18.\n\nThe contrast with Leicester City is marked, and arguably instructive. They have now gone five games without a win since beating Manchester United 5-3 here on 21 September – failing to score in four of them –and their manager, Nigel Pearson, has chopped and changed players in every one.\n\nIt is true, as Pearson pointed out, that Leicester looked much improved on their tame 2-0 defeat away to Swansea City last Saturday, and that luck played a considerable part in their defeat by West Bromwich Albion – most obviously in the second-half own goal, when the Leicester centre-half Wes Morgan headed an attempted clearance against Esteban Cambiasso and the ball rebounded past the wrong-footed goalkeeper, Kasper Schmeichel, and into the net.\n\nHowever, as Pearson also acknowledged, his side again struggled to create opportunities, despite returning to the midfield diamond formation, with Cambiasso at the base, which they had employed in the success against Manchester United. “As a contrast to last week, there were a lot of positives,” Pearson said. “You could certainly argue that we were unlucky in what was always going to be a relatively tight game.\n\n“We looked more solid, more disciplined, the work ethic was there, and while we didn’t create too many opportunities, we were reasonably comfortable. It’s more what I’m looking for, without a shadow of a doubt.”\n\nLeicester certainly made a more obviously purposeful start than of late, forcing the visitors on to the back foot. The Baggies looked solid in defence, though, and, playing on the break, more dangerous in attack.\n\nSaido Berahino twice came close to beating the offside trap before finally doing so, only for Schmeichel to save his shot from the edge of the penalty area, while Leicester’s best chance of the first half-hour was when Morgan headed wide from Matty James’s corner.\n\nSet pieces continued to be Leicester’s likeliest source of goals, while, at the other end, another swift break resulted in Berahino laying the ball off for Chris Brunt to fizz a drive just over Schmeichel’s crossbar.\n\nEven so, it was not entirely surprising that it took an own goal, shortly after the restart, to break the stalemate.\n\n“It was fortunate, but it was a good move that lead to it,” said Irvine, referring to the manner in which Berahino pulled the ball back across the Leicester penalty area.\n\nWith their unbeaten home record now firmly under threat, the Foxes picked up the pace. Vardy shot straight at the Albion goalkeeper, Ben Foster, and was also close to getting on the end of a David Nugent cross, after a move that began with Marcin Wasilewski flooring Berahino with a swinging elbow to the jaw. The Pole was fortunate in the extreme that the referee, Stuart Attwell, back in the Premier League, either did not see it or unaccountably chose to take no action.\n\nPearson brought on Leonardo Ulloa, still the club’s top scorer, with five league goals, despite having failed to score in his past four appearances.\n\nHe soon created Leicester’s best chance, with a cross that Craig Gardner inadvertently glanced straight on to the head of Andy King. The midfielder had only Foster to beat from six yards out, but directed his header straight at the goalkeeper.\n\nFor all that Leicester threw men forward in the final few minutes, the impression remained that they would need a fortunate break to equalise: it never came."}, {"date": "01/11/2014", "arena": "Bet365 Stadium", "attendance": 27174, "home_team": {"name": "Stoke City", "lineup":

getting older and we didn’t win,” the Stoke manager harrumphed. “So it’s not a particularly good combination.”\n\nEnner Valencia and Stewart Downing engineered a character-full comeback from 2-0 down to extend West Ham’s excellent start to the season, equalling their best since 1983-84. Amassing 17 points from their opening 10 games to sit fifth in the Premier League table, above Liverpool and Manchester United, is testament to the quality in depth that Sam Allardyce has built, and a style of play that may yet warm the cockles of Hammers’ hearts.\n\nWest Ham’s resurgence is also one in the eye for those who would have had the blunt West Midlander removed from office at the end of last season, and shows what standing by a good man can do. “The extra quality we’ve got this season has helped us get a point that was hard-earned if not necessarily deserved,” Allardyce said. “That’s about what a top-half team has to do to get something out of the game when you’re not necessarily deserving it. It speaks volumes for the character of the team.”\n\nIt had all looked so much a case of what comes after the Lord Mayor’s show as West Ham, having beaten Manchester City 2-1 last Saturday, went 2-0 down, Stoke taking control with goals from Victor Moses and Mame Diouf.\n\nBojan Krkic, retaining his starting place, was instrumental in this fine start. Moses scored in the 33rd minute after Geoff Cameron’s cross towards Diouf fell for the diminutive former Barcelona player to shoot against James Collins, only for Moses to scramble the ball over the line for his first goal for the club. Diouf and Steve Sidwell should have made it 2-0 just before half-time but the game looked safe when the former headed home Jonathan Walters’ superb left-footed cross in the 56th minute.\n\nBut West Ham got back into the game with a goal that came seconds after a two-footed tackle by Alex Song that could have caused serious damage had Diouf not taken evasive action.\n\n“It’s a poor challenge,” Hughes said, before going on to criticise the referee, Chris Foy. “He’s out of control and it’s a good job Mame jumped out the way. The referee should have stopped the game there and then. But they went up the other end and scored. I thought referees were meant to stamp out, for want of a better phrase, those sort of challenges. He’s one of our senior referees so he’s got to do better than that.”\n\nInstead, Collins played the ball out to Downing, who scampered away from two men down the right wing before delivering a delicious centre that swerved past two defenders for Valencia to dive in and head home. Only Cesc Fàbregas started the day with more chances created in the Premier League than Downing.\n\nThe game became a trade of opportunities, with neither team able to control the centre of the field, before Diouf headed Erik Pieters’ free-kick wide when scoring looked the easier option.\n\nStoke were left to rue that miss when Downing drilled home from 10 yards with 17 minutes remaining from Valencia’s left-wing cross.\n\nThis had looked a banker for a low-or-no-scoring draw, with West Ham’s Diafra Sakho’s chance to become the first man to score in his first seven Premier League games postponed by a shoulder injury and Peter Crouch suspended for the home side, but instead we had a relative goal-fest."}, {"date": "27/10/2014", "arena": "Kiyan Prince Foundation Stadium",

Harry Redknapp has cut a disconsolate figure for the most part this season but two goals from Charlie Austin lifted his side off the foot of the Premier League and also lifted the gloom that had been hovering over the London club following a week of internal mudslinging.\n\nAnd all without Adel Taarabt, the Moroccan midfielder whose weight has dominated headlines this past week and even prompted Tony Fernandes, the Rangers chairman, to speak to both player and manager about bringing embarrassment on the club.\n\nTaarabt was not needed against an insipid Aston Villa. With Austin, who scored either side of half-time, and Bobby Zamora, QPR caused their opponents enough problems, Villa unable to cope with the physical threat and lacking any attacking ideas of their own. Paul Lambert’s side have now lost five games in succession and have not scored in any of those defeats.\n\nThey started well but except for a single 15-minute spell they showed little sign of breaking QPR’s resistance. In defence Ron Vlaar was left wanting when up against Zamora while Austin’s movement was too much for a team bereft of confidence.\n\n“I thought the two goals we lost were really poor,” said Lambert. “I think that is the most we have had of the ball, possession-wise, but that is why I’m never one for stats. The main stat is putting the ball in the net and keeping it out. I thought we defended poorly for the two goals. We have got to be more clinical in the last third of the pitch but the two goals are disappointing because we had most of the ball.”\n\nOn his side’s lack of goals, Lambert added: “I tend not to get them down on that. They will come out of the traps on Sunday [against Tottenham] and I know we are going to be all right in that department because, when Benteke gets up to speed and, with Agbonlahor, Weimann, N’Zogbia and Bent, there are guys there with goals in them and it will happen.”\n\nFor Redknapp, though, the emotions were contrasting following a much-needed victory that allowed QPR to climb above Burnley to 19th in the table.\n\nTheir defence was all at sea for the opening 15 minutes but they survived the early pressure despite an array of sloppy mistakes. First it was Yun Suk-young who stumbled in possession and gave away a corner, then on the opposite flank Mauricio Isla’s heavy back-pass forced Robert Green into a hasty clearance. Ashley Westwood shot straight at Green and Villa’s bright young midfielder Carlos Sánchez volleyed at the Rangers goalkeeper after 15 minutes.\n\nWhen QPR’s first goal came, it was against the run of play. They had, in fact, barely threatened but Richard Dunne’s raking long ball from defence found its target in Zamora, the striker beating Vlaar in the air and laying the ball off to Austin, whose shot was low and pure into Brad Guzan’s bottom right corner.\n\n“It was an excellent performance, I thought we did ever so well,” said Redknapp. “They started to get a bit of the ball in the second half and dominate the possession but I felt when we changed it and we tightened up in the middle then suddenly we started getting hold of the ball and I thought we dominated then. Overall I thought we deserved the win.”\n\nIt is not difficult to understand why Villa have failed to break opponents down recently. Granted their recent run of defeats has come against teams at the top end of the division but too often Christian Benteke was left isolated here, with only gabriel Agbonlahor providing any semblance of attacking verve in the final third.\n\nAnd when the opportunities did come, they were squandered. A free-kick from deep was hung up to the far post in the 56th minute, aimed at Benteke, and the Belgian forward nodded the ball across goal to Ciaran Clark. However, the centre-half was unable to make decisive contact from inside the six-yard box. Benteke and Joe Cole later got in each other’s way when attacking a cross from the right.\n\nJunior Hoilett was brought on by QPR with a little over an hour played and almost made an immediate impact, drifting in from the left and curling a delightful effort that rebounded back off a post. Rangers’ second was again a simple goal, but brilliantly executed. In the 69th minute Sánchez, so bright in the opening half, gave the ball away in midfield and Vargas broke swiftly down the right, pulling it back to the near post where Austin sprinted across his marker to finish deftly."}, {"date": "26/10/2014", "arena": "Turf Moor", "attendance": 19927, "home_team": {"name": "Burnley", "lineup": [{"name": "Tom Heaton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals":

to salute Martin Dobson, the 1970s stalwart who won four England caps during his distinguished Burnley career. Many offered another standing ovation at the end, applauding a four-times African Footballer of the Year. Players of the class of Samuel Eto’o have been strangers to Turf Moor for much of the past four decades and, even in his dotage, he was dominant against an increasingly beleaguered Burnley side.\n\nA game bookended by his wonderfully taken goals brought a second successive win for Everton. Eight days after they were perched precariously above the relegation zone, they clambered into the top half of the table.\n\nPerhaps as pertinently Eto’o belied the notion that both Merseyside clubs’ fates rest with a lone forward. A Liverpool target in the summer, Eto’o took his tally for Everton to four goals in five starts, which is more than Brendan Rodgers’ strikers have mustered between them this season. Not for the first time Liverpool may be left to rue one who got away.\n\nBut such has been the focus on Romelu Lukaku, such was the size of his club-record transfer fee, that Eto’o has been somewhat obscured as an Evertonian –but not at Turf Moor and, as both he and his youthful sidekick, Lukaku, scored, Burnley were left with a familiar lament.\n\n“The game was decided on high-quality players doing what high-quality players do,” said their manager, Sean Dyche. “They showed a clinical edge.”\n\nHis side did not. If the days when Eto’o was the most feared No9 in the world game are long gone, along with the pace that made him so prolific for Barcelona, his finishing remains outstanding and his footballing brain has allowed Roberto Martínez to recast him as a No10. It was a role he performed with intuitive understanding, forever finding room between Burnley’s two banks of four. “He can play anywhere,” said his manager. “He can give a lot of aspects: technically, tactically and physically. His link-up play was exceptional and he brings a real know-how. There are few people who can teach things like Samuel due to his experience.”\n\nHis opener illustrated Eto’o’s elusiveness. He began the move in the centre circle and materialised, some 40 yards further forward and several seconds later, in the Burnley box with perfect timing. He met Leighton Baines’s cross with a header that crashed in off the underside of the bar. His second goal, sealing victory, was curled in from 25 yards with enviable expertise. The woodwork subsequently denied Eto’o a third goal after he anticipated Kieran Trippier’s misplaced backpass and shot from an acute angle. Coincidentally, given the fixture list, his last hat-trick came when Chelsea last met Manchester United.\n\nHe has added potency to this Everton side, for whom Steven Naismith also looped a header against the bar. Inevitably Eto’o was involved when Lukaku scored, sharing neat interplay with Naismith in a 24-pass move of patient probing. After the Belgian’s initial shot was blocked by Stephen Ward, he shovelled the rebound in. While there have been mumblings of discontent among supporters, Lukaku’s nine league games have already produced four goals. Such are the standards he has set that it almost feels underwhelming.\n\nHis other problem was that he had helped Burnley equalise. Nine minutes before his goal the Belgian had turned provider when a careless pass went to Lukas Jutkiewicz, who sent Danny Ings scurrying clear to elude Tim Howard and slide a shot into the unguarded net. It was not merely Ings’ first goal of the season but the first by any Burnley striker. It is a statistic that shows their problems.\n\nRedemption arrived swiftly for Lukaku. “Football is a game of errors and they will happen,” said Martínez. “I loved the reaction from Rom. He was unhappy because he gave the ball away and we got punished but, rather than accepting it, he did something about it. It was incredible to see that reaction.”\n\nDyche focused less on the emotion than the figures. “Lukaku is £28m,” he said. For Burnley, whose transfer outlay in their 132-year history stands at less than £50m, Lukaku’s strike was a reminder of how profoundly unfair the Premier League seems. Even if their tormentor-in-chief Eto’o arrived on a free transfer, his wages would not fit inside the Burnley budget.\n\nBecause of him Burnley, who have been ahead for only three minutes all season, were behind within four. If points were awarded for industry, they would not be in such difficulties. Instead they remain the only club in all the four divisions without a victory. “We have got to try and find a way to win,” said Dyche, before alighting on a reason for optimism. “It is an easy one

Trailing to Emmanuel Adebayor’s first-half goal, he introduced Sammy Ameobi and Rémy Cabella at half-time and watched them ignite a remarkable turnaround.\n\nAmeobi took what felt like a heartbeat to make his mark, fastening on to Jack Colback’s long ball to shoot beyond Hugo Lloris – the equaliser was timed at six seconds into the second half – whereas Cabella took a positively leisurely 13 minutes before his cross teed up Ayoze Pérez for what proved the winner.\n\nIt was a day of firsts for Newcastle: this was Pérez’s full Premier League debut and the 21-year-old, who signed from Tenerife in the summer, could toast his first goal in the club’s colours. For the 22-year-old Ameobi it was a first Premier League goal and for Pardew and Newcastle it was a first away win of the league season.\n\nNewcastle are hardly famed for their away form. Previously in this calendar year, they had won two of 14 league matches on the road and failed to score in nine. But it was an occasion in which everything came together for them in the second half and they could build on the home victory over Leicester City from the previous weekend.\n\nMike Ashley, the club’s owner, could beam from ear to ear and applaud the players off in enthusiastic fashion at the end. The last time he drew attention in London he had told a journalist outside the Golden Lion pub in Soho that Pardew would be sacked if Newcastle lost at Stoke City on 29 September. Pardew did lose but he remains alive.\n\nTottenham Hotspur were booed off, which tends to happen in these parts when the result is bad but the frustration was understandable. They had failed to build on Adebayor’s goal and the initial promise of Érik Lamela and Ryan Mason, and everything seemed to desert them in the second half.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Alan Pardew relieved after 2-1 win over Tottenham Hotspur – link to video\n\nMauricio Pochettino, the manager, said that the first half represented the “best 45 minutes” of his tenure at the club, which seemed a bit strong given the shortage of end product. But he was left to address familiar questions about the team’s mentality and concentration – principally, how on earth could they allow one long ball on the second-half restart to leave Ameobi one-on-one with Lloris?\n\nThe concession affected them badly and, when Pérez scored Newcastle’s second, the game looked like slipping beyond them. Pochettino was lost for an explanation. To him it was mystifying.\n\nNewcastle had lost the striker Papiss Cissé two hours before kick-off, as he felt a reaction in his knee to Saturday’s training session. So Pardew promoted Pérez and the visitors were fortunate to trail by only one at half-time. Adebayor scored it when his header from Mason’s cross punished slack Newcastle marking – it was only his second goal of the season – and Pochettino could reflect on some nice combinations from his players, even if there was the lack of incision.\n\nNewcastle offered very little in the first half – Pardew noted that they barely made a forward pass – but they bolted from the blocks in startling fashion after the interval. Pardew had sent his players out early and they went through a warm-up drill before their Tottenham counterparts had returned to the field.\n\nPochettino’s players were caught stone cold, nobody more so than the right-back, Eric Dier. Colback’s ball inside him ushered Ameobi through the inside-left channel and his low finish arrowed into the far corner. Pochettino was still in the tunnel when the ball hit the net.\n\nThe travelling Newcastle fans, after the season they have had, might have been forgiven for pinching themselves but things got even better for them when Pérez enjoyed his moment. The impressive Moussa Sissoko surged up the left and when he tapped the ball to Cabella there was the suspicion of offside. But there was no flag and Pérez stretched to meet Cabella’s cross with an excellent glancing header.\n\nPochettino took off his coat and placed it to one side. The afternoon was getting hot for him and Tottenham. Christian Eriksen had gone close before Pérez’s goal but it was Newcastle who might have extended their lead when Cabella wriggled free on the byline but opted to shoot rather than cut back and the ball swelled the side of the net.\n\nTottenham knew it was not to be their day when Eriksen’s outswinging corner was bundled into his own net by the goalkeeper, Tim Krul, but the assistant referee correctly spotted that the ball had curled out before it came back in. The Tottenham substitute Harry Kane drew a save out of Krul but his team departed with a whimper.\n\nMan of the match Moussa Sissoko (Newcastle United)"}, {"date": "26/10/2014", "arena": "Old Trafford", "attendance": 75327, "home_team": {"name": "Manchester United", "lineup": [{"name": "David De Gea", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rafael", "yellows": [12], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Smalling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marcos Rojo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Luke Shaw", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daley Blind", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ángel di María", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Juan Mata", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [67]}, {"name": "Marouane Fellaini", "yellows": [77], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adnan Januzaj", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robin van Persie", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [90], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Anders Lindegaard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Carrick", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ander Herrera", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Darren Fletcher", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tyler Blackett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andreas Pereira", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Wilson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [67], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Chelsea", "lineup": [{"name": "Thibaut Courtois", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Branislav Ivanovic", "yellows": [65], "reds": [90], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gary Cahill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Terry", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Filipe Luis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cesc Fàbregas", "yellows": [50], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nemanja Matic", "yellows": [39], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willian", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Oscar", "yellows": [62], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [67]}, {"name": "Eden Hazard", "yellows": [88], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Didier Drogba", "yellows": [22], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [53], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Petr Cech", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kurt Zouma", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathan Aké", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Mikel Obi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [67], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "André Schürrle", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mohamed Salah", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lewis Baker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Now, perhaps, Louis van Gaal has a better understanding of why Sir Alex Ferguson used to boast no other side on the planet had Manchester United’s penchant for late drama. They were in the fourth minute of stoppage time when Robin van Persie pulled back his left foot to rescue them and here was another moment to punish anyone who risks heading for the exits when United are chasing a game and the clock is still ticking.\n\nGeorge Best tried it as the 1999 Champions League final moved into extra time, with the score at 1-0 to Bayern Munich. Their latest feat of escapology ranks further down the “football, bloody hell” scale but it was still some moment and the celebration from Van Persie told its own story. He was off, running to the crowd, peeling off his shirt, throwing it high and screaming to the skies. It felt like an explosion of pent-up emotion and that small moment revealed a lot, perhaps, about this club’s inner frustrations.\n\nUntil then, it had been straying dangerously close to becoming another ordeal. They had been losing since the 53rd minute, courtesy of Didier Drogba’s first Premier League goal since March 2012, and unlike so many other United comebacks there had been no real sense this one was brewing. Chelsea were not completely coasting but United’s response to going behind had been poor and the league leaders were on the verge of moving six points clear of Southampton and eight from Manchester City. United were looking desperately short of ideas. In Van Gaal’s words: “We lost our heads.”\n\nOut of that, they should be mightily relieved about what followed. Everything started to unravel for Chelsea once Branislav Ivanovic fouled Ángel di María on the left wing and was sent off for his second booking.\n\nIvanovic’s first was on the same player but it scarcely warranted a yellow card and his sense of injustice will be compounded by the fact the referee, Phil Dowd, really should have awarded a penalty in his favour earlier in the match. As Ivanovic seethed in the tunnel, Di Maria whipped in the free-kick. Marouane Fellaini’s header was brilliantly saved by Thibaut Courtois but the rebound fell for Van Persie and he was on it in a flash. The power in his shot made it unstoppable.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Louis van Gaal: Manchester United not at best against Chelsea – link to video\n\nVan Gaal was notably unenthused about his team’s performance, bemused to hear them being praised on television, and revealing that he had scolded his players because “normally you have to play your best against the best teams”. He was also unimpressed with Van Persie’s celebration, describing it as “stupid” because it had invited Dowd to show his yellow card again.\n\nThere was, however, something to admire about United’s perseverance and, though Chelsea had controlled large swathes of the game, the statistics backed up Van Gaal’s point that the home side had created more scoring opportunities. There was encouragement in the form of Luke Shaw and some nice flashes from another 19-year-old, Adnan Januzaj, higher up their left side. Van Persie looked sharper than he has done for a while and Di María never stopped wanting the ball even on a day when he flickered only sporadically.\n\nEqually, there were sustained periods when Chelsea showed they are by far the more rounded team. Diego Costa had not recovered from his hamstring problems but Eden Hazard was superb on the left and it was his link-up with Drogba, culminating in a brilliant save from David de Gea, that led to the corner for their goal.\n\nFellaini’s close attentions meant Cesc Fàbregas could not exert his usual influence but Nemanja Matic was the driving force in midfield, quick to the ball, strong in the tackle, and one of the reasons, undoubtedly, why Van Gaal commented afterwards that United always seem to be smaller than their opponents.\n\nThat disparity cost United for Drogba’s goal and it was certainly a peculiar tactic that the man deployed with marking Chelsea’s scorer was their smallest defender, Rafael da Silva, giving away 16 centimetres in height. Until that point, Van Gaal’s team had shown a greater understanding of defence than has been seen at other times this season. Yet this was inexplicable. Van Persie could not keep out the ball on the goalline and Drogba, 37 on his next birthday, was running to the Chelsea fans for one of those look‑at‑me knee-slides that seemed to have been consigned to the past.\n\nSeven of the game’s 10 bookings went to Chelsea, meaning the club will automatically be fined, but Mourinho’s real grievance went back to that moment late in the first half when another corner went into United’s penalty area and Marcos Rojo bundled John Terry to the floor while Chris Smalling was guilty of an even more blatant piece of illegal grappling on Ivanovic. Referees have been encouraged to penalise these type of offences and Chelsea were entitled to feel hard done by.\n\nMaybe the home side might have done more to trouble Chelsea’s defence if Radamel Falcao had not suffered a training-ground injury and Wayne Rooney were not suspended. Yet Van Gaal’s reaction confirmed their imperfections are still widespread. The strange thing is that the late onslaught that might have been expected never really materialised. It was more a case of one free-kick, in a dangerous area, and a touch of fortune that when Fellaini’s header came back off Courtois it landed exactly where Van Persie wanted it.\n\nMan of the match Eden Hazard (Chelsea)"}, {"date": "25/10/2014", "arena": "Upton Park", "attendance": 34977, "home_team": {"name": "West Ham United", "lineup": [{"name": "Adrián", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Carl Jenkinson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Collins", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Winston Reid", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Cresswell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex Song", "yellows": [47], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mark Noble", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Morgan Amalfitano", "yellows": [7], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [21], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [67]}, {"name": "Stewart Downing", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Diafra Sakho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [75], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [89]}, {"name": "Enner Valencia", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [76]}], "subs": [{"name": "Kevin Nolan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [89], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cheikhou Kouyaté", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [67], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ricardo Vaz Te", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joey O'Brien", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jussi Jaaskelainen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Diego Poyet", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Carlton Cole", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [76], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Manchester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Joe Hart", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pablo Zabaleta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Vincent Kompany", "yellows": [44], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eliaquim Mangala", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gael Clichy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [78]}, {"name": "Jesus Navas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yaya Touré", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fernando", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [78]}, {"name": "David Silva", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [77], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Edin Dzeko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [59]}, {"name": "Sergio Agüero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Bacary Sagna", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Milner", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [78], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aleksandar Kolarov", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [78], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willy Caballero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fernandinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martín Demichelis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stevan Jovetic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [59], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Behold the new West Ham. Last season Sam Allardyce’s side were beaten four times by Manchester City, shipping 14 goals in the process, but here the revamped east Londoners outgunned the Premier League champions in a thrilling early afternoon showdown. In doing so they confirmed their emergence as entertainers and surprise candidates for an enduring place in the top four.\n\nBack in the summer, when the sun never set on the grumbling of West Ham fans about the their team’s bleak play under Allardyce, few would have foreseen such a scenario. But crafty recruitment has helped Allardyce fulfil his promise to deliver a more flamboyant style and all of the recent acquisitions made important contributions here, while stalwarts such as James Collins and goalkeeper Adrián excelled to deny City an equaliser as the champions raised their game in the second half.\n\nThe former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson, sticking up for his old chum Allardyce, had wondered aloud last week whether such a thing as the “West Ham Way” really existed: this display laid down a template that many teams would love to claim as their own.\n\n“It had grit, determination, quality, desire and everything you could want, including one or two flashy moments,” chirped Allardyce.\n\nThere was little sign of a shift in power in the early exchanges, as City created a series of good opportunities. Sergio Agüero let fly with a 25-yard shot that Adrián pushed behind for a corner in the second minute. David Silva then went close with a free-kick from similar range. Two minutes later Silva crossed in a free-kick on the right to Vincent Kompany, who nodded over from eight yards.\n\nBut West Ham gradually took control. Joe Hart had to make a block from Enner Valencia after Diafra Sakho flicked on a long free-kick. Posing problems from set-pieces is no novelty for an Allardyce team but West Ham soon served up a delicious example of the incisive new style that they have developed this season. In the 21st minute Alex Song split the City defence with an inspired low pass into the path of Valencia, who sprinted past Gaël Clichy and pulled the ball back for Morgan Amalfitano, who slotted into the net from close range.\n\nWith the hosts infused with fresh vibrancy, the whole midfield was dancing to Song’s tune. “Quality players look forward to the big games when the players of lesser quality get a bit anxious and think: ’Oh look who I’m playing against today’,” said Allardyce. “Songy’s led us as a team and the rest of the lads have responded to that. His promoting and passing and also his protection of the back players are excellent.”\n\nCity became disjointed, just as they had done when throwing away a two-goal lead against CSKA Moscow in midweek. Valencia should have given West Ham a bigger half-time lead but failed to connect properly with a shot from eight yards just before the break. Moments later an inventive set-piece move presented Allardyce’s side with another chance but Collins could not apply a decisive touch.\n\nCity came back to life in the dying seconds of the half and almost nicked an equaliser, only for Adrián to make a fine save from Agüero from close range. Manuel Pellegrini had to use the break to stimulate improvement from his team but decided not to make any personnel changes. The course of the game was not immediately altered either, as West Ham nearly scored with a flourish again in the 53rd minute, Stewart Downing flashing a shot just wide after a Song teed him up with a dinky rabona.\n\nPellegrini finally made a substitution in 59th minute, with Stevan Jovetic replacing Edin Dzeko. Agüero nearly brought the visitors level moments later, but after a typical scurry into the penalty area the Argentinian was foiled, first by another smart save from Adrián, then by a block from Collins.\n\nAs City slipped into a menacing groove and Yaya Touré awoke, Agüero went even closer, slamming the ball against the cross bar from six yards before his shot on the rebound was saved by Adrián.\n\nWest Ham had to demonstrate their defensive qualities but still put City in trouble on the counterattack. The match was developing into a minor classic. A sweeping move by the home team in the 71st minute could have culminated in a splendid goal but Sakho’s shot just cleared the bar. That was followed by another intricate City move, which Touré tried to crown with a goal but his curling shot struck the crossbar. Ah, that fine margin between success and failure.\n\nWest Ham found themselves on the right side in the 75th minute, when Aaron Cresswell raced down the left and crossed for Sakho, whose header was clawed out by Hart - but from a couple of inches behind the line.\n\nWest Ham had barely finished celebrating that when Silva cut their lead back to one goal, skittering into the box before placing a lovely curler into the bottom corner. Pellegrini thrust on James Milner and Aleksandar Kolarov as he sought to salvage at least a point, but West Ham did not buckle."}, {"date": "25/10/2014", "arena": "Anfield", "attendance": 44591, "home_team": {"name": "Liverpool", "lineup": [{"name": "Simon Mignolet", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Javi Manquillo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Skrtel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dejan Lovren", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alberto Moreno", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Allen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [61]}, {"name": "Steven Gerrard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Emre Can", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [75]}, {"name": "Raheem Sterling", "yellows": [55], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mario Balotelli", "yellows": [57], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Lallana", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [61]}], "subs": [{"name": "Brad Jones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Glen Johnson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kolo Touré", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rickie Lambert", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [61], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Philippe Coutinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [61], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordan Henderson", "yellows": [81], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [75], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lazar Markovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Hull City", "lineup": [{"name": "Eldin Jakupovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Chester", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex Bruce", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Curtis Davies", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ahmed Elmohamady", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jake Livermore", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mohamed Diamé", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [86]}, {"name": "Tom Huddlestone", "yellows": [40], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robbie Brady", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Hatem Ben Arfa", "yellows": [50], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [71]}, {"name": "Abel Hernandez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [71]}], "subs": [{"name": "Rory Watson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Liam Rosenior", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Meyler", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [86], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paul McShane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sone Aluko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [71], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gaston Ramirez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [71], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stephen Quinn", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Mario Balotelli went from whipping boy to Liverpool’s most effective player in the space of four days. That was Steve Bruce’s opinion, at any rate. Unfortunately standing out in a performance like this does not count for a great deal. Philippe Coutinho was arguably more effective in the half-hour he was granted, and Balotelli is still looking for his first league goal for Liverpool in spite of a couple of presentable late chances.\n\nThe Italian starting the game was a mild surprise, and it is true he accomplished more of note in the first 45 minutes than he managed in his half a game against Real Madrid in midweek, though Hull City’s defence are not quite of the standard of the European champions’. Balotelli brought a good save from Eldin Jakupovic after 12 minutes, sent Alberto Moreno galloping down the left wing with an elegant backheel a little later, and even passed to colleagues on occasions instead of shooting every time he received the ball.\n\nThe first half was still a dreary non-event, proof not even Balotelli’s presence can guarantee an eventful game. “Just like a library,” the Hull fans chanted midway through the first half, correctly observing Anfield’s famous atmosphere had all but evaporated. Apart from the Kop making unkind remarks about the size of Steve Bruce’s head, which the Hull manager took in good spirit, Liverpool produced almost nothing before the interval. Dejan Lovren saw an early header from a corner saved, Balotelli tested Jakupovic’s reactions again, and that was about it. By half-time the home crowd was practically falling asleep.\n\nThe visitors were only slightly less soporific, although of course holding your own at Anfield and silencing a Liverpool crowd can both be regarded as achievements in themselves. Hull had a commanding attacking presence in Mohamed Diamé, who seemed to make the right side of Liverpool’s defence melt away every time he made a muscular run down the left. Their most likely source of inspiration was the enigmatic Hatem ben Arfa, who gets called enigmatic because he brings his delightful touch and vision to bear roughly two or three times on any given Saturday afternoon. Here, he made a thrilling run after three minutes then disappeared for the next half-hour, rematerialising just before the break to slip effortlessly behind the defence and create a shooting chance for Jake Livermore that the midfielder put too close to Simon Mignolet. Half-time came just as Hull were showing a little adventure, or at least putting a few tidy attacks together. Liverpool, with Raheem Sterling isolated on the right and Balotelli mostly a spectator in the middle, were increasingly relying on set pieces and corners.\n\nSteven Gerrard drilled a couple of low shots narrowly wide early in the second half, but Liverpool improved as soon as Brendan Rodgers sent on Coutinho and Rickie Lambert for the last half hour. A Coutinho corner, headed on by Emre Can, almost brought a first league goal for Balotelli but the striker was unable to force the ball over the line from close range. Then Lambert sent Sterling away down the right for a cross Balotelli might have converted had he not taken his eye off the ball to foul a defender.\n\nSuddenly Anfield was a noisy place again, Hull were being trapped in their own half for long periods, and the contest had become a question of how long the visitors could hang on. As it happened the answer was 90 minutes. For all their pressure in the second half Liverpool never managed a shot on target until stoppage time, when Sterling, Coutinho and Balotelli came up with three in quick succession, all stopped by Jakupovic.\n\nThings might have been different had Lovren come up with more than an air shot on the six-yard line after Balotelli had teed him up, or had Lambert shown a better first touch when neatly played clear by Coutinho, but as the Hull goalkeeper was only busy for the added four minutes it was hard to argue the visitors did not deserve their point.\n\nBalotelli was involved in a late penalty appeal against Alex Bruce, but even Rodgers accepted his player was falling over anyway, concealing his disappointment that a stronger finisher would have stayed on his feet and put away the chance.\n\nMore frustration for Liverpool, for Hull another impressive point at a difficult ground."}, {"date": "25/10/2014", "arena": " Mary's Stadium", "attendance": 30017, "home_team": {"name":

exhibition of attacking football from Ronald Koeman’s side and another 8-0 victory, only to leave disappointed after 90 tone-deaf minutes. The identity of the opposition contributed to those fears. Stoke City seemed perfectly suited to playing the role of spoilsports. All that hope, all that expectation – it was all set up for a scrappy 1-0 win to Stoke thanks to a header from Marc Wilson. It sure is a funny old game.\n\nYou know what they say about good sides, though: they find a way to win when they are not at their best and while Southampton occasionally threatened to scale the heights of last Saturday’s humiliation of Sunderland, this latest victory owed as much to their organisation off the ball as it did to their ability on it.\n\n“It is not easy to play against Southampton,” Koeman said. Indeed, this is a multi-layered team: their attack is a thing of beauty when it clicks, as Stoke discovered in the first half, but they also have the best defensive record in the league. It is why Sadio Mané’s goal in the first half was enough to lift Southampton up to second, two points above Manchester City, three behind Chelsea.\n\nHow uplifting to see Southampton, so unfancied back in the summer, mixing it with the big boys. They play with the infectious arrogance that makes you wish them well and it was not long before they were attacking with their usual blend of energy, inventiveness and quick thinking. The first chance came in the fourth minute, Mané cutting in from the left and rapping in a low cross-shot that Graziano Pellè, sliding in at the far post, could not convert.\n\nStoke then posed some questions of their own. They may possess earthier qualities than Southampton but they have some neat footballers and flickered on the break. Peter Crouch fluffed a header from a Steven N’Zonzi cross before Victor Moses went close to scoring one of the solo goals of the season. But his finish at the end of a sashaying run was tame.\n\nBack came Southampton. Pellè fired over from another Mané ball, Dusan Tadic forced Asmir Begovic to tip wide at his near post and Morgan Schneiderlin crashed an effort against the bar after a clever set-piece routine.\n\nStoke cracked in the 33rd minute. They failed to clear a free-kick and Pellè chested the ball down before firing against the right post. The Southampton fans howled in frustration again, wondering if the ball would ever go in – but Stoke were not out of the woods yet. The rebound fell to Mané and his emphatic finish flew high into the left corner. Apparently this counted as Mané’s first Southampton goal, his strike against Sunderland having been taken off him for reasons that remain unclear. Perhaps we need a Dubious Dubious Goals Panel.\n\nSouthampton had their release and they almost doubled their lead shortly after half-time when Pellè headed against the bar. In response, Mark Hughes introduced Marko Arnautovic, Oussama Assaidi and Mame Biram Diouf in an attempt to inject more urgency into Stoke’s attack and suddenly you sensed that Southampton needed the cushion of a second goal.\n\n“It was difficult because we didn’t kill the game,” Koeman said. “We created eight good chances. We know if you didn’t score the second one it is difficult.”\n\nYet Stoke, unable to stretch Fraser Forster, were flat and their threat had fizzled out long before the final whistle. Diouf almost reached a cross at the far post near the end but that was it. “We’re a little bit disappointed,” Hughes said.\n\nYou cannot win 8-0 every week but Southampton deserved the points."},

described his side as warming up nicely but still striving to reach “boiling point”. In other words Arsenal’s class of 2014-15 are big on promise but not yet quite as formidable as they probably should be.\n\nThere were rare moments when his players threatened to drop a point here but, for the most part, Sunderland made things reasonably straightforward as the excellent Alexis Sánchez scored twice and the latest bout of perceived pressure surrounding Arsenal’s manager eased.\n\nFor the moment at least that unwanted baton has been passed to Gus Poyet. If a home draw with Hull spelt bad news for Wenger last week, an 8-0 surrender at Southampton has placed Sunderland’s manager in an unwanted spotlight. If this latest defeat was nothing like as humiliating, Sunderland made two appalling errors and, despite much commendable commitment, looked worryingly vulnerable at times. Poyet’s team have won once in the Premier League this season and it threatens to be a long winter on Wearside.\n\n“After such a big defeat Sunderland were focused on defending very well,” said a smiling Wenger. “But we were in control.”\n\nPoyet did his best to hide his frustration. “Compared to last week the organisation was there but we made two bad mistakes,” he said. “I don’t know if it was tension. There’s a little bit of anger in the dressing room because the players fought really hard.”\n\nIf the fact that Wenger was missing eight regular first-team players will not have been lost on his rather more thinly-staffed counterpart, Sunderland fans certainly turned wistful at the sight of Danny Welbeck, a former loanee here, offering Arsenal extra directness and dynamism. This turned out to be far from his best game but, even so, Welbeck swiftly reminded locals precisely what they are missing when, cued up by Sánchez and Santi Cazorla, he unleashed a curling, dipping shot that flew fractionally over Vito Mannone’s bar.\n\nUnderstandably on edge following his experience at St Mary’s, Mannone’s nerves subsequently showed when he spilled a routine cross before being rescued by John O’Shea’s interception. By then Arsenal were controlling the tempo, slowing things right down when it suited them and reducing Poyet to a restless, twitchy figure constantly running through the full gamut of animated grimaces as he prowled the touchline.\n\nThe Uruguayan’s fears were realised on the half-hour mark. For some reason Wes Brown opted to unleash an ill-advised back-pass from a long way out. Even worse he totally miscued it and watched appalled as the ball dropped into Sánchez’s path.\n\nA brilliant goal was seconds away. Left one-on-one against the advancing Mannone, Sánchez beat the former Arsenal goalkeeper courtesy of a delicate, beautifully weighted right-footed dink. “Sanchez has super quality,” Wenger said. “He took advantage of their mistakes.”\n\nOn a day when Cazorla missed two presentable chances, Sunderland were always second best but rallied creditably with Wojciech Szczesny reacting smartly to keep out Jack Rodwell’s header early in the second half.\n\nShortly afterwards Rodwell was caught on the chin by Mikel Arteta’s boot. Although clearly unintentional, it still constituted dangerous play and, with the home fans demanding his dismissal, he was shown a yellow card. It was not the only high boot or reckless challenge as, with Arsenal clearly becoming anxious about their failure to score a second goal and Sunderland upping their game, tackles flew in and tempers rose.\n\nInjuries to Steven Fletcher and Kieran Gibbs weakened both sides but, despite Gibbs’s departure, Arsenal finished the stronger. Welbeck might have compensated for a largely disappointing 90 minutes – (although he was harshly booked for diving) – by heading Nacho Monreal’s inviting cross home but instead directed the ball narrowly over the bar.\n\nWatching as a substitute for the first time since his knee operation in January Theo Walcott must have been hoping for a summons from Wenger but instead remained on the bench as Sánchez stroked his second goal home from six yards in stoppage time.\n\nDelighted as Arsenal’s manager undoubtedly was to see his star summer signing stroke a simple chance into the empty net, Wenger expressed “sympathy” for his old goalkeeper. Caught in possession after being played into trouble, the horrified Italian saw the ball bobble off his boot and roll towards Sánchez’s feet.\n\nAs Mannone trudged off looking close to tears, Costel Pantilimon, his understudy, would hardly have been human had he not sensed an opportunity looming."}, {"date": "25/10/2014", "arena": "The Hawthorns", "attendance": 24738, "home_team": {"name": "West

Julián Speroni. The goalkeeper was taken out by Dawson when Victor Anichebe scored to ignite an Albion recovery as they fought back to claim a draw. Saido Berahino’s injury-time penalty completed the comeback after Palace eased into a 2-0 lead.\n\nBrede Hangeland and Mile Jedinak’s penalty had put Palace in control but Warnock was furious with Dawson, comparing the incident to Peter Murphy’s challenge on Bert Trautmann in the 1956 FA Cup final. That left the Manchester City goalkeeper with dislocations to five vertebrae in his neck and meant he missed a large part of the 1956-57 season.\n\nWarnock said: “It’s almost an assault, how one of the four officials can’t be in a position to see that. Dawson had smashed him in the face and I am lost for words. He’s had a two- or three-yard run-up and smashed him in the face. No wonder Julián is a bit groggy. He wanted to carry on.\n\n“I’ve had enough talking to the FA. I have not seen something like that since Bert Trautmann. I can’t say anything about the referee or I get fined and I don’t want to because I thought he had a cracking game but he had made two or three really bad mistakes.”\n\nMark Clattenburg also failed to give Palace a penalty before Jedinak’s spot-kick when Wilfried Zaha looked to have been fouled by Dawson. Warnock said: “You can’t win, we had four or five surrounding the referee last week and we were told that was wrong. He had a good game but two, maybe three, decisions went against us and it’s cost us.”\n\nThe Palace manager insisted he knew little of the claims a billionaire American investor Josh Harris was in talks to buy the club. He said: “I only know what I have read. I will be speaking to the chairman but you have to ask him.”\n\nAlan Irvine admitted he had to get angry with his side after their first-half no show. The West Brom head coach said: “They did see another side to me, one which doesn’t come out very often but has to come out from time to time.\n\n“I was bitterly disappointed with the first 32 minutes of the game. We conceded the penalty on a counterattack but for the first 32 minutes we were awful. After that we did what we were supposed to be doing and we eventually got a reward.”\n\nAnichebe scored his first goal of the season after recovering from a groin injury and Irvine felt he played a major part. He said: “There’s no doubt Victor made a difference and before the game I thought we might need him. Having watched Palace and looked at their strengths and the way they are able to play I felt Victor would be needed at some point.”PA"}, {"date": "25/10/2014", "arena": "The Liberty Stadium", "attendance": 20259, "home_team": {"name": "Swansea City", "lineup": [{"name": "Lukasz Fabianski", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Angel Rangel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Federico Fernandez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Williams", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Neil Taylor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sung-Yueng Ki", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonjo Shelvey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wayne Routledge", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [83]}, {"name": "Gylfi Sigurdsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [58]}, {"name": "Jefferson Montero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wilfried Bony", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [34, 57], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [83]}], "subs": [{"name": "Marvin Emnes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathan Dyer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [83], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Carroll", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [58], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bafétimbi Gomis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [83], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gerhard Tremmel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Bartley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Liam Shephard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Leicester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Kasper Schmeichel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ritchie de Laet", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wes Morgan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Liam Moore", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paul Konchesky", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dean Hammond", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [68]}, {"name": "Danny Drinkwater", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [68]}, {"name": "Riyad Mahrez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Nugent", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jamie Vardy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [67]}, {"name": "Leonardo Ulloa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Matthew James", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [67], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andy King", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [68], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jeffrey Schlupp", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Esteban Cambiasso", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [68], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marcin Wasilewski", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Smith", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Wood", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Swansea City ensured their winless run ended at five games as Wilfried Bony’s double restored smiles to the faces of those at the Welsh club after a testing week. Bony finished off excellent build-ups for both goals, exchanging passes with Gylfi Sigurdsson for the first, while Jefferson Montero teed up his second as Swansea climbed to sixth in the table.\n\nLeicester City are now four games without a win themselves and Nigel Pearson will know his side need to find a cutting edge after failing to have an effort on goal during the opening half, and rarely threatening thereafter.\n\nIt has been the most difficult week of the Garry Monk’s fledgling managerial career after the furore caused by his strong comments directed at the Stoke winger Victor Moses and the referee Michael Oliver. The Swansea manager was glad to enjoy a quieter day’s work. He said: “I suppose you guys may see it as a bit boring after the week we have had, but I am fine with that.\n\n“We were under a bit of pressure to perform but we scored two well-worked goals, we were clinical which perhaps we have been lacking in the last few weeks. It was good for Wilfried, he has been playing well and all strikers get a good momentum from scoring.”\n\nThe 35-year-old Monk had insisted the continuing debate over the rights and wrongs of the Moses incident would not impact upon Swansea’s performance. He was largely proved right as, despite never being particularly fluent, his side dominated.\n\nThere were few clearcut chances, and arguably the best opportunity of the opening half-hour came from a Leicester error. Kasper Schmeichel’s scuffed pass fell straight to Sigurdsson but the Iceland international hesitated and Wes Morgan made a crucial intervention.\n\nThere was no such reprieve in the 34th minute. Bony’s delicious backheel sent Sigurdsson scampering into space where he returned the ball to the Ivorian, who shot beyond Schmeichel for his third goal in three games.\n\nHaving taken the lead, Swansea were guilty of losing their focus as Liam Moore’s long throw came through a crowd of players and bounced up on to the top of the bar. But, just as Leicester started to threaten, Swansea doubled their lead. Sigurdsson’s pass cut Ritchie De Laet out and sent Montero in behind the defence to lay on a simple finish for Bony.\n\nJonjo Shelvey almost made it three a few minutes later, hitting the bar with a dipping, swerving strike from 30 yards. It prompted a triple change from Pearson as Esteban Cambiasso, Andy King and Matty James were all thrown on. But it was too little, too late for the east Midlands side as Swansea eased to a much-needed win, with Cambiasso hitting the post from three yards after Lukasz Fabianski had saved King’s header.\n\nPearson was disappointed with his side’s performance, and played down Leicester’s request to have the Liberty Stadium goalposts measured before the game, as their goalkeepers felt they were too high. He said: “I thought it was in everyone’s best interests. The officials were slightly surprised but everyone was fine. I could have done with them being a bit smaller.”"}, {"date": "20/10/2014", "arena": "The Hawthorns", "attendance": 25794, "home_team": {"name": "West Bromwich Albion", "lineup": [{"name": "Boaz

"There was a touch of the old Manchester United about their ability to score late on and salvage something from a thrilling game that had looked to be slipping through their fingers, yet it was hard to escape the feeling that this was another unsatisfactory evening for Louis van Gaal and his players.\n\nUnited provided evidence of their powers of recovery by twice coming from behind to peg back a courageous Albion team but, once again, it was impossible to ignore their weaknesses in defence. The broader picture shows that they have only one point more on the board than they did at the same stage last season, by which point David Moyes had come up against Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester City.\n\nVan Gaal, in contrast, could hardly have wished for a more benign start to the season. The serious business is about to begin. United face Chelsea, Manchester City and Arsenal in three of their next four games and there will need to be a major improvement in their defending if they are to come through that run unscathed.\n\nVan Gaal has yet to win away from home – for the first time in 18 years United have gone six Premier League games without a victory on their travels – and with all due respect to their opponents on the road so far, MK Dons, Burnley, Sunderland, Leicester and West Bromwich Albion, they are not exactly world-beaters.\n\nThe bottom line is that United look vulnerable at the back and until Van Gaal addresses their shortcomings in that department teams such as West Bromwich will fancy their chances. The opening goal was a case in point, as Albion exploited the space that opened up behind Luke Shaw and took the lead through a wonderful goal from Stéphane Sessègnon. As for Albion’s second goal, Rafael da Silva played Saido Berahino onside and the Albion striker strengthened his case for a full England call-up with a composed finish that took his tally for the season to an impressive seven.\n\nIn between those two fine Albion goals, Marouane Fellaini opened his United account with another goal of the highest quality. On for Ander Herrera at the interval, the Belgian made an impact within three minutes when he thundered an unstoppable shot inside Boaz Myhill’s near post and into the top corner. Long overdue – this was Fellaini’s 24th appearance for United – but it was not a bad way to get off the mark. United were buoyant at that stage but Berahino’s breakaway goal turned the game on its head again.\n\nVan Gaal introduced Radamel Falcao, who had started on the bench because he was suffering from jet leg after returning from playing for Colombia in Canada on Friday, and United cranked up the pressure. A penalty appeal was turned down when Sébastien Pocognoli unwittingly handled, and Robin van Persie hit an upright before Daley Blind, with a beautifully placed shot from 20 yards, hauled United level.\n\nIt was no more than United deserved on the balance of play – they enjoyed 63% of possession and had 22 shots to Albion’s eight – but it was also easy to understand why Alan Irvine’s players looked so crestfallen at the final whistle. They were dangerous on the counter-attack, worked tirelessly, defended resolutely and had come agonisingly close to picking up a famous victory.\n\nThe evening could not have got off to a better start for the home team. There appeared little danger when Myhill, making a rare appearance after Ben Foster injured a calf in training, hurriedly cleared upfield, but Graham Dorrans, getting in front of Shaw, deliciously flicked the ball round the corner to release the marauding Andre Wisdom.\n\nWith Angel Di María caught upfield and Shaw now out of the game, Wisdom was free to break forward on the Albion right and slide a low centre perfectly into the path of Sessègnon, who did not break stride before sweeping a sumptuous first-time shot from the edge of the area into the top corner.\n\nUnited huffed and puffed for the remainder of the first half but the killer touch in front of goal was missing. Van Persie, set up by Di María’s lovely pass, shot straight at Myhill two minutes after Sessègnon’s goal and the Dutchman went close again later in the half, when he picked Joleon Lescott’s pocket and saw his shot blocked by Craig Dawson.\n\nVan Gaal made a change at the interval and was quickly rewarded. Di María’s floated cross from the right looked no more than hopeful but Fellaini, after nudging Lescott, took the ball down on his chest, shifted it out of his feet and thumped a rising 18-yard drive that flashed past Myhill and tore into the net.\n\nIt was clearly not what one of Albion’s media staff had in mind. “Fellaini has now taken his tracksuit off, fortunately he has a Man Utd strip underneath,” was the message posted on their official Twitter account moments before the Belgian came on for Herrera. An hour after the game it had been retweeted more than 17,000 times.\n\nUnited were starting to turn the screw but they contrived to concede a second when Berahino, running on to Chris Brunt’s threaded pass, sprinted clear and calmly beat David de Gea.\n\nFalcao replaced the ineffective Juan Mata and Ashley Young came on for Di María as United became increasingly desperate.

Leroy Fer and Wilfried Bony each launched rockets into the Loftus Road net for their teams as the points were shared in an incendiary Premier League match in which tempers occasionally exploded.\n\nThe Swansea City manager, Garry Monk, struggled to keep a lid on his fury, believing, with strong justification, that his team were on the wrong end of two critical decisions that could have altered the outcome of the contest. First the Queens Park Rangers goalkeeper, Rob Green, escaped unpunished after handling the ball outside his area in the sixth minute to prevent Wayne Routledge from running around him and then, in the closing minutes, Routledge was sent off after reacting angrily to a dangerous late tackle on him by Karl Henry. “There was no justice whatsoever in that decision, he didn’t kick out at all,” fumed Monk. “He’s gone from [receiving] a leg-breaker to being sent off. It doesn’t make sense.”\n\nMonk also professed to being “baffled” by the officials’ failure to spot Green’s offence and said he was “losing faith” in Premier League authorities given that these controversies came just a couple of days after Swansea’s Jonjo Shelvey was banned for raising his hands to a Liverpool player in a match in which Raheem Sterling committed a similar offence in front of the assistant referee but was not sanctioned because the officials said that they saw it but did not consider it serious.\n\n“The credibility of it is diminished,” said Monk, who confirmed he will ask for Routledge’s red card to be rescinded. “I don’t want to talk about these things but when you’re constantly battling these game-changing decisions you begin to lose faith.”\n\nThe QPR manager, Harry Redknapp, was also aggrieved, but not for the same reason. Instead he lamented his team’s concession of a stoppage-time equaliser. “We lost two vital points that we deserved and needed,” he said. Rangers are two points above the relegation zone and dropping points at home increases the pressure on them to improve their awful away record.\n\nFor a long time Rangers seemed on course for victory. They had begun sluggishly and could have been behind before the 20th minute, which is when Fer ran on to an attempted clearance by Federico Fernández and lashed a ferocious shot into the net from 25 yards. The goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski got a hand to it but could not stop it.\n\nSwansea had chances to draw level in the first half but Bafétimbi Gomis, whose overall play was neat, was guilty of three weak finishes. The Frenchman was given his fourth league start of the season in place of Bony, who started on the bench amid intense speculation linking him with a January transfer to Chelsea or Manchester City.\n\nMonk said there have been no offers yet for the Ivorian, who, he said, was left out purely because “we needed freshness” at the end of a busy festive period. Asked whether he expects Bony to return to Swansea after this month’s Africa Cup of Nations, Monk replied: “Of course. He will be a Swansea player until he isn’t.\n\n“After he came on [in the 71st minute] he showed his concentration and focus and respect for this club, so to say his mind is elsewhere is obviously wrong,” added Monk.\n\nAfter he came on Bony also showed why so many clubs covet him. He forced a fine save from Green from 20 yards shortly after his introduction and then, with Rangers sensing victory, he collected a pass from Ki Sung-yueng before creating space where there seemed to be none and firing a superb shot into the top corner from 16 yards. “When I came on the pitch I wanted to show [Monk] I should have started,” said Bony.\n\nThat goal came six minutes after Routledge’s 86th-minute dismissal but there was still time for Rangers to threaten an equaliser, Charlie Austin and Joey Barton having shots blocked in a chaotic goalmouth scramble.\n\nFer, Bobby Zamora and Eduardo Vargas had earlier gone close during a Rangers display that was far more vibrant than the one they had produced in Sunday’s dull draw with Crystal Palace. But ultimately their reward was the same and it remains to be seen whether two points from these two home games will be enough for a side that have yet to pick up a single Premier League point away.\n\nMan of the match Eduardo Vargas (QPR)"}, {"date": "19/10/2014", "arena": "Bet365 Stadium", "attendance": 27017, "home_team": {"name": "Stoke City", "lineup": [{"name": "Asmir Begovic",

Monk has launched a scathing attack in which he has accused Michael Oliver, the Premier League referee, of “cheating” Swansea City and claimed that Victor Moses was guilty of a dive that he “should be ashamed of” after the Stoke City winger was awarded a highly contentious first-half penalty.\n\nThe Swansea City manager also rounded on Mike Riley, the general manager of Professional Game Match Officials Limited, whom he accused of “poor leadership” after failing to make any contact with the Welsh club following a number of controversial refereeing decisions in recent weeks.\n\nMonk revealed that Swansea have now gone above Riley’s head and sent a letter of complaint, complete with DVD footage, to John Williams, the chairman of the PGMOL, highlighting perceived injustices. There is likely to be another in the post after this defeat. Monk, who was absolutely furious, described Oliver’s decision to point to the spot when Moses tumbled under minimal contact from Angel Rangel as “disgraceful” and “disgusting”.\n\nSwansea were 1-0 up at the time, after Oliver had given a more straightforward penalty at the other end, when Ryan Shawcross was penalised for wrestling Wilfried Bony to the ground. Bony duly converted from the spot and Charlie Adam did likewise for Stoke two minutes before the interval. Jonathan Walters then antagonised Swansea’s feelings further with a headed winner, from Oussama Assaidi’s cross, to condemn Monk’s team to a fifth league game without a win.\n\nMonk made no attempt to conceal his anger afterwards, in particular with the circumstances surrounding Stoke’s penalty. “It’s obviously a massive game-changing moment,” the Swansea manager said. “For me, it’s a disgusting decision. How he can’t see that’s a blatant dive is beyond me. Moses has cheated the ref, and then the ref’s cheated us in terms of giving a decision that never was. The player should be ashamed of himself. I wouldn’t be able to go home to my family and show my face.”\n\nFor Monk, it has become a familiar story this season, prompting Swansea to present a case to the PGMOL before this match. “The problem I have with it now is that in a lot of the games, match-changing decisions are going against us constantly, and I don’t see anything being done about it. I’ve spoken to the referees and the association about it, and I don’t hear anything coming back to me from Mike Riley at all which I find poor leadership. The whole thing is mounting up now, which is becoming a very worrying situation.\n\n“We’ve sent a letter to the chairman of [the PGMOL], Mr John Williams, with a DVD, just asking questions. We just want to know why the consistency isn’t there. We’ve shown some decisions [to PGMOL] against us, wanting to explain how that is a yellow card, and other big decisions which have changed games for us. We just want an explanation.”\n\nMonk’s outburst will almost certainly result in him facing a Football Association disciplinary charge – something that Mark Hughes alluded to after the game, when the Stoke manager said there are times when “you just have to be careful what you say because you can get yourself into trouble”.\n\nHughes argued with just about everything that Monk said, including the accusation levelled at Moses. “I don’t think he dived. I think he felt contact, I think he was running at pace between two defenders and the onus is on the defender not to go anywhere near him because if you put an arm across a player running at pace, then the likelihood is he’ll be knocked out of his stride and will go down,” he said. “It’s a soft one and you can argue about it as much as you like. He gave it and that’s the end of it.”\n\nAs for Oliver’s decision to penalise Shawcross earlier in the game, when the Stoke captain was grappling with Bony before Gylfi Sigurdsson’s corner kick had got anywhere near the pair of them, Hughes expressed concern that “people are trying to highlight Ryan, over most defenders, in terms of him being more adept at holding people in the box, which is pure nonsense”. In other news, Stoke moved up to 10th place.\n\nMan of the match Charlie Adam (Stoke)"}, {"date": "18/10/2014", "arena": "Etihad Stadium", "attendance": 45549, "home_team": {"name": "Manchester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Joe Hart", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bacary Sagna", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Vincent Kompany", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martín Demichelis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gael Clichy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fernando", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [76]}, {"name": "Frank Lampard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [28]}, {"name": "Jesus Navas", "yellows": [55], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Silva", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [70]}, {"name": "James Milner", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sergio Agüero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [13, 20, 68, 75], "missed_pens": [32], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Edin Dzeko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aleksandar Kolarov", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willy Caballero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fernandinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [28], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stevan Jovetic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [70], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dedryck Boyata", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yaya Touré", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [76], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Tottenham Hotspur", "lineup": [{"name": "Hugo Lloris", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eric Dier", "yellows": [37], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Younes Kaboul", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Federico Fazio", "yellows": [], "reds": [67], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Rose", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Etienne Capoue", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [60]}, {"name": "Ryan Mason", "yellows": [33], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [70]}, {"name": "Erik Lamela", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [60]}, {"name": "Christian Eriksen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [15], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nacer Chadli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Roberto Soldado", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [62], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Jan Vertonghen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [70], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Emmanuel Adebayor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michel Vorm", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andros Townsend", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [60], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Kane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mousa Dembélé", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [60], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Benjamin Stambouli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "When Mauricio Pochettino was asked before this match for his impressions of Sergio Agüero he compared it to the joys of listening to Mozart and Beethoven. Agüero’s performance here could certainly have been set to music but, for Pochettino, it must have sounded like the blare of sirens whenever the Manchester City striker had the ball. Or the theme from Jaws, considering the fear he put into the Tottenham defence.\n\nAgüero terrorised his opponents, scored four times, missed a penalty and, in the process, caught and overhauled his compatriot Carlos Tevez’s scoring record in City’s colours. Tevez managed 58 Premier League goals in 113 appearances. Agüero’s 61 have come in 95 games and it is difficult to remember the last time one of City’s players tormented the opposition so relentlessly and mercilessly. Manuel Pellegrini described him afterwards as “one of the best three or four strikers in the world”.\n\nBy the end, Younès Kaboul’s limitations had been brutally exposed and Federico Fazio, his partner in central defence, had become so flustered that he tugged down Agüero for a red card. Spurs, having conceded three of the game’s four penalties, looked like a side in need of smelling salts and that slightly haunted appearance has become a recurring theme in these fixtures. Over their past seven meetings there have been 35 goals – and City have accounted for 26 of them.\n\nThe paradox was that Tottenham could head back south reflecting that Joe Hart had also put in possibly his best performance on this ground since the Champions League tie against Borussia Dortmund two years ago. A striker will always get the accolades after a four-goal haul but Hart’s contribution was significant. It started early on when he jutted out a leg to prevent Ryan Mason opening the scoring and his portfolio of saves included one from the penalty spot when Roberto Soldado had the chance to make it 2-2 just after the hour. As Pochettino reflected, that was the key moment of a match filled with drama and incident.\n\nTottenham certainly carried a threat going forward but defensively they were poor in the extreme and fortunate, perhaps, that Hugo Lloris stopped the score being even more harrowing. Agüero’s first was a typical piece of excellence, taking a touch to elude Kaboul and then firing in a vicious, diagonal shot through a crowded penalty area. His next two came from penalties and the fourth was another classic moment of centre-forward play, turning inside the substitute Jan Vertonghen and delivering a beautifully weighted left-foot finish inside the far post.\n\nAgüero has now scored nine times in six games against Spurs and was so rampant here he might reflect he ought to have had more. Even ignoring the other occasions when he took aim at Lloris’s goal, his hat-trick could have been wrapped up inside 32 minutes after Kaboul’s careless challenge on David Silva. This time, Agüero’s penalty was struck poorly and when the rebound came back off Lloris he rushed his attempt at a bicycle kick and slashed the follow-up effort over the bar.\n\nFor a brief passage in the second half, it had looked as though that miss could have costly repercussions for City. Instead, Hart dived full-length to his right to keep out Soldado’s penalty and within five minutes Fazio was trudging off the pitch and Agüero was about to make it 3-1 with his third spot-kick. Pochettino had chosen a strange time to give Fazio, an £8m signing from Sevilla, his league debut and the 27-year-old Argentinian will remember it as an ordeal.\n\nReplays showed Soldado had been marginally outside the area when Martín Demichelis tripped him but, equally, the visitors were aggrieved with the first of City’s penalties, when Frank Lampard went down under the slightest of touches from the accident-prone Erik Lamela. The only absolute certainty was that Spurs were permanently vulnerable in defence and Agüero was not in the mood to be charitable.\n\nThe downside for City was that they, too, looked unusually susceptible at the back and Pellegrini was quite restrained when he said it “could easily have been 7-3”. They were indebted to Hart’s goalkeeping and Fernando made a bad mistake to lose the ball in the moments before Christian Eriksen lashed in to make it 1-1 a minute after Agüero’s goal.\n\nCity also lost Lampard in the first half because of a thigh injury that required him to leave the pitch on a stretcher. Yet they had put on another awesome demonstration of their firepower despite starting with Yaya Touré and Edin Dzeko on the bench. Jesús Navas had one of his better games and James Milner, who struck the post with a late shot, has flourished with the extra responsibility since Samir Nasri was injured.\n\nAgüero took the match-ball home as a souvenir and when he is playing with this menace City give the impression they could trouble the world’s best defences, never mind one as obliging as Tottenham’s."}, {"date":

"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is unusual for both managers to step away from the dugout and express a similar level of rueful disappointment. That was the case here as Steve Bruce lamented how Hull were unable to cling on to what would have been a satisfying victory, followed by Arsène Wenger airing his deep frustration.\n\nWenger was distinctly unimpressed with his team’s habit of enjoying possession but conceding self-inflicted goals due to defensive lapses. Of course, some of the accountability for that should stare the Frenchman in the face if he looks in the mirror. Defensive shortcomings are perhaps not surprising in a squad built without enough experienced defenders.\n\nHull were able to capitalise. They were enterprising, solid and Bruce’s instincts told him they were comfortable enough to see out a 2-1 lead as a fractious game ticked into stoppage time. For Arsenal, the consolation of a draw salvaged by a late combination between Alexis Sánchez and Danny Welbeck certainly reduces the heat that was beginning to boil up inside the Emirates. But considering Arsenal have won a mere two games out of eight in the Premier League this season, for all the relief of the equaliser, the general mood as the crowd drifted off was of discontent.\n\nIt was an odd, jerking see-saw of a contest. Hull began in such casual mood Arsenal could have been in charge early on as they created a string of chances. Steve Harper, the veteran goalkeeper, excelled to beat down a drive from Welbeck and then tip over Santi Cazorla’s pearl of a curling shot. The initial sluggishness from the visitors was punished in virtuoso style by Sánchez in the 13th minute. A salsa run down the right propelled him into the box, and he struck early – low and lethal – to give Arsenal the lead.\n\nNot for long. Mohamed Diamé’s powerful weaving run carved through the heart of Wenger’s makeshift defence. Nacho Monreal, the emergency centre-half in Laurent Koscielny’s absence, showed scant resistance. Mathieu Flamini was too easily pulled away, and Diamé’s dinked finish was cooly executed.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Arsène Wenger and Steve Bruce react to draw – video\n\nArsenal protested furiously to the referee, Roger East, claiming a foul on Flamini. Bruce acknowledged that Hull had been fortunate, describing the moment of controversy as an “individual piece of grappling” with a glint in his eye. “Maybe we have got a decision. You don’t get many of them at the Emirates. It was a good one to get.”\n\nIt got much worse for Arsenal as they started the second half as if in a distant reverie. Straight from kick-off Hull passed the ball neatly and found Tom Huddlestone on the right flank. There were plenty of home defenders in the box as he crossed, but Abel Hernández’s movement was so switched on, so alert, he ruthlessly exposed Per Mertesacker to head Hull in front as numerous supporters were ambling back from their half time refreshment. Bruce was thrilled at what he called “a goal to grace any arena”.\n\nThe Uruguayan had been promoted from the bench when Nikica Jelavic twisted his knee in the warm-up. That was one of three injuries Hull suffered. Harper tore a muscle in his biceps and Michael Dawson’s ankle, according to Bruce, was “the size of a basketball”.\n\nArsenal strained to get a foothold back in the game. Their play was intricate, and Hull’s defensive and midfield blocks presented a formidable barrier. The trio of Jake Livermore, Huddlestone and Diamé showed great resolve.\n\nThe Emirates air was thick with frustration. Wenger looked stressed on the touchline. The atmosphere was tempestuous. Arsenal came close when Sánchez ghosted in to glance in a fine header – matched by a superb tip-over from the replacement goalkeeper Eldin Jakupovic. Finally, the Chilean made the difference with a spurt of inspiration and a clever assist for Welbeck, who finished smartly with his left foot.\n\n“It’s the fourth time we have conceded in the last minute,” said Bruce, before suggesting that if a draw at the Emirates is frustrating that has to be a sign of the club’s progress.\n\nArsenal, though, have questions about theirs as they lie 11 points behind Chelsea. Wenger was annoyed. “It’s a big concern. The other teams win and we don’t. We had 80% possession and only one point. We were unlucky with the ref on the first goal, on the second we only blame ourselves. Defensive concentration was missing and you cannot give goals away like that.” Full of regret, both teams went home."}, {"date": "18/10/2014", "arena": "Turf Moor", "attendance": 18936, "home_team":

fourth in the Premier League table.\n\nAllardyce turns 60 on Sunday and the former Blackburn manager is staying in the north-west to mark the occasion. It did not look like being a happy Saturday afternoon after a first half that Allardyce admitted “wasn’t good enough”, but Burnley could not take their chances and West Ham made them pay. Diafra Sakho and Enner Valencia headed goals in the opening 10 minutes of the second half and, although George Boyd pulled one back, substitute Carlton Cole sealed a 3-1 victory for the Hammers.\n\nAllardyce said: “I said to the players before the game: ‘Come on lads, I need a result, because it is my birthday and, if I can’t get a result, it’s not going to be very pleasing for me, no matter that I’m with my old mates.’\n\n“A change of system was the key element for us winning the game, which then brought outstanding quality from us in wide areas. Our two centre-forwards that we bought paid massive dividends with the quality of the headers off brilliant crosses, and that, in the end, put Burnley to bed, after they had a very lively first half.\n\n“Then Carlton comes on and scores a third, when we’ve gifted them a goal to get back into it, which just summed up our performance today. It’s our first back-to-back victories and it’s fantastic that we’re now on 13 points.”\n\nValencia and Sakho were summer signings and the latter, who joined from the French side Metz, has now scored in six successive games. Allardyce said: “He is a bargain. This lad has been very exciting, and he’s excited the rest of the players.\n\n“All our players that were here last season, having had some of the depressing times that they didn’t expect, have been lifted by the new players and their performances have increased as well as the news lads hitting the ground running.\n\n“We just hope it continues. It’s too early to say what we’re going to be or what we’re going to do but things are looking very good.\n\n“If we get into December and we’re still getting results, and maintaining a top-half position, then we can start thinking about maybe maintaining that for the rest of the season.”\n\nBurnley remain without a victory since their promotion back to the top flight and this was a particularly tough defeat after all the chances they created. Inside the first 10 minutes, Boyd hit the bar and Lukas Jutkiewicz saw a goal correctly chalked off for offside, while Danny Ings headed just wide at 2-1, and substitute Ashley Barnes struck the bar late on.\n\nSean Dyche, Allardyce’s opposite number, said: “We’re learning the hard way the harsh reality of the Premier League. You have to take your chances.\n\n“It was a very good display in the first half. You know in the second half you’ve got to come out quicker than that. We came out a little bit easy.\n\n“They changed their tactics a bit – stretching the pitch quicker and playing into the top third quicker – and we just didn’t quite deal with it early enough to get a foothold in the game.\n\n“The mentality’s right, we just need to continue the challenge, which is to find that moment of truth in front of goal to score more regularly.\n\n“We’re not naive. You’ve got to win games and we have got to find a way.

A little under seven months on, they used their return as an opportunity to demonstrate the steel that has been instilled in the interim. They are a team transformed.\n\nJosé Mourinho has recognised as much. Back in March he had scribbled the word “balls” on a journalist’s notepad at this venue having been asked what his players had lacked when succumbing to Crystal Palace. He took up his pen again post-match here, scrawling “big balls” to sum up what had made the difference this time round. This had been awkward, a fractious occasion which saw players from both sides dismissed before the interval, but it ended up feeling like a show of strength played out largely to a tempo Chelsea imposed.\n\nTheir dominance was underlined by two moments of jaw-dropping quality conjured by a fluid and inventive midfield, players revelling in Nemanja Matic’s leggy presence at their back, though it was the visitors’ ease in possession which truly separated them from their spirited hosts.\n\nIn March they had been drawn into attempting to compete physically with an imposing Palace team. Here they preferred to ping passes merrily among themselves and bypass Palace’s industry. The home side may have started brightly and finished with a flurry, courtesy of Wilfried Zaha embarrassing Filipe Luis to set up Fraizer Campbell for a consolation, but they had been eclipsed for long periods. The narrow scoreline was actually rather deceptive.\n\nAdmittedly it helped that the dismissals of César Azpilicueta and Damien Delaney opened up vast expanses of space in which Chelsea could prosper, but they could still take heart from the fact they achieved all this without Diego Costa, the Spain international absent resting his hamstring for the foreseeable future. “Our only chance was to impose our game and, from minute one to 94, we did that,” said Mourinho. “We had the ball. We were always in control. We were always very far from our box. People moved the ball well. We played between the lines. And we played very well: the way Matic, Fàbregas and Oscar moved when it was 10 against 10 was fantastic.\n\n“We are a better team than last season. There has been a clear evolution in our team, and not just because we brought in two fantastic players [Fàbregas and Costa]. One of them wasn’t playing today, but our team was still fantastic. I’m pleased. But to win the title, it’s a long way away.”\n\nThey remain five points clear, their blistering start maintained and, even with Costa resting, they threaten to plunder goals throughout their lineup. Campbell and Brede Hangeland may have gone close early on for Palace, but the real bite was Chelsea’s. When Delaney stretched and connected illegally with Willian 20 yards out, Oscar strode up to belt the resultant free-kick majestically beyond a despairing Julián Speroni and into the top right-hand corner. The 23-year-old had only returned from Brazil’s friendly thrashing of Japan in Singapore on Thursday. It was as if he had never been away.\n\nDelaney would not see out the half, his first caution delivered after he slid in on Loïc Rémy and his second, almost served up as an afterthought by the referee, flashed for pulling back the same player. There were covering defenders that time which made the offence unnecessary, though Palace’s real frustration was the fact they had enjoyed a man’s advantage for under four minutes. The momentum should have been theirs after Azpilicueta’s untidy lunge, studs up, into Mile Jedinak, but hope proved horribly short-lived. The Spaniard’s challenge had been wild and right in front of the overworked official, Craig Pawson.\n\nIn truth, the referee cut an increasingly fraught figure amid the niggles and was subjected to Neil Warnock’s bellowed exasperation in the tunnel as the teams retired at the break, the home manager’s gripe perceived inconsistency. “I thought [Chelsea] influenced him at times, but he’s young,” said the Palace manager. “It’s inexperience, I guess. John Terry should have been booked for definite [for fouling Campbell] earlier on, and that set a precedent.”\n\nHis team competed for all but the lull at the start of the second half, but momentum had effectively been sucked from their display by Delaney’s departure. Fàbregas duly confirmed as much, the Spaniard exchanging passes with Eden Hazard and Oscar as he danced between dizzied defenders to convert inside Speroni’s near-post as the goalkeeper slumped the other way.\n\nIt was a goal of beauty, the classy passing and movement untouchable, and it knocked both stuffing and ambition out of the hosts until their stoppage time consolation. “The second goal was a scandal, unbelievably good,” added Mourinho. His team have shown they are capable of such brilliance.

Many would argue that every day is a retro day here, but in addition to grainy black and white images of former glories the afternoon featured nostalgic sights such as Ross Barkley, making his first appearance of the season, and Christian Benteke, starting for Villa for the first time since March. There was even a glimpse of Joe Cole, and not only on the touchline doing stretching exercises.\n\nCole got on the field for the last 10 minutes to commence his Premier League career at Villa. The game had gone by then, and Cole managed little more on the field than he had off it, but you cannot put a price on fond memories.\n\nBarkley was soon looking as if he had never been away, winning a free-kick on the edge of the area that earned Kieran Richardson the game’s first booking, then making space for a rising drive from the opposite side of the box that Brad Guzan pushed round his left‑hand upright. Everton took the lead from the resultant corner. The ball was worked back out to Leighton Baines, who whipped in a cross from the right that eluded Romelu Lukaku but was met instead by Phil Jagielka, able to continue his goalscoring form with a close-range header that left Guzan little chance.\n\n“Ross was sensational, especially in his first game back,” Roberto Martínez said. “Eight days ago he wasn’t an option. Even on Thursday I thought he might not be able to play, but he produced some phenomenal work in training in the last couple of days. That was his way of letting everyone know he was ready, and that was enough for me.”\n\nVilla lost Nathan Baker with an ankle injury shortly after going behind, and though they kept going forward there was little for Benteke or Gabriel Agbonlahor to work with. The right-back, Alan Hutton, was comfortably Villa’s most potent attacker, with a run and a shot midway through the first half that had Tim Howard worried for the first time, then a blistering break down the right that caught out Baines and led to a chance for Tom Cleverley that James McCarthy had to come across and intercept.\n\nEverton came close to extending their lead five minutes from the break, when a good shot by Séamus Coleman was matched by a diving save from Guzan, yet those highlights apart the first half was a fairly humdrum affair.\n\nThe disappointing nature of the away performance was summed up by Everton’s second goal a couple of minutes into the second half. From the moment McCarthy farmed the ball out to Barkley on the left it was eminently stoppable, but Ron Vlaar did not get enough of a touch to prevent Barkley’s underhit pass reaching Lukaku, and Guzan did not get enough of a hand to an underhit shot to prevent the ball squirming beyond him and over the line.\n\nA poor defensive effort all round, and though it will hardly rank as one of Lukaku’s most spectacular goals at least the striker was in the right place to accept the opportunity.\n\nEverton’s most expensive acquisition is returning to something like his best, as he proved by finding the pace to reach a Gareth Barry pass down the left and the power to cut back inside and win a free-kick near the area, but it is the prospect of having Barkley back that most excites supporters. He played for just over an hour, but Barkley gives Everton an attacking invention that they do not always possess and a useful element of surprise.\n\nThat said Everton managed to surprise Villa without him for the third goal. Leon Osman was smart enough to take a quick free-kick to send Baines round the back of a defence caught unawares, and Coleman turned up at the far post to bundle in a well-delivered low cross.\n\nAgbonlahor had a late chance to pull a goal back, only to see Howard produce an agile reaction save from his snap shot so Everton kept their second clean sheet of the season, an important consideration for a side that, despite Sunderland, has the worst defensive record in the division.\n\n“We were solid at the back, we stopped Villa posing a threat,” Martínez said. True enough, but Villa were extremely unthreatening opponents. “We didn’t deserve anything from the game,” Paul Lambert admitted. “All the goals were poor from our point of view and we didn’t do enough going forward.”"}, {"date": "18/10/2014", "arena": "St James' Park, Newcastle", "attendance": 51886, "home_team": {"name": "Newcastle United", "lineup": [{"name": "Tim Krul", "yellows": [],

Premier League win of the season.\n\nSecured by a rare goal from Gabriel Obertan this long striven for victory was not always entirely convincing but at least offers Alan Pardew a little respite as he endeavours to keep his seat in the home manager’s dugout.\n\n“I’ve been a manager for 700 games now and I’ve never used the word desperate before but today we were desperate to win,” said Pardew. “We were under enormous pressure but this gives us a chance to build some confidence.”\n\nThere were times when both sides looked as shaky as St James’ Park’s brand new big screen before it received emergency underpinnings on Saturday afternoon. The hiatus prompted by the need to refasten Mike Ashley’s latest toy to its moorings can hardly have helped settle nerves.\n\nYet amid much slapdash, shapeless, helter-skelter stuff – for prolonged spells it seemed more like a Championship game – Fabricio Coloccini should have given Newcastle an early lead.\n\nWhen Moussa Sissoko zipped down the left and cut the ball back Coloccini was well placed to apply a 10-yard sidefoot finish but somehow shot wide. How Pardew must have wished that chance had not fallen to a centre-half.\n\nWith ability to retain possession at a premium it was all almost as ragged as some of Leicester’s tackling. Goodness knows how spiky things might have turned had Cheick Tioté, Pardew’s feisty Ivorian midfield enforcer, not been injured.\n\nTioté’s absence heightened Newcastle’s initial sense of vulnerability and Leicester might have scored when Leonardo Ulloa imperiously shrugged off his marker before laying off adroitly to Matty James who proceeded to shoot straight at Tim Krul. The home goalkeeper subsequently looked similarly relieved when Marc Albrighton’s deceiving, dipping cross hit a post.\n\nBy now Nigel Pearson’s side were settling into a much more obdurate, organised mode that Newcastle increasingly struggled to deconstruct. The only problem was that as much as Leicester’s off the ball shape and pressing had improved, they did not seem to know what to do with the ball once they won it. “Our quality in the final third let us down,” said Pearson. “But we generally looked pretty comfortable so it’s disappointing.”\n\nThe biggest St James’ cheer came at half-time when, finally, that big screen really came into it own with the electronic transmission of the result from St Mary’s: Southampton 8 Sunderland 0.\n\nIt has been a long time since Newcastle could even dream about scoring so prolifically but their commitment could not be questioned and they might have made a breakthrough had Liam Moore not thrown himself in the way of Sissoko’s vicious shot.\n\nAlthough Moore deflected it over the bar, Pardew’s side were piling on the second-half pressure. Making it count was the issue and Papiss Cissé cursed after missing a sitter following his interception of Paul Konchesky’s appalling backpass.\n\nThe Senegal striker swiftly compensated by creating Obertan’s winner. Having initiated a rapid counterattack Cissé slid the ball to the Frenchman. Dodging defenders, Obertan slalomed to the edge of the area from where he beat Kasper Schmeichel with a shot into the bottom corner. It was the former Manchester United winger’s first goal for more than two years but he has never lacked pace and proved far too quick for Pearson’s backpedalling defence.\n\nKrul still needed to brilliantly save Danny Drinkwater’s shot but Pardew’s decision to start Obertan and once again omit Rémy Cabella, his £12m marquee summer signing from Montpellier, had been vindicated. Managers stand or fall by such calls and this one appears to have bought him valuable time. “For once,” said Pardew. “I can watch Match of the Day with a smile.”"}, {"date": "18/10/2014", "arena": " Mary's Stadium", "attendance": 29615, "home_team": {"name": "Southampton", "lineup": [{"name": "Fraser Forster", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathaniel Clyne", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "José Fonte", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Toby Alderweireld", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Bertrand", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Davis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [65]}, {"name": "Morgan Schneiderlin", "yellows": [50], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Cork", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [37], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shane Long", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [65]}, {"name": "Graziano Pellè", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [18, 69], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [80]}, {"name": "Dusan Tadic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [78], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Kelvin Davis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Maya Yoshida", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Florin Gardos", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sadio Mané", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [86], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [65], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Wanyama", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [79], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [65], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Emmanuel Mayuka", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [80], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harrison Reed", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Sunderland", "lineup": [{"name": "Vito Mannone", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Santiago Vergini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [12], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John O'Shea", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wes Brown", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Patrick van Aanholt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lee Cattermole", "yellows": [25], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Will Buckley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sebastian Larsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [60]}, {"name": "Jordi Gomez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [61]}, {"name": "Connor Wickham", "yellows": [9], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Fletcher", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Cabral", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Costel Pantilimon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Liam Bridcutt", "yellows": [82], "reds": [], "own_goals": [63], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Rodwell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [60], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Johnson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [61], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charis Mavrias", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Graham", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "So much for the Premier League manager of the month award being a curse. Ronald Koeman collected that prize in the run-up to this game, and then watched his team romp to their biggest victory for nearly a century, inflicting a defeat that Sunderland will struggle to forget.\n\nThe Saints, who started the day third in the table, went marching on thanks to their own swish play and some staggering defending by the visitors. Sunderland’s right-back, Santiago Vergini, inadvertently gave Southampton the lead by lashing the ball into his own net in the 12th minute, and that signalled the start of a barmy encounter that had home fans in raptures and Sunderland in tatters.\n\nBy the end, Sunderland were lucky to lose by the same scoreline Northampton Town suffered against Southampton, in 1921. The Sunderland manager, Gus Poyet, lamented that it was “the most embarrassed I’ve ever been on a football pitch, without a doubt”.\n\nThe odd thing was that Sunderland made the better start and showed early signs that they might pose serious problems to the Premier League’s tightest defence. Fielding all but one of the players who had registered an impressive 3-1 victory over Stoke City in their last outing, Sunderland forced their hosts backwards before Connor Wickham sent a header – from eight yards out – over the bar from a Jordi Gómez free-kick in the third minute.\n\nFive minutes later, Southampton tried to mount their first attack, but Wickham sabotaged the move by tripping the rampaging Nathaniel Clyne, prompting the referee, Andre Marriner, to issue a yellow card. That was a lone blemish on an otherwise tidy start by Poyet’s team – until, that is, the 12th minute, when Vergini produced a candidate for the most ludicrous own goal in Premier League history.\n\nThe defender was under no pressure when he ran on to the ball on the edge of his own area, yet he slashed at it in a wild panic – and at a wonky angle – sending the ball spinning past his bewildered goalkeeper. “Even if you watch that 20 times, you don’t know how it can happen,” said Poyet.\n\nA charitable observer might have suggested that the Argentina international was still jet-lagged after playing for his country in Hong Kong on Tuesday; most Southampton fans, however, just laughed at their good fortune. And the comedy was only just beginning.\n\nThere was a whiff of farce about Southampton’s second goal too, as, six minutes later, a bungled Sunderland pass ricocheted off Will Buckley’s backside to the feet of Dusan Tadic. The Serb teed up Steve Davis, who crossed low for Graziano Pellè to plunder his fifth league goal of the campaign.\n\nSebastian Larsson’s attempt to bring the visitors back into the game was foiled when Fraser Forster pushed away a curling free-kick, hit from 20 yards out.\n\nSteven Fletcher was presented with a far better chance in the 32nd minute – thanks to an incisive pass by Lee Cattermole – but the striker’s first touch was hefty, and when he went down under a challenge from Forster, the referee dismissed the strong appeals for a penalty. Sunderland were furious. “If the referee did his job, it’s a penalty and a red card – and maybe 2-1,” said Poyet. “Then we’re are talking about a different game.”\n\nSunderland’s sense of grievance deepened within minutes, when Southampton put the game out of their reach. “After that, I have no explanation for what happened,” said Poyet.\n\nKoeman identified Southampton’s third as their finest goal of the game. Jack Cork, the most underrated player at a much-lauded club, swept the ball out wide to Tadic, who waited for Cork to run to the back post before chipping the ball across to him to slam in a deserved goal from close range, despite an attempted block by Vito Mannone.\n\nAt half-time, Poyet replaced Wes Brown with Liam Bridcutt in the heart of defence and sent out the rest of the players to atone for their first-half mistakes. To no avail.\n\nVergini’s woes continued in the 50th minute, when he spurned a scoring chance, heading over from eight yards out after a well-worked free-kick.\n\nPoyet made two more changes on the hour, introducing Adam Johnson and Jack Rodwell, but that merely accelerated Sunderland’s unravelling. Three minutes later, Ryan Bertrand raced down the left and supplied Pellè. Mannone took the sting out of the Italian’s drive, from 15 yards out, and Bridcutt stopped the ball on the line – then fell over and helped it across.\n\nSouthampton showed no mercy and treated themselves to a fifth goal in the 69th minute, Tadic threading a pass through to Pellè, who applied a smart finish. Unbelievably, Sunderland contrived to get worse. Mannone gifted the hosts a sixth goal by kicking the ball straight to Tadic, who slotted it into the empty net from 20 yards out. That, at least, was fair reward for the game’s outstanding performer.\n\nTwo minutes later, Tadic provided another assist, wriggling into the box and feeding Victor Wanyama, who walloped in his side’s seventh goal.\n\n“We want 10,” cried the home crowd – and merciless Koeman made similar exhortations. “I was trying to shout from the bench to keep going, keep high-tempo, keep pressing,” said the Dutchman. “That’s football. There was 30,000 in the crowd, a fantastic atmosphere, and we kept the ambition [to score] – I like that; the players have to do that.”\n\nThey had to settle for just one more, substitute Sadio Mané whacking in the eighth as Southampton shredded Sunderland’s defence again."}, {"date": "05/10/2014", "arena": "Old Trafford", "attendance": 75294, "home_team": {"name": "Manchester United", "lineup":

"sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Perhaps times are finally changing at Manchester United and the moment that might go down as the first ray of a new dawn under Louis van Gaal came at the end of the first half.\n\nLuke Shaw made a tackle on Tony Hibbert in the area and took ball and man. The referee, Kevin Friend, pointed to the penalty spot and Leighton Baines took the kick only for David De Gea to make a fine save to his right.\n\nThis was Baines’s first miss from the spot in the Premier League. It was virtually the half’s closing action and as Old Trafford erupted and a grateful Shaw hugged De Gea, Friend blew and the 20-times champions floated into the dressing room on the back of a perfect psychological moment.\n\nThey arrived to listen to Van Gaal’s halftime talk holding a 1-0 lead that would become a 2-1 win despite a second half in which only De Gea’s excellence repelled Everton.\n\nThe manager was unhappy at how United allowed the visitors back into the contest. But now on 11 points, he agreed they are ahead of schedule. “That is what I have told my players. We are not playing good but we are already fourth in the table,” said Van Gaal. “What is coming when we are playing well? We have to do it 90 minutes.”\n\nUnited’s opener came from the consistently excellent Angel Di Maria who collected a third goal in five United appearances. On 27 minutes Rafael Da Silva swung a delivery in from the right, was aimed at the out-of sorts Radamel Falcao. It failed and Juan Mata picked up play and slipped the ball back to Di Maria, who made no mistake with a swish of his right boot.\n\nAs Van Gaal could find no place for his vice-captain, Darren Fletcher, Van Persie was leading the team in the suspended Rooney’s absence. There was a second start for Paddy McNair, a first in three matches for Mata, and Falcao hoping to break his scoring duck at the fourth attempt for his new side.\n\nTowards the end of the first half McNair was caught out in a chance that might have led to Everton’s equaliser. Baines flipped a 40-yard pass into Romelu Lukaku that bypassed the defender to easily. Lukaku brought the ball down but could not finish.\n\nYet Van Gaal was pleased with the 19-year-old. “Paddy McNair is doing great in my opinion,” he said.\n\nAfter Falcao was lucky that an aimless shot deflected off John Stones for a corner, the home No9’s profligacy was punished almost instantly. Baines picked out Steven Naismith and his flying header beat De Gea for a fourth league goal.\n\nVan Gaal is yet to restore the United swagger so when a set-back arrives confidence seeps from players and fans. This tentativeness was nearly costly seconds later when Phil Jagielka was left unmarked from a Baines corner and the defender’s header was cleared off the line by Falcao.\n\nHis next contribution came at the other end. After Tim Howard raced out to make a clearance near the touchline he found only Da Silva and the right-back turned the ball to Antonio Valencia, who recycled it to Di Maria. The Argentinian’s shot became a scuffed cross straight into the path of Falcao, who made no mistake from close range.\n\n“He needed that goal,” said Van Gaal. “I have talked with him because I thought he was forcing himself too much to score a goal. He’s a player who will normally make a goal every match and he has had to wait so long. I can understand that but now he has scored it will be better after the international break.”\n\nRoberto Martinez believed play should have stopped before the goal due to an injury to Steven Pienaar. “He receives a knock, off, goes to ground, the ball is in front of him and the ref is well aware and talking with fourth official and I just don’t understand that decision,” said the manager.\n\nUnited’s first consecutive league victories were confirmed by two late, breath-taking De Gea saves. The first came from a Leon Osman bullet, the second kept out Bryan Oviedo’s 20-yard strike.\n\n“When you hold [save] the penalty and then in the dying seconds you make magnificent saves, then you are great because you win the game because of that,” said Van Gaal.\n\nThe one concern was Luke Shaw, who limped off in what was just a second United appearance following a hamstring issue. “Shaw had a kick in the back of his knee and he has a dead knee so I think a nerve has been touched,” said his manager who does not believe it serious. “I don’t think but we have to wait.”\n\nWhile Stones was stretchered away in the dying embers with ankle ligament damage that should rule him out of England duty, this was a satisfying occasion all-round for United. Sir Bobby Charlton was present following a stomach complaint and Sir Alex Ferguson made a first return to the Old Trafford grass since retirement to announce Ji-sung Park as a club ambassador.\n\nVan Gaal’s team can enjoy the two-week pause in action.\n\nMan-of-match David de Gea"}, {"date": "05/10/2014", "arena": "Stamford Bridge", "attendance": 41607, "home_team": {"name": "Chelsea", "lineup":

pitch, as if someone had spilled his pint one time too many. Wenger had already shoved his bete noire in the chest and when he went back to prolong the argument the Arsenal manager briefly pushed his face towards his old adversary so they were almost nose to nose. Those were the lingering images of a sometimes wild game when, once again, Mourinho came out on top and everyone could see exactly how far he has got under Wenger’s skin.\n\nMourinho’s superiority over Wenger has stretched now to 12 games unbeaten and the man he branded a “specialist in failure” will be fortunate to escape further action from the Football Association. Chelsea have won seven matches during that sequence and once we had waded through all the varying subplots and controversies the bottom line is the Premier League leaders have re-established a five-point advantage ahead of Manchester City – and gone nine clear of Arsenal – courtesy of Eden Hazard’s expertly taken penalty and the latest demonstration of Diego Costa’s penalty-box prowess.\n\nThat list of side-issues is fairly considerable, though, even ignoring for one moment the first-half spat between Wenger and Mourinho, with the older man very much the aggressor, that brought no apology from the Arsenal manager, but a wry offer to the journalists in his presence that it was only a “little shove” and he could show us a real one if requested.\n\nThe referee, Martin Atkinson, could feasibly have shown four red cards and his leniency was starting to feel absurd when Danny Welbeck lunged in two-footed on Cesc Fàbregas during the closing exchanges and it was deemed worthy only of a booking.\n\nYet this was not a good day for keeping by the rules and Chelsea will face some awkward questions about the head injury suffered by the goalkeeper, Thibaut Courtois, and why they let him carry on after he had been left flat out on his back, eyes closed, after his collision with Alexis Sánchez. Courtois carried on for 13 minutes before suffering a relapse and it was alarming in the extreme to see blood coming from his right ear and, later, ambulance staff sprinting into the home dressing room. He was taken to hospital and Chelsea’s decision-making is clearly open to scrutiny bearing in mind the FA brought in new regulations for head injuries at the start of the season.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Arsène Wenger discusses his shoving match with José Mourinho.\n\nWhen the two sides met last season it finished 6-0 to Chelsea to sabotage Wenger’s 1,000th match as Arsenal’s manager and left him so distressed that, for the first time ever, he refused to do his press conference. Arsenal, to give them their due, were better this time. They had spells when they looked mildly threatening and Wenger’s tete-a-tete with Mourinho followed the theme of a team that seemed determined to stand up to their opponents and show they were no soft touch.\n\nThey also have a good case for thinking that Gary Cahill should have been sent off for the scything challenge on Sánchez that persuaded Wenger to stride from his technical area to the one designated for Chelsea personnel and respond to Mourinho’s orders for a retreat by putting both hands into his chest to give him a shove and then reminding him, close-up, who was the taller, more imposing man. Wenger was justified in saying it was a red-card offence and he could also reflect on the moment, at 1-0, when Fàbregas threw himself at Jack Wilshere’s shot and the ball deflected off his hands inside the penalty area only for Atkinson to wave play on.\n\nEqually, Laurent Koscielny should have been shown a red card for halting Hazard’s brilliant run for his penalty, after the Belgian had already gone past Santi Cazorla and Calum Chambers and would have been running clear on goal if he had eluded a third man. Chambers could feasibly have been dismissed for two bookable offences before half-time and Welbeck’s studs-up challenge on Fàbregas was an even more obvious sending-off than Cahill’s. Both teams will deflect the other side’s complaints with grievances of their own but ultimately the victory came down to Chelsea’s greater penetration in attack and solidity in defence. It has become a recurring theme when these sides lock horns and the deja vu for Arsenal was compounded by the fact it was the brilliantly influential Fàbregas playing the ball for Costa to run clear and lob Wojciech Szczesny in the 78th minute.\n\nThat was Costa’s ninth goal for his new club and an offside flag spared him too much embarrassment from an inexplicable open-goal miss late on. Hazard had been a constant menace, flustering Arsenal to the extent that Mathieu Flamini strayed dangerously close to turning one of his crosses into his own net, and Wenger was entitled to be disappointed that his team did not do more to look for rustiness in Petr Cech, the replacement for Courtois.\n\nAt other points of the match, Mourinho could be seen gesturing for Wenger that it was time he stopped yapping away at the officials. The two men clearly cannot stand one another and there was no handshake at the final whistle but it was noticeable how Mourinho did not go after him in the post-match interviews. Then again, he did not have to. His team had already inflicted the more grievous damage and that, more than anything, is why Wenger gets so worked up.\n\nMan of the match Eden Hazard (Chelsea)"}, {"date": "05/10/2014", "arena":

Hands plunged deep into his pockets, the Tottenham Hotspur manager did not betray a flicker of emotion.\n\nPochettino had said that he would not celebrate against his old club, the one he had left at the end of last season for the new challenge at White Hart Lane, because he had too much respect for the people there. It was evident at full-time, as he hugged many of his former players and members of the back-room staff. The warmth was clear.\n\nBut the passions swirled inside him. Pochettino needed this. Tottenham needed this. After four Premier League matches without a win, the grumbling had started. This was better, particularly the first-half performance, and if Tottenham rode their luck towards the end, when Southampton’s pacey forward, Sadio Mané, missed a glorious chance with the goal at his mercy, the home team were just about value for the victory.\n\nThe travelling fans, the hordes in red and white who once adored Pochettino, made it clear that he was now a fallen idol. They asked him where his translator had gone, along with other, more choice chants and they were rebuked by Ronald Koeman, who has made such an impressive fist of succeeding Pochettino at St Mary’s.\n\n“I don’t agree [with the fans],” Koeman said. “Everybody deserves respect. I respect Mauricio very much and he did a great job at Southampton.”\n\nPochettino could rise above it all, and praise his players for their “big show”. His affection for Southampton will endure. “It was an emotional game for me,” he added. “It was a tough decision to leave but I still love Southampton. I can understand [the chants]. This is football. It doesn’t change my feelings.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Maurico Pochettino happy after Tottenham’s 1-0 win over Southampton.\n\nPochettino said he had “no regrets” about the decision to, although a defeat here would have made for an uncomfortable situation. Southampton had arrived in north London five points better off in the table than Pochettino’s new team.\n\nBut Tottenham pressed hard in the first half, they went close on a clutch of occasions and they fashioned the vital moment when Emmanuel Adebayor, who drifted wide a little too much for the home crowd’s liking, played the ball inside from the left for Eriksen. The midfielder’s precision swat from 20 yards fizzed into the bottom corner.\n\nJan Vertonghen had seen an early looping header cleared off the line by Ryan Bertrand and both Erik Lamela and Eriksen had worked Fraser Forster while, in the 43rd minute, Nacer Chadli surged clean through only to rattle the far post.\n\nSouthampton had arrived on the back of six straight wins (four of them in the league) and there were flashes from them, including a first-half purple patch in which Mané was prominent. He saw one shot blocked by Kyle Naughton and a dangerous cross from the right similarly repelled by the Tottenham full-back.\n\nLater Mané’s centre from the left almost allowed Morgan Schneiderlin to bundle home. Having tried and failed to force a summer transfer to White Hart Lane, that would have been quite the moment for Schneiderlin.\n\nThere was controversy when Bertrand clattered into Naughton and the Tottenham player was forced off; he left the stadium on crutches and with his right ankle in a protective boot. It was unfortunate as he has been playing, arguably, his best football for the club.\n\nThen came the flashpoint early in the second half when Mané sprinted towards the Tottenham goal and was met, shoulder-to-shoulder, by Younès Kaboul, who was the last defender.\n\nMané went down and when the referee, Mike Jones, blew for the foul, it looked as though he would have to dismiss the Tottenham captain. He opted for yellow, which was a relief to the home team. “If you make a whistle as the referee, you have to think but I think a yellow card was OK,” Koeman said.\n\nSouthampton stuck to their principles in the second half and were agonisingly close to an equaliser. After Kaboul’s miscued clearance, Victor Wanyama looked likely to score from just inside the area only for Hugo Lloris to save while, in the 84th minute, Bertrand’s devilish cross from the left was made to measure for Mané. From six yards out, he failed to apply the decisive touch.\n\nMan of the Match: Erik Lamela (Tottenham)"}, {"date": "05/10/2014", "arena": "Upton Park", "attendance": 34907, "home_team": {"name": "West Ham United", "lineup": [{"name": "Adrián", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Carl Jenkinson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Tomkins", "yellows": [49], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Winston Reid", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Cresswell", "yellows": [83], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex Song", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Morgan Amalfitano", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stewart Downing", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mauro Zárate", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [76]}, {"name": "Diafra Sakho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [59], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Enner Valencia", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [85]}], "subs": [{"name": "Kevin Nolan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [76], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matthew Jarvis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [85], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jussi Jaaskelainen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Diego Poyet", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Carlton Cole", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Reece Burke", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Elliot Lee", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Queens Park Rangers", "lineup": [{"name": "Robert Green", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nedum Onuoha", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [5], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Caulker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rio Ferdinand", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Armand Traore", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Junior Hoilett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Karl Henry", "yellows": [89], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leroy Fer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sandro", "yellows": [14], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [67]}, {"name": "Niko Kranjcar", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [78]}, {"name": "Charlie Austin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Alex McCarthy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mauricio Isla", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordon Mutch", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [78], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Richard Dunne", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eduardo Vargas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bobby Zamora", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adel Taarabt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [67], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Harry Redknapp’s autumnal trip down memory lane has proved a dead-end street for his Queens Park Rangers side. With defeats already suffered at his old haunts of Southampton and Tottenham, West Ham United completed the hat-trick thanks to Nedum Onuoha’s early own-goal and Diafra Sakho’s second-half header. “It wasn’t great,” said Redknapp afterwards. That was an understatement.\n\nGary Neville’s post-match view – “diabolical” – was a touch closer to the truth. The result leaves QPR bottom of the pile but the manner of the result will sting as much as the consequences.\n\nToothlessness in attack and flakiness at the back is a toxic combination and both were in evidence here – only Everton have conceded more, only Burnley have scored fewer. Not that West Ham will mind. Sam Allardyce’s side claimed their second home win in succession with some ease despite a stop-start performance that failed to maintain its early sparkle.\n\n“We’re short of goals and we’re short of goalscorers,” said Redknapp. “We lost Loïc Rémy right on the deadline and couldn’t get a replacement. It has not been easy. We’ve had a tough start but there’s an awful long way to go.”\n\nA lack of goals, though, is not a new problem for this Rangers side – the list of teams who outscored them in the Championship last season includes Sheffield Wednesday, Middlesbrough and Bournemouth – and they fashioned only two chances of note here.\n\nThey both fell to Charlie Austin who created the first himself midway through the opening half after flummoxing James Tomkins on the edge of the box but planted his shot too close to Adrián. The second came courtesy of an immediate impact from Bobby Zamora following his half-time introduction from the bench but Austin poked the substitute’s cross narrowly wide.\n\n“If you can’t create a goal threat then the rest of the team comes under too much pressure and ultimately cracks,” said Allardyce, whose side are up to seventh. “We’ve suffered that ourselves in the past. When you’ve got a real goalscorer in your team it makes so much difference. Look at the difference that Diego Costa has made to Chelsea.”\n\nAllardyce ensured that his side carried plenty of threat by picking an attacking XI with a front three of Mauro Zarate, Enner Valencia and Sakho, while Redknapp aimed for solidity by naming Karl Henry alongside Sandro in midfield.\n\nThe way in which the home team took the lead in the fifth minute, though, owed nothing to tactical tinkering. The excellent Stewart Downing swung in a corner and Onuoha inadvertently bundled into his own net from close range.\n\nAfter an opening spell full of verve and swagger from the home side, during which Valencia should probably have put them two up but turned wide Sakho’s cross, Rangers improved and Austin’s two missed opportunities followed.\n\nThe home side’s strut had been sucked from them, and an equaliser was looking the more likely next goal when West Ham doubled their advantage. The irrepressible Zarate let fly from distance. The ball, initially blocked, spun out to Tomkins and the defender’s hook across goal was nodded in from little more than a yard by Sakho.\n\nValencia thought he had made it 3-0 but saw his effort ruled out after intercepting Robert Green’s free-kick inside the penalty area (“I will check the rules,” promised Allardyce ominously) and Rangers huffed and puffed thereafter to little effect. Adrián was forced to tip wide a Nico Kranjcar free-kick and Adel Taarabt fizzed a long-range effort wide but the Hammers were comfortable. QPR seem in for a season that is anything but.\n\nMan of the match Stewart Downing (West Ham)"}, {"date": "04/10/2014", "arena": "KCOM Stadium", "attendance": 24281, "home_team": {"name": "Hull City",

four matches helped his side to victory over Crystal Palace.\n\nBruce brought in Diamé to bolster the Hull midfield and with the Senegal international’s contract into its last year at West Ham, he cost just £3.5m. That already seems a bargain after a debut goal against his former employers, a thunderbolt against Newcastle and the crucial headed opener in this win.\n\nBruce admits he was delighted to take advantage of uncertainty over his future in east London. “I don’t think it was the case West Ham didn’t want him but I think everybody has to make a decision when there’s 10 months left on your contract,” said Bruce. “Will you give him a new contract or are you going to cash in? West Ham obviously cashed in.\n\n“We are delighted to have brought him in. He’s got a right foot, a left foot and now he’s scored with a header. He’s not quite the complete midfielder but he’s big, he’s strong, he’s athletic, he handles the ball well, he’s good in the air, he’s got two good feet.”\n\nWhile Diamé has already gone a long way to paying back the relatively modest transfer fee, Bruce revealed he has plenty more to make up for too. Diamé scored twice against Sunderland during Bruce’s time on Wearside and played in the Wigan win that ultimately led to his dismissal.\n\n“I think he got me the sack when I was at Sunderland actually, if I’m being honest,” said Bruce. “I first came across him when he was at Wigan and blasted one in against us.”\n\nDespite dominating for long periods against Palace, with Ahmed Elmohamady and Andy Robertson a permanent threat on the flanks, the pressure did not tell until the 60th minute.\n\nTom Huddlestone and Abel Hernández had driven Hull forward and when the ball broke for Robertson he curled a wonderful cross into the six-yard box where Diamé scored with a crisp header.\n\nCity only made the game safe in the 89th minute when Jake Livermore’s perfect through ball found Nikica Jelavic. The Croat finished calmly to register his fourth of the season and ensure Hull’s first win since the opening day defeat of Queens Park Rangers.\n\nFor Palace there was less to cheer, with a curiously flat performance hardly befitting a side chasing a third successive victory. Yet their manager, Neil Warnock, used his post-match press conference as a platform to fight Fraizer Campbell’s corner. A one-time Hull loanee, he was booed relentlessly by the home fans having twice turned down a permanent move.\n\nBut Warnock was more annoyed at a perceived lack of consistency from the referee, Mike Dean. “I had to take Fraizer Campbell off because he got a silly booking but in the first minute he was body-checked, which should have been a yellow card,” he said.\n\n“Then just before half-time, there’s an elbow from [Michael] Dawson – I’ve seen red cards for less than that. The referee doesn’t see that but he sees all the little niggles that poor old Fraizer gets booked for.\n\n“Referees should be in a position to see elbows like that and know it’s not an accident. It’s dangerous play. They need to be educated better, even though he’s one of our better refs.”"}, {"date": "04/10/2014", "arena": "The King Power Stadium", "attendance": 31448, "home_team": {"name": "Leicester City",

will not just be victories over Manchester United, however fantastic they are, upon which Leicester City’s Premier League future will be determined but their ability to see off potential relegation rivals, so conceding an equaliser six minutes into stoppage time to Burnley could be a bitter blow.\n\nNigel Pearson, the Leicester manager, was rather dismissive of Burnley’s approach, after the two sides automatically promoted from the Championship ultimately cancelled each other out. But he was pleased his team had at least dominated the game. However, dropping so deep that they gave Burnley the late opportunity to win and convert a free-kick, expertly dispatched by Ross Wallace, after Michael Kightly had ended a club record goal drought of 10 hours and 55 minutes to score a first equaliser, smacked of carelessness.\n\nLeicester have enjoyed a superb start to the season, peaking with that memorable 5-3 triumph over United last time out here, where they have lost once in 19 games, but beating and keeping above teams such as Burnley will be paramount in their bid to stay up.\n\nPearson has his team playing with a zest and dynamism that merited the lead they twice took on Saturday but they are not so much better than Sean Dyche’s injury-stricken side – who moved off the bottom of the table with this point – that they can afford to take their foot off the gas.\n\nInjuries mean Burnley are not only lacking Danny Ings, who could be back after the international break, and Sam Vokes, their strike partnership in last season’s successful promotion campaign, but an entire midfield so a point here is not to be sniffed at. “I thought we were terrific,” Dyche said. “This was much more of a reminder of what we’re about, with the will and the determination. Teams have only come away from us once, last Sunday [in the 4-0 defeat at West Bromwich Albion].”\n\nPearson described this as “a bit of a Championship game” as Burnley “didn’t come here to play any fluid football”.\n\nHe added: “We did OK, could have done slightly better, but overall I was pretty pleased with the way we dominated the game. We did enough to have won. They didn’t really trouble us today.\n\n“We’re better than we were last year, and I don’t think they’re as good as they were last season, on today’s evidence, although I know they’ve got injuries. But what they do have is spirit.”\n\nLeicester looked to have done enough to win thanks to their more enterprising play and goals from Jeff Schlupp and Riyad Mahrez, their energetic wide men, but they sat too deep in the latter stages and paid the price.\n\nAs the home side started progressively with two up front, Mahrez, the Algerian, was permitted too much space to cross from the right for Schlupp to turn in his first Premier League goal.\n\nBut shortly after Burnley had broken their club record time without a goal, set in 1970, they finally relaxed sufficiently to score.\n\nThe man who had given them the lead on the opening Monday of the season to antagonise Chelsea into life in a match which they lost 3-1, Scott Arfield, was allowed to cross from the left for Lukas Jutkiewicz to head down for Kightly to poke home with his studs.\n\nYet the excitement must have gone to their heads for within a minute Leicester had regained the lead. Jamie Vardy’s cross from the left wing deflected up off Jason Shackell perfectly for Mahrez to run in unmarked and head home.\n\nJust as Leicester seemed to have done enough, their willingness to sit back cost them dearly. Seven minutes of stoppage time were added, mainly for the late delay caused when Kieran Trippier was slowly taken off the field on a stretcher. With one minute remaining, Matty James, the Leicester substitute, tripped Arfield. From the free-kick, Wallace, a Burnley substitute, curled his shot into the top corner for Burnley’s fourth draw of the season."}, {"date": "04/10/2014", "arena": "Anfield", "attendance": 44708,

Southampton, to set Liverpool on the road to victory against West Bromwich Albion, not the most convincing of victories, as it happens, but Anfield was glad of it just the same. Albion came to Merseyside having won their past three games, form that Liverpool, at the moment, can only dream about.\n\nBrendan Rodgers had responded to a fourth Liverpool defeat in the opening nine games by dropping Mario Balotelli and Lazar Markovic to the bench, the former carrying the can – a little unfairly – for a poor overall team performance in Basel, the latter having failed to make a significant impression on English football since signing from Benfica.\n\nIf the idea was to energise Liverpool and bring back some of the quick-fire confidence of last season, it was not a complete success. Rickie Lambert did not really step up to the plate as line leader in Balotelli’s absence, failing to connect with an early cross from Lallana, and too often finding his first touch letting him down. The former Southampton striker did bring the first save of the game from Ben Foster, midway through the first half, after neatly controlling a searching pass from Martin Skrtel, though – when he took too long over his next penalty-area opportunity, and saw the chance disappear – it was hard to see how Lambert was bringing any more mobility to the Liverpool attack than Balotelli.\n\nA lack of meaningful movement seems to be Liverpool’s problem at present. Raheem Sterling and Philippe Coutinho kept getting caught in possession, and though Jordan Henderson was promoted to a more forward role, there were still very few occasions when the home side got runners beyond the West Brom back line.\n\nHaving started quite cautiously, the visitors gradually worked their way into the game, and were arguably getting on top by the end of the first half, when Liverpool took the lead. Saido Berahino brought a save from Simon Mignolet after Javier Manquillo inexplicably gave the ball away on half way, and might have done better with a free header from Sébastien Pocognoli’s cross, three minutes before the interval, than put it wide.\n\nYet, just as West Brom were taking heart from keeping Liverpool scoreless and looking forward to the break, the home side conjured an attack down the left that was out of keeping with their sluggish first-half performance.\n\nHenderson farmed the ball out to Lallana, who skipped easily into the penalty area to place a shot across Foster and into the far corner. All of West Brom’s hard work was undone at a stroke and Liverpool had a lead that – while not exactly undeserved – was something of an unexpected bonus at the end of a laboured first half.\n\nWest Brom are no pushovers under Alan Irvine, however, and came out for the second half showing just as much self belief. The penalty Dejan Lovren conceded to allow them back into the game was unnecessary and, quite possibly, outside the box, too, though the fact that the centre half had to stretch to prevent Berahino reaching Stéphane Sessègnon’s pass on the edge of the area showed the visitors were looking for a way back into the game.\n\nBerahino equalised confidently from the spot, though parity only lasted for four minutes. Liverpool might have had a penalty at the other end when Craig Gardner climbed all over Sterling, but the referee was either unmoved or played a good advantage. The ball came back to Henderson, who calmly sidefooted through a crowd of players to restore Liverpool’s lead.\n\nWith Balotelli already on for the last half hour, the stage was set for Liverpool to put the game to bed and possibly score a few more confidence-boosting goals in the process, yet things are just not happening for them as smoothly this season as they did last. When Balotelli sent Sterling clear on goal with a precisely timed pass, the England player popped up in the right place and showed all the necessary acceleration, only to see the chance go begging when an unwanted touch showed too much of the ball to the goalkeeper. Something similar occurred in Switzerland, so either Liverpool’s luck is out, or it is just Sterling going through a rough patch.\n\nThe grandstand finish never arrived. While Balotelli and Steven Gerrard both saw shots saved before the end, West Brom refused to collapse, and the score remained the same.\n\n"}, {"date": "04/10/2014", "arena": "Stadium of Light", "attendance": 42713, "home_team": {"name": "Sunderland", "lineup": [{"name": "Vito Mannone", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Billy Jones", "yellows": [64], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Santiago Vergini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John O'Shea", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Patrick van Aanholt", "yellows": [67], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lee Cattermole", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Will Buckley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [60]}, {"name": "Sebastian Larsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [71]}, {"name": "Jordi Gomez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [71]}, {"name": "Connor Wickham", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [4], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Fletcher", "yellows": [70], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [23, 79], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Costel Pantilimon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Liam Bridcutt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [71], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wes Brown", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Rodwell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [71], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Johnson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [60], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jozy Altidore", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charis Mavrias", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Stoke City", "lineup": [{"name": "Asmir Begovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Bardsley", "yellows": [66], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Shawcross", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marc Wilson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marc Muniesa", "yellows": [27], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven N'Zonzi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Glenn Whelan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marko Arnautovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charlie Adam", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [15], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [70]}, {"name": "Victor Moses", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [18]}, {"name": "Peter Crouch", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [78]}], "subs": [{"name": "Erik Pieters", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robert Huth", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stephen Ireland", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jon Walters", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [78], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Oussama Assaidi", "yellows": [62], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [18], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bojan", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [70], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Thomas Sorensen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Two strikers in the starting XI, three goals and a first Premier League win of the season. For once the numbers stacked up for Sunderland as Gus Poyet was rewarded for some ruthless decision-making allied to a slightly more dashing gameplan with this criticism-assauging victory.\n\nPoyet’s quest for that hitherto elusive league win involved dropping both Jack Rodwell, his marquee summer signing, and Adam Johnson to the bench. Considering that the pair cost £10m apiece to purchase from Manchester City and have both played for England that was quite a statement.\n\n“Leaving Jack and Johnno out were big decisions but it was for the benefit of the team,” said Poyet, who saw the recalled Steven Fletcher score his first two goals of 2014.\n\n“It’s a very important win. We knew we were difficult to play against but, without winning there were always some doubts. Now we can say we’ve only lost one league game in seven. Something good’s happening here and we’ve confirmed it.”\n\nThe Uruguayan’s strategy soon seemed justified when Connor Wickham – deployed in a flexible wide role on the left of Sunderland’s 4-1-4-1 formation – gave the Wearsiders the lead in what was to prove an entertainingly open match.\n\nPoyet’s decision to start both him and Fletcher was vindicated as the Scotland striker connected with a fifth-minute throw-in before turning his marker and crossing for Wickham to direct a header beyond Asmir Begovic.\n\nWith Lee Cattermole – a midfielder Mark Hughes attempted, forlornly, to sign for Stoke last January – prompting chants of “Cattermole for England,” Sunderland looked in the mood to atone for last month’s Capital One Cup defeat here against the same opponents.\n\nEven so, this early optimism was momentarily deflated when Victor Moses advanced down the left and slipped a pass to Charlie Adam. The Scotland midfielder should rarely be underestimated and, sure enough, he proceeded to dodge one marker before threading a clever low left foot shot between John O’Shea’s legs and into the bottom corner.\n\nThat equaliser flattered to deceive on a day which marked a dip in Stoke’s largely impressive evolution under Tony Pulis’s successor. “Charlie was one of our few bright lights,” said Hughes. “It was a fine finish from him but it wasn’t great from us, we didn’t create enough.”\n\nSensing opportunity, Sunderland rallied. Fletcher has struggled to win Poyet over this season, sometimes failing to even make the bench but, restored at centre forward, he proved his worth by losing Marc Wilson, his supposed minder, meeting Jordi Gómez’s cross and whipping a header past Begovic.\n\nAlthough Will Buckley’s audacious lob subsequently brought the very best out of the visiting goalkeeper, Stoke sporadically looked like getting back into things. Indeed only an excellent Vito Mannone save prevented Peter Crouch from equalising with an acrobatic volley on the brink of half-time.\n\nPoyet received a further warning as Steven N’Zonzi and friends began imposing themselves in midfield, leaving Cattermole with an awful lot of fires to fight. Fresh legs were called for and Johnson’s introduction was followed by that of Rodwell and Liam Bridcutt as Buckley, Larsson and Gomez made way.\n\nOnce more, Sunderland’s manager exhibited a golden touch in the decision-making department. Revitalised, Sunderland scored again after Wickham’s defender-disorientating surge, during which the England Under-21 international did extremely well to remain on his feet, carried him into the area and Fletcher’s left-foot shot did the rest. Poyet should play those two together more often.\n\n“They were outstanding,” said Sunderland’s manager. “I’m pleased for Fletch; I know how hard he found it when I left him out of the squad. He was professional but he wasn’t happy.”\n\nWickham’s willingness to step to the left helped. “I asked Connor to go a little bit wide,” added Poyet. “And he likes it, which surprises me.” Presumably in a good way."}, {"date": "04/10/2014", "arena": "The Liberty Stadium", "attendance": 20622, "home_team": {"name": "Swansea City", "lineup": [{"name": "Lukasz Fabianski", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jazz Richards", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Federico Fernandez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Williams", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Neil Taylor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sung-Yueng Ki", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonjo Shelvey", "yellows": [73], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathan Dyer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [86]}, {"name": "Gylfi Sigurdsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [86]}, {"name": "Wayne Routledge", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [50], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wilfried Bony", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [17], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Marvin Emnes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [86], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Carroll", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bafétimbi Gomis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jefferson Montero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [86], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gerhard Tremmel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Bartley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Liam Shephard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Newcastle United", "lineup": [{"name": "Tim Krul", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daryl Janmaat", "yellows": [88], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mike Williamson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fabricio Coloccini", "yellows": [61], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paul Dummett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gabriel Obertan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cheick Tiote", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Moussa Sissoko", "yellows": [88], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Colback", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [69]}, {"name": "Yoan Gouffran", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [58]}, {"name": "Papiss Cisse", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [43, 75], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [85]}], "subs": [{"name": "Vurnon Anita", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ayoze Pérez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [85], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Massadio Haidara", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rémy Cabella", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rob Elliot", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sammy Ameobi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [58], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Emmanuel Riviere", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [69], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "It took 23 minutes before the Newcastle United fans had seen enough.

Gabriel Obertan, making his first league start for 18 months, drove narrowly wide early on after a mistake from Gylfi Sigurdsson.\n\nBut 37 seconds later, in the 17th minute, Newcastle went 1-0 down. Wilfried Bony exchanged neat passes with Sigurdsson and left Paul Dummett trailing before clipping a simple shot past the goalkeeper Tim Krul. It was Bony’s first goal of the season – and just too easy.\n\nPardew stood impassively in his technical area, arms folded. It could have got worse for him, with Ki Sung-yueng nodding wastefully wide from a Sigurdsson free-kick and Krul saving smartly from a Bony volley.\n\nBut Newcastle rallied and drew level two minutes before the break. Obertan crossed low from the right and Cissé nipped in at the near post to touch in his third goal of the season. At last, the Geordies had something to cheer.\n\nIt did not last long, though. Swansea regained their lead, without having to work too hard, when Moussa Sissoko gave the ball away cheaply and Sigurdsson released Routledge to dink in a delightful effort over Krul.\n\nKrul made a superb diving stop to deny Bony before Newcastle equalised again. The substitute Sammy Ameobi crossed in the 75th minute and Cissé was on hand to steer it past the exposed Krul.\n\nBoth sides gave it a go towards the end – Swansea out of embarrassment at not having despatched their lowly rivals earlier, Newcastle out of desperation to get the win that they so desperately crave.\n\nIt made for a stirring climax to an essentially drab contest but one that left Garry Monk, the Swansea manager feeling frustrated. “That was two points dropped,” Monk said. “The goals conceded were very poor, the lack of concentration cost us dearly.\n\n“We knew Newcastle were fighting for their lives and they showed that in their performance. The game was there for us to win if we did the right things. But possession came too easy to us and we got sloppy. That was our downfall.”\n\nThe Newcastle fans did not mind. They applauded their players and manager at the end – when was the last time they did that? – and Pardew turned briefly towards the black-and-white masses and returned the compliments with a brief clap of his hands.\n\nThere is still a long way to go before talk of a recovery can be bandied about, but it’s a start."}, {"date": "04/10/2014", "arena": "Villa Park", "attendance": 32964,

Yaya Touré was scoring again, the supporters were singing his name and Manuel Pellegrini’s team were producing the sort of result that served as a reminder why they became champions in the first place. Frustration has been a familiar feeling for them in a stuttering title defence and, after 81 minutes, a second stalemate of the embryonic campaign beckoned.\n\nThen Touré intervened. Twenty yards out, confronted by a phalanx of defenders, he accepted Fernando’s pass and bent his shot between Alan Hutton and Philippe Senderos. Aston Villa’s resistance was ended. So, with it, was Touré’s drought. His previous league goal came against the same opponents in May; it was a landmark strike, making the Ivorian only the second central midfielder of the Premier League era to register 20 in a season, a formidable achievement that was followed by a fallow period.\n\nA belated first against top-flight opposition in five months brought the loudest chorus of Touré’s name in that time. If relations were soured over the summer by the unnecessary furore his agent, Dimitri Seluk, created, with his bizarre accusation that City did not even provide a cake to celebrate his client’s birthday, they are undergoing a repair now. His goal might be said to represent the icing on the cake for Pellegrini, who handled a difficult situation diplomatically. “I think it was a misunderstanding,” the Chilean claimed, downplaying the farrago in typical fashion and attributing Touré’s substandard start to the season to the summer loss of his brother, Ibrahim.\n\nA goal marked a return to form. Perhaps as significantly, a midfielder often accused of neglecting his defensive duties had slid in to make a fine block and take the sting off Andreas Weimann’s shot on one of Villa’s few attacks. “He can be criticised for one or two weeks but I know perfectly the way he thinks and the way he can play so I never had a problem about that,” added Pellegrini. City’s problems were diminishing by the time Sergio Agüero delivered his sixth goal of the season, the Argentinean rifling in a shot after he was found by James Milner.\n\n“For 81 minutes, the lads were excellent,” stated Paul Lambert, the Aston Villa manager. It was a day when his defence and the woodwork were allies in an admirable rearguard action. Brad Guzan did not have a save to make until the second half, but his back four were overworked. Nathan Baker produced a masterclass in defensive defiance, excelling with a series of blocks to cap his renaissance, and Aly Cissokho hacked off his line to deny Edin Dzeko. It was the culmination of a well-worked set-piece, with Milner finding David Silva, who crossed for the Bosnian.\n\nIt was another indication of the Englishman’s influence. Milner was the instigator of many of City’s finer chances, playing with trademark persistence and no little skill. One pass, when Agüero hit the base of the upright, was Silva-esque. It was the second time City had hit the post. Aleksandar Kolarov clipped it with a typically ferocious shot from an acute angle.\n\n“I was thinking that this was not our day,” Pellegrini confessed. But his side were relentless. It amounted to a fine response to difficulty. Silva grew in prominence in the final half-hour as Guzan became busier and Villa could not quite hang on.\n\nThey adopted their tried-and-trusted tactics against the elite, of playing without possession and springing quick counter-attacks. It was a ploy that threatened to work as Charles N’Zogbia spun away from Fernandinho and sprinted 40 yards to unleash a shot that whistled past the post. Then, seconds after Agüero struck wood, N’Zogbia released Kieran Richardson, who was thwarted by Joe Hart. “If you get a chance, you have to take it,” said Lambert, whose side have still only scored four league goals.\n\nAt least Christian Benteke returned as a substitute after six months on the sidelines with a ruptured Achilles tendon. However, an attacking boost followed a striking disappointment, as the ill Gabby Agbonlahor pulled out after the warm up, and fortune has not favoured them. “I have never known a run like this,” said the Scot, whose side have faced last season’s top four in consecutive games. “The fixtures have been pretty unkind.”"}, {"date": "29/09/2014", "arena": "Bet365 Stadium", "attendance": 26332,

Newcastle United lost at Stoke. Peter Crouch’s first-half goal condemned Newcastle to a defeat that leaves them joint-bottom of the Premier League and, in the process, brings that bizarre interview Ashley gave to a reporter outside the Golden Lion pub in Soho on Thursday night sharply into focus. Either Ashley has a strange sense of humour or Pardew is toast.\n\nThe Newcastle owner was looking on from the stands here as his club slumped to a 10th league defeat in 14 matches. Only Burnley’s pitiful goal return is sparing them from the ignominy of propping up the table. All the while the protests from the Newcastle supporters are getting louder, calling for the manager’s head and railing against Ashley’s regime. It is, in short, a terrible mess.\n\nAt one stage in the closing minutes both sets of fans were singing “You’re getting sacked in the morning” as Pardew stood on the edge of his technical area, looking like the loneliest man in the world. There was another chastening experience to endure at the final whistle, when the Newcastle manager applauded the visiting supporters – many of whom were holding aloft “Pardew out” placards – and received a volley of abuse in return.\n\nEven by Newcastle’s standards the build-up to this game had been surreal. The image of Ashley performing a throat-cutting gesture when discussing Pardew’s future with a journalist after that chance meeting in London last week will take some beating. “Dead. Finished. Over. One more game, then that’s it,” Ashley is reported to have said. Ashley’s lawyers, and Newcastle, subsequently claimed that the remarks were made in jest. How Pardew and the Newcastle fans must have chuckled.\n\nIt did not take long for the frustration to come to the surface on a dank evening in the Potteries. It was the 28th minute when the first “We want Pardew out” chant emanated from the visiting end. By that point Newcastle were already behind to the goal that would decide the game.\n\nWith Stoke denied a stonewall penalty in the first half, when Yoan Gouffran somehow got away with barging Victor Moses over, and unfortunate to see Marko Arnautovic’s shot cannon off the upright early in the second period, Newcastle could have no complaints about the result. Despite seeing plenty of the ball in the first half, Newcastle looked devoid of ideas going forward throughout, although they did come within inches of salvaging a point six minutes from time.\n\nGabriel Obertan’s cross dropped invitingly for Jack Colback but the former Sunderland midfielder, from inside the six-yard box, hammered his shot against the crossbar. Colback, Pardew said, was “beating himself up” in the dressing room for failing to snap up a chance that might have brought a little bit of respite for the manager.\n\nAlan Pardew leaves the field after his side’s defeat. Photograph: Laurence Griffiths/Getty Images\n\nInstead Pardew looked like a broken man when he addressed the media afterwards. He said that he would carry on fighting but his body language suggested that he is expecting a tap on the shoulder any minute. It has got to the point where it might even come as a relief.\n\nFor Stoke and Mark Hughes the emotions were very different. After picking up five points on their travels, including a win at Manchester City, this was their first victory at home in the league this season. Stoke had not even scored at the Britannia Stadium before Crouch, towering above Fabricio Coloccini, headed in an inswinging cross from the excellent Moses. “Victor’s a man on a mission because he hasn’t had a lot of football in the last two seasons,” said Hughes.\n\nPeter Crouch celebrates scoring. Photograph: Paul Greenwood/BPI/REX\n\nThe Stoke manager should have been spared a nervous finale but the home team’s failure to kill the game meant that there was always a flicker of hope for Newcastle. Only Craig Pawson, the referee, knows why he failed to award a penalty when Gouffran upended Moses. Mame Diouf pulled a hamstring in the lead-up to that breakaway, forcing Hughes into an early change that saw Arnautovic introduced in the 23rd minute. The Austrian acquitted himself well on the Stoke right.\n\nNewcastle, for all their possession before the break, took 43 minutes to force Asmir Begovic into a serious save, when Daryl Janmaat drilled a 30-yard shot that the Stoke goalkeeper turned round the post. Pardew introduced Papiss Cissé at the start of the second half but this time there was to be no repeat of the Senegalese’s heroics against Hull.

With Ray Lewington, Roy Hodgson’s assistant, and Gary Neville, the England coach, looking on from the stands, it was not a bad day for Berahino to demonstrate his predatory instincts in front of goal.\n\nHodgson is aware of Berahino from his time in charge at Albion and the England manager mentioned the forward as a prospect back in December, when the World Cup draw was being made. An England Under-21 international, Berhaino started last season in similar fashion to this one – a year ago to the day he got the winner at Old Trafford to take his tally to five – but he lost his way badly during the second half of the campaign and picked up a reputation for being a difficult character.\n\nIrvine, however, seems to be pressing the right buttons to get the best out of Berahino, and with Hodgson’s striking options so limited, the possibility of a call-up is not that outlandish.\n\n“If he keeps on playing like that and he keeps on scoring goals, he’ll get all those rewards,” Irvine said. “I don’t think Roy will be looking and saying he’s too young or anything like that. He’ll put him in as he has shown already if he feels that he is the best player for the position. But right now, Saido’s got to keep working the way he does. He stays to do finishing after training every day, and he’s getting the benefits from all of that.” ”\n\nWhile this was a hugely satisfactory result for Irvine, who had maintained after the Everton match that nothing was quite as bad as it seemed, Sean Dyche was unable to take any positives from his heaviest defeat as Burnley manager.\n\nAfter keeping clean sheets in their previous three games, Burnley were all over the place defensively against Albion and conceded twice from corners. At the other end of the pitch nothing has changed. It is now 616 minutes – dating back to Scott Arfield’s strike against Chelsea in the opening game of the season – since they scored.\n\nBurnley’s prospects had looked bleak by half-time. Dawson, a player Burnley had tried to sign in the summer, headed home Brunt’s corner and a second goal soon followed from another training ground routine. This time Dorrans darted to the near post to flick on James Morrison’s corner for the unmarked Berahino to nod in from inside the six-yard box.\n\nThe same two players combined in the 56th minute, when Berahino sprinted on to Dorrans’ pass before beating Tom Heaton with an angled shot into the far corner.\n\nWith Albion becoming a little complacent, Burnley finally registered a notable attempt on goal when Ben Foster repelled Lukas Jutkiewicz’s powerful header midway through the second half, but normal service resumed late on when Dorrans converted Cristian Gamboa’s cut-back to complete the rout.\n\n“That’s a massive learning curve today,” said Dyche, whose team are now bottom. “We were carrying too many players.”.\n\nMan of the match Graham Dorrans (West Bromwich)"}, {"date":

the bottom half of the table and both defences coming in for criticism, a tight, low-scoring game was never the goalfest many had expected.\n\nThough the back lines held up well enough, it was the paucity of attacking invention that kept the score down. Meetings between these two last season were exciting affairs with subplots of title ambitions and Champions League qualification.\n\nThis was a more humdrum version, which looked like being settled by Steven Gerrard’s 10th derby goal until Phil Jagielka stole a point with a thunderous drive in stoppage time.\n\nThat was a twist in the tail a plodding script hardly merited. Liverpool were deserving of a win on the basis that Everton had hardly produced an attack of note, yet they switched off a few seconds too early in assuming Jagielka would recycle Dejan Lovren’s clearing header by conventional means. The Everton captain decided to try his luck instead, hitting an unstoppable shot from 25 yards that was heading for Simon Mignolet’s top corner as soon as it left the outside of his right boot.\n\n“It was an incredible strike,” a relieved Roberto Martínez said. “It would have been in any game, but as it happened to be in the last minute of this one it might just have been the best strike I’ve ever seen.\n\n“We weren’t at our best, but we passed a test of character. We refused to accept defeat, and for that reason it might be our most pleasing result of the season.”\n\nNaturally, Liverpool did not see it quite like that. “We didn’t get what we deserved,” Brendan Rodgers said. “We are getting back to the intensity we need, the performance was at a much better level, we were excellent for 91 minutes but that wasn’t quite enough. And we should have had a penalty.”\n\nWhen the dust had settled after a dramatic finale honours were even, both captains were on the scoresheet, and both sides looked a shadow of their last season selves.\n\nA predictably frantic first 20 minutes were dominated by Liverpool, who had the Everton penalty area under siege from the outset and were only kept out by Tim Howard’s reactions and Gareth Barry’s spiky resilience. The goalkeeper produced a save from Mario Balotelli’s long-range free-kick, then bettered it with a close-range stop when Adam Lallana was allowed a free header from the resultant corner.\n\nTreading a fine line after picking up an early booking for a foul on Lallana, Barry also gave away the free-kick against Balotelli and was lucky not to concede a penalty when Raheem Sterling’s rising shot struck his upraised arm. The referee, Martin Atkinson, remained unmoved despite Liverpool’s furious protests. “It was practically a save,” Rodgers said. “Short of grabbing the ball with both arms it could hardly have been more obvious. Martin Atkinson had a good look at it as well. Maybe the fact that Barry had already been booked was at the back of his mind.”\n\nOn this occasion, fortune evened itself out. Television replays showed Romelu Lukaku had a legitimate penalty claim turned down in the opening minutes when a tug by Alberto Moreno pulled the Belgian off balance out of sight of the referee.\n\nAfter weathering the early storm, the visitors began to get forward a little more when the giddiness died down and a regular game broke out. Lukaku produced a shot from the edge of the area that Mignolet saved comfortably, then when Leighton Baines beat Lazar Markovic to find his way behind the Liverpool defence on the left, his low cross intended for Lukaku was cut out in front of goal by Lovren.\n\nAs the interval approached, the contest was enjoyably end to end, with Jordan Henderson seeing a shot beaten out by Howard and Kevin Mirallas skipping away down the left only to injure himself as he prepared to cross, leaving on a stretcher and playing no further part in the game.\n\nWide out on the left, Sterling was not as involved in the game as much as Liverpool would have liked, though he had the best chance of opening the scoring in the first half right on the stroke of the interval. Barry uncharacteristically gave the ball away on halfway, inviting Henderson to break forward and find Sterling advancing into the area, but Howard once again came to Everton’s rescue by keeping out an angled shot.\n\nAfter an hour, Rodgers introduced Philippe Coutinho for the ineffective Markovic, doubtless hoping the Brazilian could inject some cleverness or creativity into a game sorely lacking either. Though Coutinho did improve Liverpool’s passing options, the goal that broke the deadlock shortly after his arrival was an old Anfield standby, a shot from Steve Gerrard straight from a free-kick. Baines was adjudged to have brought down Balotelli on the edge of the area and Gerrard beat Howard from 20 yards. After his earlier heroics, the goalkeeper must have been disappointed. He seemed in a reasonable position to deal with a strike that was neither unstoppable nor unreachable but could not get a firm enough hand to the ball.\n\nHoward was relieved Liverpool did not extend their lead two minutes later when Balotelli’s effort from Sterling’s cross struck his bar, a miss that Liverpool only started to rue in the first minute of added time when Jagielka stepped up to claim his place in derby history."}, {"date": "27/09/2014", "arena": "Stamford Bridge", "attendance": 41616, "home_team": {"name": "Chelsea", "lineup": [{"name": "Thibaut Courtois", "yellows": [], "reds":

team had been laid low by a virus; this time they were brought to their knees by a phenomenon they found similarly impossible to defend against and equally destructive to their morale and their victory chances, in the rather more human shape of Diego Costa.\n\nThe Chelsea striker scored one – his eighth goal in six league matches – and created another before coming off to spend the last 10 minutes resting his suspect hamstrings, the leaders’ victory assured. It was a fine if imperfect display from the Spaniard, whose passing outside the penalty area was often imprecise, but, more importantly, his movement was constant and menacing, and when the ball fell his way in the area he was typically devastating.\n\nJosé Mourinho said that goals were of particular importance for Costa given that he is doing “almost nothing” in training. “For me what’s important is that the team scores enough goals to win,” he said. “But I know it’s good for him and for his confidence, especially for a player like him who’s not training as he should, so he cannot be on top of his game.”\n\nHaving complained earlier in the week that Spain remain free to select Costa despite his injury concerns, Mourinho now pinpointed the period next month in which they have back-to-back qualifiers against Slovakia and Luxembourg as key to Costa’s long-term fortunes for club and country. ‚\n\n“If he stays here, and spends 15 days just on treatment and recovery and making the muscle stronger, he has the perfect chance to be top for Chelsea and for the national team,” he said. “If he doesn’t have this chance, he will always play one game, and the next he’s in trouble.”\n\nHe played this game, and it was Villa who were in trouble. The visitors had built their impressive early-season form on defensive solidity rather than attacking brio – they arrived here with three clean sheets and just eight shots on target in five previous games – but a team that struggles so badly to create and take chances is unlikely to prosper against this calibre of opponent.\n\nThey were never overrun but Thibaut Courtois made only one save, from Alan Hutton’s tame effort at the end of a long individual run in the 69th minute, despite a flurry of almost-chances at the start of each half.\n\n“Against teams like this, when you get a chance you have to score,” said the Villa manager, Paul Lambert. “But when you come here, if you get beat you’ve got to leave with your confidence intact, which we certainly are. Other than failing to get a goal, I couldn’t ask for anything more.”\n\nFrom Lambert’s perspective there was an element of misfortune about the first and third goals, with Willian benefitting from handy ricochets on both occasions.\n\nFor the first, the Brazilian was sent scurrying down the right by Branislav Ivanovic and, with all team-mates to his left marked, he shot low and hard towards the near post. Brad Guzan pushed the ball straight back into his path, and this time Willian pulled back to the now-clear Oscar, whose finish trundled through Philippe Senderos’s legs on its way to goal.\n\nWillian came close to a second in the 15th minute when he ran on to Costa’s excellent backheel flick and set off down the centre but Nathan Baker diligently shepherded him wide of goal, from where his shot was deflected the wrong side of the near post.\n\nThough their advantage remained slender, Chelsea displayed the class and confidence that befits league leaders and title favourites, with Oscar beating Senderos with a drop of the shoulder that provoked not so much cheers from the nearby fans as a collective sigh of pleasure, and Eden Hazard, who was otherwise becalmed, attempting a showy rabona.\n\n“I don’t remember feeling fear or scared or not comfortable,” said Mourinho. “The team always gave the feeling that everything was under control.”\n\nAll the more so when, in the 59th minute, the Villa defence was momentarily mesmerised by some neat triangular passing on the left and forgot to keep an eye on Costa, who scored with a powerful header when César Azpilicueta finally speared in a cross.\n\nTwenty minutes later, Aly Cissokho having in the meantime cleared Oscar’s casual effort as it rolled towards the line, Costa was found in too much space on the left, from where he cut inside, cut inside a little more and then sent in a shot that bounced off Guzan and Cissokho before landing helpfully between Willian and an empty net."}, {"date": "27/09/2014", "arena":

1988 when Colin Clarke, a Northern Ireland international striker now aged 52, scored both goals and the Stretford End was a gaping terrace emblazoned with a Wonderfuel Gas sign.\n\nYet a lot of teams have buried a hoodoo at Old Trafford over the last couple of seasons. Swansea City have picked up their first win here and Newcastle their first since 1972. West Bromwich’s victory last season was their first since 1978 and Everton had not managed it since 1992.\n\nThe old place just does not scare opponents in the way it once did and Southampton – this brilliant story that could go all the way to the Champions League – are the latest to find Manchester United’s faults.\n\nThey will cherish Dusan Tadic’s second-half goal, six minutes after arriving as a substitute, but this victory was also shaped by another demonstration of why Ronald Koeman’s side have the most parsimonious defence in the top division. In the process they replaced United in third position and their supporters filled the air with gloating cries of “where have all our players gone?” which seemed a satisfying response to the common suspicion that the club would nosedive after last summer’s exodus. New heroes have arrived. They came to Manchester, Koeman said, “not afraid of the name, not afraid of the stadium”.\n\nFor United, the sudden, damp silence at the end had the feel of a reality check. Louis van Gaal has been deluded recently to talk about United being genuine title contenders but it never seemed realistic and it should startle him that a team with Robin van Persie, Wayne Rooney, Ángel Di María and Juan Mata could be so ineffective.\n\nVan Gaal could not even find room in his squad for Radamel Falcao, opting instead to put the teenager James Wilson on the bench. Yet when Di María was substituted and Van Persie injured the player who was brought on to go into attack was Marouane Fellaini and it suddenly looked as though United were pinning their hopes on a high ball into the box.\n\nThis was the first time since 2009 they have not managed a shot on target in a home match and their points total is the same as it was under David Moyes at the same stage last season.\n\nVan Gaal tried his usual trick of rebounding any questions he did not like, in this case about the team’s progress, their defensive issues and general level of performance – yet they are relevant questions that deserve answers.\n\nThe worrying thing for the manager is that the lack of refinement has become a recurring theme. Yes, it was strange here to see a player of Di María’s gifts be so wasteful. Yet there is always apprehension inside Old Trafford whenever Phil Jones or Chris Smalling has to bring the ball out of defence and once again one saw the hard evidence that United have neglected this area of the team. Van Gaal will surely have noted the way Smalling charged out of defence in the moments preceding Tadic’s goal and the hole it left.\n\nTadic had replaced Eljero Elia after 63 minutes and it was a wonderful piece of vision from him to create the danger in the first place. It was the best pass of the game, leaving Graziano Pellè clear inside the penalty area and David de Gea badly exposed in the home goal. Pellè’s attempt came back off the post and Tadic kept his nerve to score with a controlled shot through a crowd of players.\n\nSouthampton had shown from the start they fancied their chances and were encouraged, perhaps, by a communication breakdown between Smalling and De Gea inside the opening minute. Shortly afterwards Nathaniel Clyne pinged a shot just wide and it had quickly become apparent that Southampton would play, as they have done virtually all season, with no sense of inferiority.\n\nFor the rest of the first half they did not pass the ball with enough creativity but the same applied to United for the entire match. Van Gaal was operating with his least orthodox system yet, a 3-3-2-2 wing-back formation with the fit-again Daley Blind among the centre-backs and Di María in attack with Van Persie – and Koeman said he had set out his team in the knowledge that United have “difficulties building up with three centre-halves”. Van Gaal, again, tried to deflect the question when it was put to him.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Louis van Gaal reflects on Manchester United’s defeat.\n\nWhat his team really lacked was penetration in attacking areas. Southampton had lost Toby Alderweireld to an early injury but Florin Gardos seamlessly filled the gap alongside José Fonte. Clyne excelled at right-back, as did Ryan Bertrand on the other side, and this quartet made a solid case for operating with a straightforward back four. Morgan Schneiderlin and Victor Wanyama provided an extra barrier in midfield and James Ward-Prowse stayed close to Michael Carrick to subdue the home side’s best passer.\n\nVan Gaal compared it to the corresponding fixture at St Mary’s when his team lacked any real spark but it has actually been the story for much of the season. Van Persie’s ankle injury meant Rooney left midfield to push further forward and Fellaini soon joined the attack. There were chances for an equaliser but the late onslaught that was once United’s speciality never materialised. They just are not that kind of team any more.\n\nMan of the match Victor Wanyama (Southampton)"}, {"date": "27/09/2014", "arena": "KCOM Stadium", "attendance": 22859, "home_team": {"name": "Hull City", "lineup": [{"name": "Allan McGregor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Liam Rosenior", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Dawson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Curtis Davies", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andrew Robertson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [83]}, {"name": "Ahmed Elmohamady", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mohamed Diamé", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Huddlestone", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jake Livermore", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [73]}, {"name": "Nikica Jelavic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Abel Hernandez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [32], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [74]}], "subs": [{"name": "Alex Bruce", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Chester", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robbie Brady", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [83], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steve Harper", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gaston Ramirez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [74], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stephen Quinn", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Hatem Ben Arfa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [73], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Manchester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Willy Caballero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pablo Zabaleta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Vincent Kompany", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eliaquim Mangala", "yellows": [31], "reds": [], "own_goals": [21], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gael Clichy", "yellows": [84], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Milner", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fernandinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [66]}, {"name": "Yaya Touré", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Silva", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [78]}, {"name": "Edin Dzeko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [11, 68], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sergio Agüero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [7], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [72]}], "subs": [{"name": "Joe Hart", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bacary Sagna", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aleksandar Kolarov", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jesus Navas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [66], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Frank Lampard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [87], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [72], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martín Demichelis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [78], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jose Pozo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "When it was all over, as Newcastle United briefly allowed themselves to bask in a pleasure that had been a long time coming, one moment stood out. There was bitterness and there was rancour. Yet the mutiny, for once, was not that of the fans in black and white. “Fuck off Sam Allardyce,” came the song from the away end. It was loud and jarring and that was the soundtrack that followed West Ham United’s manager out of the club.\n\n“You’re getting sacked in the morning,” also came down, unsparingly, from the most vertiginous part of the Leazes End. As it turned out, West Ham’s board could not even wait that long. His departure was confirmed within three minutes of the final whistle and his best attempts to put on a brave face, laughing his way through a series of awkward interviews, did not disguise the fact he must feel deeply chastened about the way it has unravelled. “I didn’t want to stay,” he said. “And I guess they could say they didn’t want me to stay anyway.”\n\nMutual consent or mutual contempt? All that can be said with certainty is that his team were generous opponents for a team with Newcastle’s needs. John Carver’s side have been English football’s Slapstick XI over the past few months. Yet they could not have picked a better side to play than West Ham. The home players held their nerve, dealt with the different emotions and pressures and it was strange, ultimately, that a day that had been preceded by much tension, with the heavy threat of relegation and potential devastation, became a relatively stress-free occasion.\n\nNewcastle would have been spared anyway because of Hull’s inability to beat Manchester United but Carver and his players have waited a long time to experience the explosion of joy that came at the end and, if nothing else, they deserved the crowd’s acclaim for dispelling the theory that it would be they who meekly waved a white flag. Yes, it was true that Allardyce’s players had sleepwalked through Allardyce’s final game. Yet Newcastle did play with a sense of togetherness that has not always been there in the Carver era and, in the process, they brought to an end a run of only one point out of the previous 10 games.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sam Allardyce comments on his time at the club and his plans now that he has been let go.\n\nThere was also a charming subplot attached to their day because of Jonás Gutiérrez’s contribution. Gutiérrez did not finish his chemotherapy for testicular cancer until November and the goal that extinguished any lingering relegation fears was his first since receiving the all-clear to resume his career. This was his last appearance for Newcastle because they have decided not to offer him a new contract now Mike Ashley is promising big-money arrivals to get the club – no sniggering, please – into the Champions League. For Gutiérrez, that late, deflected shot was some way to go and, for Newcastle, his victory run will be remembered as one of the most joyous moments of a bleak season.\n\nIt would be wrong, though, to say his goal was the all-important moment. Moussa Sissoko had put Newcastle ahead with a towering header nine minutes into the second half and there was never really any moment after that when West Ham seriously threatened to turn the game in their favour. Sissoko had shown considerably more determination than either Winston Reid or Aaron Cresswell to power in Gutiérrez’s left-wing cross and, as a snapshot of the game, that told a pretty accurate story.\n\nStewart Downing at least carried a flicker of menace during a prosaic opening half but Allardyce’s men have been in relegation form since Christmas and looked like a team in a hurry to reach their summer, officially. It was difficult to remember a more ineffectual strike partnership in the top division than Carlton Cole and Enner Valencia while, at the back, Cresswell seemed to have temporarily forgotten he is apparently West Ham’s player of the season.\n\nCarver was close to tears afterwards in what strayed towards an Oscars-style thank you speech and his personal sense of relief must have been immense given his long association with the club and all the disparagement that has come his way. Carver had instructed his players not to read the sports pages or tune into the football shows during the long build-up to this match because he feared they might be suffocated by anxiety.\n\nWhen the game started, it was also noticeable that he seldom left his dugout. The idea, again, was to spread a message of calm – or as near to it as possible – and it worked. Newcastle have rarely looked as composed during his brief tenure and could also look back on an extraordinary moment when Vurnon Anita and three of his team-mates ran from their own half in a four-on-one break. Anita’s attempt to lay the ball off was intercepted by the West Ham goalkeeper, Adrián, but Gutiérrez’s clinching goal quickly followed and Newcastle were safe.\n\nMan of the match Jonas Gutiérrez

rid of this unwanted knack of making life implausibly difficult for themselves but, plainly, that time is still some way off and for a long while here there was the very serious risk they might sieve away a two-goal lead for the second time in a week. This time, they held out but there were some hairy moments after Wayne Rooney’s sending off and it was a bittersweet occasion for the man Louis van Gaal had entrusted to be his captain.\n\nRooney really ought to have grown out of the sort of moments that led to him being shown a straight red card on the hour for a wild kick from behind on Stewart Downing and he was fortunate that West Ham did not take advantage. Sam Allardyce’s team certainly had enough of the ball to be aggrieved by the final score and it was an onslaught during those moments late on when Kevin Nolan was denied an equaliser by a wafer-thin offside decision.\n\nVan Gaal’s men did at least show a spirit of togetherness during those final exchanges and there was a wonderful clearing header from Paddy McNair on a day when the 19-year-old rookie, signed from Ballyclare Colts four years ago, appeared in a patched-up defence. Yet it was still startling to see how vulnerable they were, even before Rooney’s dismissal, bearing in mind they had led 2-0 by the midway point of the first half.\n\nIt was a desperate, nerve-shredding finale and Allardyce was engulfed in disappointment given the opposition’s defensive problems and the number of chances his team had accumulated, especially in that frantic last half an hour of almost unremitting pressure on David de Gea’s goal.\n\nAllardyce reserved most of his anger afterwards for the linesman, initially referring sarcastically to a “superman with X-ray vision” and a “super human being” before concluding that the official had “dropped a massive bollock”. Yet he was annoyed, too, about his team’s inability to make the most of their chances – “We fluffed them, we blew it” – and that really should have been the focus of his frustration. Allardyce had already been informed that Nolan’s head was marginally offside and that, really, is all that matters.\n\nWhat he could not explain was why his team had started so slowly when it might have been expected that they would quickly set about trying to get at the opposition’s new-look defence. Mark Noble’s absence through injury was a considerable setback but the home side had the longer list of absentees and West Ham were strangely subdued in an opening half an hour in which the home side attacked with speed and penetration.\n\nThe first goal came in the fifth minute when Rafael da Silva went haring along the right touchline and picked out Rooney’s run into the penalty area. Rooney took his shot first-time, clipping a wonderfully taken volley into the far corner, and the early goal seemed to settle any of the nerves that might have carried over from last weekend’s ordeal at Leicester City.\n\nThe second goal stemmed from Rooney and Ander Herrera pressurising Alex Song into losing possession inside his own half. Radamel Falcao played the pass into Van Persie and the Dutchman turned to make the shooting angle before delivering a precise right-footed finish just inside the post.\n\nIn different times, a visiting side to Old Trafford would have judged this as the point to focus on damage-limitation and avoid an old-fashioned thrashing. Yet the modern-day United now encourage opponents to think there are other ways. West Ham also had a clear height advantage. After 37 minutes, Downing put in a corner and De Gea – possibly impeded, according to Van Gaal - could not get a clean punch on the ball. Enner Valencia had the first effort and when the ball came back off the crossbar Diafra Sakho was first to the rebound to score with another header.\n\nVan Gaal had used an old Dutch phrase - “het lek boven krijgen” - in his programme notes. That, he explained, meant “finding the leak and fixing it”. Yet the goal invigorated West Ham and they were the better side at the start of the second half.\n\nPerhaps it was a growing sense of alarm that unnerved Rooney as West Ham broke from the edge of their own penalty area and he found himself in a straight chase with Downing. The winger had a head start and Rooney no longer has the pace of old. Losing the sprint, it was a reckless way to stop his opponent; unnecessary, too, given the location of the ball, 70 yards from De Gea’s penalty area. “Too unfriendly,” was as far as Van Gaal would go.

People were queuing up to write off Southampton after a summer in which they lost half a team and their manager, Mauricio Pochettino, but Ronald Koeman’s side are on a mission to make their critics think twice before being so premature in the future. Clubs in crisis are not supposed to be second in the Premier League, nor are they supposed to have strikers who can settle a match with an overhead kick of such brilliance and athleticism that it would not have made a difference if there had been two Robert Greens in goal for Queens Park Rangers.\n\nGraziano Pellè by name, Pelé by nature. Southampton were still reeling after Charlie Austin’s excellent volley for QPR had made it 1-1 when Shane Long, just on as a substitute, sent a tame cross to the far post from the right. Dusan Tadic, hoping to do no more than keep the move alive, headed the ball high in the air. Then Pellè, holding off Steven Caulker, controlled the ball. Then he contorted his body in a way that did not seem humanly possible. Then the ball was looping past a stunned Green and into the top-left corner. Then everyone in the stadium picked their jaws off the ground. “It will be one of the best goals of the season,” Koeman said.\n\nIt was a crushing blow for QPR yet although they could bemoan the quality of Pellè’s finish, Harry Redknapp’s side were not unlucky to lose, even though Niko Kranjcar almost rescued a point with a free-kick that struck the woodwork. “We kept going,” Redknapp said after a disappointing return to St Mary’s, but only because Southampton wasted so many chances.\n\nRedknapp is too long in the tooth to have been affected by the inevitable abuse from Southampton fans, who have not forgiven him for his part in their relegation in 2005 or his subsequent departure to Portsmouth. He took heart from QPR’s persistence and there were a few nervy moments for Southampton to endure at the end. Yet this was still another defeat on the road for QPR and secretly Redknapp must have been grateful that Southampton’s profligacy meant his side did not suffer as much as they did in the recent capitulations at Manchester United and Tottenham.\n\nSouthampton, whose players are enjoying life so much under Koeman that they gave up their day off after beating Arsenal in the Capital One Cup, tore into QPR from the start and the visitors’ cause was not helped when they lost Sandro in the 11th minute after a clash of heads with Sadio Mané. “The doctors now have to err on the side of caution,” Redknapp said.\n\nMané, making his league debut for Southampton, was a busy menace and Tadic, who hit the post, Pellè and Morgan Schneiderlin all wasted opportunities, while QPR did not threaten until first-half stoppage time, Austin drifting a shot wide.\n\nThat was a glimpse of the foolproof QPR plan: be terrible, lull Southampton into a sense of false security, pinch a goal. Yet the breakthrough finally arrived after 54 minutes when Mané’s glorious backheel found the onrushing Ryan Bertrand, who drilled a low shot underneath Green for his first Southampton goal.\n\nTadic and Victor Wanyama then went close to adding a second for Southampton, before QPR equalised when Austin showed outstanding technique to trap Eduardo Vargas’s cross, swivel and crash a volley past Fraser Forster.\n\nQPR thought they had got away with it.

season.\n\nAfter five draws in the opening six games, Gus Poyet is losing patience with certain individuals, and Jack Rodwell and Adam Johnson found themselves withdrawn on an afternoon when they and their team were not quite clever enough to undo an uncharacteristically stuttering Swansea.\n\nGarry Monk mentioned that the grass seemed “a bit long” and possibly hindered his side’s passing game. Although Poyet appeared slightly offended by that suggestion, Sunderland’s manager did concede that his tactics had “stopped Swansea from playing” in a match in which nothing much happened until an 11th-hour home onslaught following Àngel Rangel’s late dismissal.\n\n“It was scrappy, neither team really created anything, it was pretty much a nothing game” said Monk, whose puzzling decision to begin with Wilfried Bony, his most dangerous striker, on the bench arguably backfired. “We weren’t at our fluent best but we got the basics right.\n\n“We defended well. The pitch was difficult, the grass was left a little bit long and it was a bit soft and our passing never got going. But Sunderland didn’t really do anything much until the sending off.”\n\nIn the adjacent technical area, Poyet cut a somewhat harassed figure and early in the second half he replaced Rodwell with Jordi Gómez. Last week Sunderland’s manager had talked about “big players who cost a lot of money” needing to “step up” but Rodwell, a £10m former Manchester City midfielder, is yet to emerge as quite the colossus Wearsiders were hoping for.\n\nAlthough Bafétimbi Gomis remained isolated in Swansea’s attack so, too, did Connor Wickham in Sunderland’s and it was not long before Poyet sent on Ricardo Álvarez in place of Johnson. Like Rodwell, Johnson cost £10m from City and harbours hopes of rekindling his England career but, right now, if Roy Hodgson were to select a Sunderland player it would surely be Lee Cattermole.\n\nDespite Swansea dominating possession, Cattermole’s off-the-ball pressing helped explained why Monk was forced to frequently watch his players inter-passing in their own half.\n\nCattermole’s disciplinary record has improved of late but, even so, season-ticket holders feared a familiar script unfolding when he was booked for a bad tackle on Gylfi Sigurdsson.\n\nRangel, though, was also booked for kicking the ball away and, while Sunderland’s enforcer managed to mind his step, Swansea’s right back Rangel foolishly obstructed Will Buckley\n\nShortly before the flourishing of that second yellow card Wickham should have done better than head Sebastian Larsson’s inviting cross over the bar but at least their new-found numerical advantage increased Sunderland’s momentum.\n\nIn the final 10 minutes Poyet’s players bombarded Lukasz Fabianski’s box, yet with Steven Fletcher – on for Wickham – missing another excellent headed chance that first league win remained as elusive as ever."}, {"date": "27/09/2014", "arena": "Emirates Stadium", "attendance": 59900, "home_team": {"name": "Arsenal", "lineup": [{"name": "Wojciech

cupped his hand to his ear as he wheeled away in front of the Arsenal supporters. How about that then? What have you got now?\n\nArsenal did have an answer and it came in the form of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain’s clinically converted equaliser. The hosts had made the bulk of the attacking running, they had the majority of possession and chances, and it would have been galling for them had they been felled by Chadli’s sucker punch. The draw was the least that they deserved.\n\nThere was little relief for Arsenal, though, and plenty of regret. It was noticeable at full-time that a few of their players sank on to their haunches, their glaze fixed upon the turf while the visiting Tottenham fans clapped their , and Arsène Wenger articulated the frustration.\n\nThe Arsenal manager’s tetchy post-match mood was not helped by the muscular injuries that forced off Mikel Arteta and Aaron Ramsey in the first half. The midfielders, Wenger said, would miss the midweek Champions League home tie against Galatasaray and the trip to Chelsea on Sunday, with the fear being that they could prove longer-term casualties. Jack Wilshere also rolled his right ankle and is a fitness doubt.\n\nWenger’s gripe was with Tottenham for slowing down the game and, to paraphrase him, denying the paying punters a proper spectacle but, more specifically, it was with the referee, Michael Oliver, for his failure to take action against the time-wasting.\n\n“I would like, just once, to see the referee react against that,” Wenger said. “The referee is there to make sure the flow of the game is respected. It’s only a respect of the people who pay money to watch football. Book the goalkeeper straightaway when he walks to the other side to take a goal-kick. The next time, he will take it from where the ball is.”\n\nTottenham had a gameplan, which was to sit deep, stay compact and venture forward on the counter. And they stuck to it. Mauricio Pochettino, who started with Chadli pressed high up alongside Emmanuel Adebayor, made no apologies for the strategy and he praised his players for the hardiness of their mentality. Last season, he pointed out, Tottenham had lost in these sort of games. “It is a good point,” Pochettino said. “We have competed with a big team like Arsenal.”\n\nIt was the sort of game, Wenger said, that Arsenal would have won had not they given away a goal. But they did give away a goal. Having started the second half at great pace and with threat in the final third, they were unhinged when they tried to play out from the back.\n\nIt all looked a little tight when Per Mertesacker rolled the ball into the substitute, Mathieu Flamini, who was pounced upon by Christian Eriksen and dispossessed. The ball broke to Erik Lamela, he fed Chadli and the Belgian shot low into the far corner. He was booked for his celebration. Nobody in Tottenham colours cared.\n\nThis was an away performance built upon solid foundations. The central defenders, Younès Kaboul and Jan Vertonghen, were excellent and behind them, the goalkeeper, Hugo Lloris, was the man of the match. He made a handful of smart saves, with the best being that which repelled Mertesacker’s header in the 58th minute. What makes Lloris so impressive is how he makes the difficult things looks routine.\n\nAnother positive for Tottenham was the polished performance of Ryan Mason in central midfield. Pochettino had lost Mousa Dembélé to an ankle twist in training on Friday, but he had no hesitation in giving Mason his Premier League debut, despite the scale of the occasion. Apart from one poor cross when well-placed in the first half, the 23-year-old barely put a foot wrong.\n\nIt was a predictably spiky occasion, underscored by full-blooded commitment and yellow cards. Arteta and Ramsey felt calf and hamstring muscles twang, but Wilshere was caught by Danny Rose inside the area, before coming down on his ankle in grisly fashion. Wenger said that the incident ought to have led to an Arsenal penalty. Wilshere battled on; he would be withdrawn in the second half.\n\nTottenham invited Arsenal on to them and they looked to counter, particularly through the revitalised Lamela. He missed one simple pass in the first half, which would have got Tottenham in on goal, but his deft touch almost teed up Adebayor on 39 minutes. Chadli also shot weakly following Étienne Capoue’s through-ball.\n\nLloris clawed Oxlade-Chamberlain’s deflected cross to safety and he saved from Wilshere and Oxlade-Chamberlain, again, in the first half and he kept out Mesut Özil’s shot early in the second period.\n\nChadli’s goal raised the temperature further and Pochettino felt his temper boil over after a disputed throw-in.

It was difficult to think of anything other than the famous Sir Alex Ferguson quote to sum up an extraordinary match that delivered a famous Leicester City victory and ended with Manchester United making history for all the wrong reasons. This was the first time in 853 Premier League matches United have surrendered a two-goal lead and lost. Just let that statistic soak in for a minute.\n\nOnce upon a time United were famed for their own acts of escapology but nothing is quite how it used to be. There was something surreal about seeing United, from a position of total control when Ander Herrera made it 3-1 just before the hour mark, totally lose their way. United conceded four times in 21 chaotic second-half minutes on a day when a former non-league striker ran their defence ragged.\n\nJamie Vardy, who was playing for Stocksbridge Park Steels four years ago, in the eighth tier of English football, had the game of his life. The Leicester forward set up the first, won two penalties and scored the fourth. He even had a hand in Leicester’s other goal, when Dean Hammond’s shot struck him and bounced kindly for Esteban Cambiasso, on his first Premier League start, to make it 3-3. The Argentinian celebrated the goal as if it meant as much to him as any he scored for Internazionale.\n\nIn the eyes of the United players, Leicester’s first penalty, which was converted by David Nugent, was the turning point and should never have come about. Wayne Rooney was still protesting after the final whistle, the England captain furious Mark Clattenburg had penalised Rafael da Silva for a foul on Vardy, when the Leicester forward had barged into the United full-back seconds earlier.\n\nLouis van Gaal refused to point the finger at Clattenburg and instead blamed his players. Even if the penalty was soft, the United manager felt Da Silva was inviting trouble when he challenged Vardy in the area. Van Gaal also made the point that, with United still 3-2 ahead, his players had no reason to hit the panic button and should have been able to dominate possession and see out the game. That they were unable to do so against a promoted club rubbed salt into the wound.\n\nIt was, all in all, a chastening experience for United. By the time Leonardo Ulloa had made it 5-3 from the penalty spot, after Tyler Blackett was sent off for a professional foul on Vardy, the Leicester supporters were singing “we want six” and cheering every pass.\n\nAt that point Radamel Falcao and Ángel di María, who had executed a glorious chip to put United 2-0 ahead early on, were watching from the bench, after being withdrawn with the score at 3-3. As impressive as Falcao and Di María were at times as part of United’s galactico forward line, it still feels like a huge oversight that no one at Old Trafford thought to make strengthening central defence a priority when £150m was splurged in the summer.\n\nEnough of United’s shortcomings. Leicester deserve huge praise for having the fortitude to twice come back from two goals down. Nigel Pearson was bold enough to go man-for-man with United, with the Leicester manager opting for a midfield diamond in which the experienced Cambiasso sat at the base and showed some lovely touches. Further forward Vardy’s aggressive running caused United no end of problems, especially on the flanks, where neither Da Silva nor Marcos Rojo looked comfortable.\n\nNot that anyone could have predicted what would happen when United raced into a two-goal lead inside 16 minutes. Falcao, making his first start for United, created the first, expertly rolling Ritchie de Laet before delivering a perfect cross for Robin van Persie to head home, via a deflection off Liam Moore, at the far post. Three minutes later it was 2-0 when Di María exchanged passes with Rooney before delightfully lifting the ball over the stranded Kasper Schmeichel. Think Karel Poborsky at Euro 96.\n\nLeicester looked like they would be blown away by United’s firepower but, to their credit, they got back in the game straight from the kick-off. With Rojo caught on his heels, Vardy nipped in front of the left-back and got to the byline – the ball looked perilously close to being out – before digging out a superb cross for Ulloa to emphatically head home. Jonny Evans was caught in no man’s land, marking space, and limped off soon afterwards.\n\nFalcao hit the bar early in the second half before Herrera, showing a nice piece of improvisation, flicked Di Maria’s poorly hit shot past the wrong-footed Schmeichel. That should have been that but Nugent’s contentious penalty, followed by Cambiasso’s low left-footed shot, brought Leicester level within seven minutes.\n\nLeicester’s fourth arrived after Juan Mata, on for Di María, had his pocket picked inside his own half. De Laet fed Vardy, who had ocean’s of space to run into before calmly beating David de Gea. Ulloa’s penalty – his fifth goal in as many games – put a remarkable match beyond doubt.\n\n“When you’re 3-1 down against Manchester United, to win the game – regardless of how people want to view where they’re at at the moment – I think it’s a decent result,” Pearson said. “It says a lot about [the character]. And I think we’ve got a bit more quality than people are maybe aware of.”\n\nMan of the match Jamie Vardy (Leicester City)"}, {"date": "21/09/2014", "arena": "White Hart Lane", "attendance": 35861, "home_team": {"name": "Tottenham Hotspur", "lineup": [{"name": "Hugo Lloris", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eric Dier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Younes Kaboul", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Vlad Chiriches", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Rose", "yellows": [73], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Etienne Capoue", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [76]}, {"name": "Mousa Dembélé", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [61]}, {"name": "Erik Lamela", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Eriksen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nacer Chadli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [61]}, {"name": "Emmanuel Adebayor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Jan Vertonghen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Lennon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [76], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paulinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [61], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Roberto Soldado", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [61], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michel Vorm", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Naughton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nabil Bentaleb", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "West Bromwich Albion", "lineup": [{"name": "Ben Foster", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andre Wisdom", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Craig Dawson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joleon Lescott", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sébastien Pocognoli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Morrison", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [74], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Craig Gardner", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Graham Dorrans", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stéphane Sessegnon", "yellows": [83], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Chris Brunt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Saido Berahino", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Chris Baird", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Brown Ideye", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Anichebe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Boaz Myhill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cristian Gamboa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Youssouf Mulumbu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gareth McAuley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Mauricio Pochettino was supposed to eradicate White Hart Lane performances like this. Instead, the Tottenham Hotspur manager felt the gloom descend as his team stuttered to a flat and deserved defeat against a West Bromwich Albion team who had started the day at the foot of the Premier League table.\n\nThe sense of deja vu was uncomfortable, as Tottenham struggled to create against a well-drilled visiting team and it even took in Pochettino’s mannerisms in the technical area. He crouched on to his haunches like André Villas-Boas and at one point in the second half he hurled down a water bottle, Tim Sherwood-style.\n\nAt full-time, there were loud boos from the home support, who know that their next Premier League match is at Arsenal on Saturday, and bitter frustration behind the words of Pochettino. There was no rebound from the 3-0 defeat at the hands of Liverpool in the previous home game.\n\n“This is my surprise,” Pochettino said, when asked about his players’ lack of passion. “We need to show more. West Brom arrived with only two points but we need to show respect. We were wrong. I’m angry, disappointed. We had a bad day. The team looked very nervous. The way we played was wrong because we played very slow from the beginning.”\n\nThis was Albion’s first win at White Hart Lane in 30 years but, more importantly, it was a first in the Premier League under Alan Irvine. The goal came when James Morrison tip-toed on to Chris Brunt’s corner to head unmarked into Hugo Lloris’s net and begin an inquest among the Tottenham defence as to how such a diminutive midfielder might have done that. But it had been advertised.\n\nWhere Spurs lacked urgency, West Brom were slick and punchy. They created chances. Irvine could revel in a clutch of excellent performances, chiefly from Morrison, the striker Saido Berahino and the centre-halves Craig Dawson and Joleon Lescott. It was remarkable to think this was not only Lescott’s Albion debut but his first appearance of any description since March. But it was the collective organisation that stood out.\n\n“There was a moment in the first half when the atmosphere [among the home support] changed,” Irvine said. “We’d had a period of pressure and that can spread around the ground. We have experienced that at home and fans are going to respond to what they see. But I wouldn’t be critical of Tottenham fans. They’re a good group of fans.”\n\nIt was difficult to reconcile West Brom’s performance with their position in the table and they might have led sooner, having started brightly. Dawson looped an early header wide and he accidentally got in the way of a Lescott shot following a corner. Tottenham struggled throughout on Albion set pieces.\n\nCraig Gardner drew a smart save from Lloris after Morrison’s square ball and Berahino’s hard running worried the home defence. He had the ball in the net on 37 minutes only to be correctly flagged for offside.\n\nThankfully for Albion, the controversy of the match did not return to haunt them. Dawson’s flicked header from Morrison’s corner on the half-hour sent the ball into Emmanuel Adebayor’s outstretched hand and, if the Tottenham striker had little time to react, the hand was certainly a long way from being pinned to his side. The referee, Kevin Friend, was unmoved.\n\nThe Tottenham crowd had begun to chunter midway through the first half. There was sloppiness from their team, with Vlad Chiriches especially culpable and Pochettino could be seen demanding greater intensity. Chiriches was not the only substandard performer.\n\nErik Lamela showed quick feet and an eye for the dangerous cross but it was clear to every Tottenham fan that more was needed from the team. Their best moment of the first half stemmed from Christian Eriksen’s through-ball for Adebayor but Lescott did just enough to knock Adebayor from his stride. Adebayor was also inches from getting something on Eriksen’s whipped delivery from the left.\n\nTottenham faced a familiar problem – the need to unlock resolute opponents who carried a threat on the counter against the backdrop of a nervy atmosphere. Pochettino made attacking substitutions, introducing Roberto Soldado and Paulinho for the ineffective Nacer Chadli and Mousa Dembélé on the hour and switching to two up front while he brought on Aaron Lennon for Étienne Capoue.\n\nThe overall performance was laboured and, despite the best efforts of Lamela, lacking spark. Spurs’ only effort on target came in the 70th minute when Soldado worked Ben Foster at his near post.\n\nAlbion sat deeper in the second half but they carried a threat, particularly through Berahino, who almost beat Lloris with a swerving shot on 55 minutes. Morrison had also extended the goalkeeper before he found a way to the decisive moment. It was no more than he and Albion deserved.\n\nMan of the match Saido Berahino (West Brom)"}, {"date": "21/09/2014", "arena": "Goodison Park", "attendance": 37574, "home_team": {"name": "Everton", "lineup": [{"name": "Tim Howard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Stones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [64]}, {"name": "Phil Jagielka", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sylvain Distin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [84]}, {"name": "Leighton Baines", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [83], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James McCarthy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gareth Barry", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leon Osman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Atsu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [64]}, {"name": "Romelu Lukaku", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [9], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Samuel Eto'o", "yellows": [56], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Joel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Darron Gibson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [84], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aiden McGeady", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin Mirallas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [64], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Naismith", "yellows": [77], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [64], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Muhamed Besic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Antolin Alcaraz", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Crystal Palace", "lineup": [{"name": "Julian Speroni", "yellows": [89], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Kelly", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Scott Dann", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Damien Delaney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joel Ward", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James McArthur", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [84]}, {"name": "Mile Jedinak", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [30], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jason Puncheon", "yellows": [76], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Ledley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yannick Bolasie", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [69], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [87]}, {"name": "Fraizer Campbell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [54], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [86]}], "subs": [{"name": "Adrian Mariappa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adlene Guedioura", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [84], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin Doyle", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [86], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wilfried Zaha", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wayne Hennessey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dwight Gayle", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Zeki Fryers", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [87], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "A European hangover offered a convenient excuse for Everton’s second home defeat by Crystal Palace in five months but Roberto Martínez did not go there for good reason. It was nonsense. His team remain winless in the league at Goodison Park, and officially in the realm of a bad start to the season, because of another display strewn with basic defensive errors. A side with Everton’s ambition cannot afford such repetition.\n\nPalace triumphed 3-2 at Goodison in April during their escapology feat under Tony Pulis and repeated the act to give Neil Warnock his first win since returning to the club as manager. “A massive relief,” said Warnock, albeit he claimed a victory based on industry and resilient defending was richly deserved. It was an outcome few would have predicted as Everton dominated the opening 25 minutes with the confidence and fluency that characterised Thursday’s Europa League win over Wolfsburg.\n\nHowever, with Tim Howard gifting Palace their opening two goals in a match to forget for the goalkeeper, Leon Osman caught dawdling for the visitors’ third and his defence creaking under the slightest pressure, Martínez was left with familiar torment. “It is an incredible situation when you look at how solid we were against West Bromwich Albion last weekend and Wolfsburg,” said the Everton manager. “There is something spooky about the statistics. Three shots on target, three individual errors, three goals. It was a strange game. We were fantastic for the first 20 minutes and looked like we had seven days to prepare, not just a few.”\n\nRomelu Lukaku swept the home side ahead as James McCarthy, Everton’s best player, and Osman combined to send the Belgium international clear of the Palace defence for his second goal of the season. It should have been the foundation for an Everton side showing four changes to the Europa League game to flourish but, if anything, the opening proved too comfortable for Martínez’s team. Despite the luxury of an early goal and unthreatening opposition, Everton could not seize the opportunity to take control of the contest when it presented itself and paid with a second defeat in three home league games.\n\nEverton enjoyed 76% possession in the first half, comfortably contained the occasional counterattack from Yannick Bolasie and Jason Puncheon and almost doubled their advantage when Osman shot straight at Julián Speroni from Christian Atsu’s lay-off. Seconds later, a straightforward chance became a turning point when Palace were gifted an equaliser and valuable momentum. “We needed to kill the game in that period,”Martínez said. “If Leon scores the game is over.”\n\nThere appeared little danger when Bolasie’s flick-on landed between three Everton players inside the penalty area but, with John Stones waiting for Howard to collect and the goalkeeper hesitating, James McArthur was able to intercept. Palace’s record signing touched the ball a fraction before Howard and the referee Michael Oliver had no hesitation pointing to the spot when the USA international sent him sprawling. The captain Mile Jedinak sent an unstoppable spot-kick into the top corner.\n\nPalace were unfortunate not to take the lead before half-time when Bolasie’s long-range effort deflected off Stones and struck the crossbar with Howard stranded. It arrived shortly after the restart with another error from the Everton goalkeeper, so commanding against Wolfsburg but part of a creaking defence against Palace. The source was simple, a deep cross to the back post by the former Liverpool defender Martin Kelly, yet Howard was unable to claim under pressure from Fraizer Campbell and the ball struck the striker unwittingly on the back of the head and looped over Phil Jagielka on the line.\n\nMartínez replaced Stones and the ineffective Atsu with Kevin Mirallas and Steven Naismith in an attempt to inject some urgency and quality into the Everton attack but defensive errors continued to undermine their performance. With 20 minutes remaining Puncheon dispossessed Osman outside the home area and released Bolasie inside the area for an emphatic low finish into Howard’s far corner.\n\nPalace’s first league win of the season appeared assured but they had to survive a nervous finale when Scott Dann upended McCarthy in the box with eight minutes remaining and Leighton Baines converted the penalty. Lukaku almost levelled from a Mirallas cross in the final moments but Palace’s tireless defenders merited the reprieve.\n\n“We deserved to win it,” Warnock said. “We gave Everton too much respect at the start but I felt at half-time that if we were more confident on the ball we had the ammunition to hurt them on the counterattack. Every fixture in the Premier League is winnable.”\n\nMan of the match Yannick Bolasie (Crystal Palace)"}, {"date": "21/09/2014", "arena": "Etihad Stadium", "attendance": 45602, "home_team": {"name": "Manchester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Joe Hart", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pablo Zabaleta", "yellows": [32], "reds": [66], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Vincent Kompany", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eliaquim Mangala", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aleksandar Kolarov", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [78]}, {"name": "James Milner", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fernandinho", "yellows": [12], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [73]}, {"name": "Yaya Touré", "yellows": [44], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Silva", "yellows": [40], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Edin Dzeko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [70]}, {"name": "Sergio Agüero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Bacary Sagna", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [70], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Samir Nasri", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willy Caballero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jesus Navas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [73], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Frank Lampard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [85], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [78], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gael Clichy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martín Demichelis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Chelsea", "lineup": [{"name": "Thibaut Courtois", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Branislav Ivanovic", "yellows": [77], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gary Cahill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Terry", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "César Azpilicueta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cesc Fàbregas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nemanja Matic", "yellows": [39], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ramires", "yellows": [35], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [63]}, {"name": "Willian", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [63]}, {"name": "Eden Hazard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Diego Costa", "yellows": [66], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [86]}], "subs": [{"name": "Petr Cech", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Filipe Luis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Oscar", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Didier Drogba", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [86], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Mikel Obi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [63], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "André Schürrle", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [71], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [63], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Loïc Remy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "For a few seconds Frank Lampard looked almost overcome with awkwardness. He had been on the pitch seven minutes, making his first home appearance for Manchester City, when the ball came to him in the position that used to be his trademark for Chelsea, back in the days when he was establishing himself as the most prolific scorer there has ever been at Stamford Bridge.\n\nLampard struck his shot with the power and precision that has formed the stamp of his career, picking his spot to the right of Thibaut Courtois, and what a dramatic way to introduce himself to his new crowd, just as the match had been threatening to turn into an ordeal for the champions and Chelsea were close to extending their immaculate start to the season.\n\nUntil that moment it had been the away end serenading the former England international. Now it was the City supporters loudly proclaiming his name and, remarkably, Lampard might actually have gone on to win the match. With the clock ticking down, the next chance that came his way enticed more memories of all those times when he had scored vital goals from the edge of the penalty area. This time his shot came back off his old mate, John Terry, prostrate on the turf, and Lampard was spared any more of the post-match apologies that began with his slightly contrite wave to the away fans after the final whistle.\n\nIt was a dramatic finale out of keeping with the rest of the match and City, a man down after Pablo Zabaleta’s red card, ought to feel immense relief bearing in mind the eight-point gap that was threatening to open up between the sides. They did show great resilience but from José Mourinho’s perspective he will regard it as unusual carelessness not to have held on against 10 men.\n\nAt 1-0 it had looked for all the world as if City were going to suffer again at the hands of Mourinho’s tactical nous, with more than a sprinkling of deja vu from when the two sides met here last season. Again, it was a match of few chances, with Chelsea defending in numbers, displaying all their qualities of structure and organisation. Courtois had been just as redundant as Petr Cech in the corresponding fixture in February and it was only five minutes after Zabaleta’s sending-off that Eden Hazard put the ball across the six-yard area for the substitute André Schürrle to slide in and open the scoring at the far post.\n\nThat would usually have been the position for Zabaleta to guard and he, more than anyone, owes Lampard a debt of gratitude. Zabaleta is a hero in these parts, afforded a standing ovation as he left the pitch, but the cries of “one-nil to the referee” felt like a crowd looking for an excuse that was not really there.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest José Mourinho and Manuel Pellegrini are both happy to settle for a point following Man City’s 1-1 draw with Chelsea\n\nMike Dean had an erratic afternoon but a player of Zabaleta’s experience, already booked for bringing down Hazard, really ought to have known better than to go in from behind on Diego Costa twice in succession. His first was risky enough but the second connected with Costa’s calf and Chelsea’s new signing is not the kind of man who accepts those indignations easily. His reaction inflamed the situation and quite possibly that was deliberate on his part. The bottom line, however, is Zabaleta put his team at risk.\n\nAs tends to happen when Mourinho comes up against Manuel Pellegrini, the game was followed by a lack of pleasantries, with Chelsea’s manager resorting to his old trick of getting an opponent’s name wrong, in this case “Mr Pellegrino”. Mourinho’s real beef, however, was almost certainly about the way his team surrendered a winning position. Costa struck the post when he had a chance to make it 2-0 after 81 minutes and by that point City had been restricted to only a couple of opportunities.\n\nThe game had been largely devoid of penalty-box drama yet it was still a captivating spectacle seeing these two heavyweights of the modern game slugging it out. It was an epic tussle, epitomised by that little cameo in the first half when Vincent Kompany and Costa went for the same ball, holding their ground like two warring old stags.\n\nThey did not give an inch before Kompany finally emerged with the ball and it was that kind of brute strength and raw determination that marked out the contest rather than the occasional moments of skill.\n\nBy half-time there had been six bookings and two of the players on yellow cards, Fernandinho and David Silva, could conceivably have been sent off. It was a contest for midfield supremacy and that might not have made it gripping in an orthodox sense but the various duels – Yaya Touré versus Nemanja Matic, Fernandinho against Willian, James Milner versus César Azpilicueta – still held the crowd’s attention. At one end John Terry and Gary Cahill created a formidable barrier for Edin Dzeko and the strangely subdued Sergio Agüero to pass. At the other end Kompany was immense and Eliaquim Mangala can be encouraged by his debut.\n\nCity had been on the verge of their first back-to-back home matches without a league goal since November 2010 when Milner turned the ball into Lampard’s path and nobody really should have been too surprised by his absence of celebration.\n\nMan of the match Fernandinho (Manchester City)"}, {"date":

chances are Harry Redknapp is its founder, president and lifetime member. Here the Croat showed why the QPR manager admires him so much. Kranjcar sparkled before rescuing a point with an exquisite free-kick two minutes from time, leaving the home crowd grateful that Redknapp persuaded the player to come here on transfer deadline day, the fourth time he has signed Kranjcar.\n\nThe fondness seems to be mutual, as Kranjcar apparently turned his back on a fortune in order to join QPR from Dynamo Kyiv, the conflict in Ukraine perhaps a push factor to complement the pull of Redknapp. “We pay a third of what he was being paid in Ukraine and [Kyiv] don’t pay any of it. So he took a massive cut to come here, that’s how much he wanted to come back.”\n\nKranjcar’s goal was the ideal way for him to avenge the fouls that he suffered at the boots of Ryan Shawcross and Steve Sidwell towards the end of the match. Until then it had looked like Mark Hughes would be the man gaining retribution. The Welshman was booed by a smattering of home fans on his first return to Loftus Road since being sacked as QPR manager nearly two years ago but most locals seemed to confine themselves to hoping that their current team would provide comment on Hughes’s reign by demonstrating that the club is now much better off than when he left. That should not have been hard given that QPR were bottom of the Premier League back then with four points from 12 matches, but Redknapp’s men have made an unconvincing start to this season and were woeful for long periods here.\n\nStoke helped themselves to the lead in the 11th minute, when Victor Moses ambled down the left and lobbed the ball towards the unmissable Peter Crouch, who headed down for Mame Biram Diouf to nod in from close range.\n\nMoses could have scored again one minute later but fired straight at Rob Green from the edge of the area. QPR were looking stodgy in midfield, dodgy at the back and devoid of ideas going forward. There seemed little prospect of them being able to pick a way through a defence that had shut out Manchester City on their last away trip.\n\nDiouf twice dallied when given chances to increase his team’s tally on the counterattack, before Crouch slashed wide from 18 yards in the 31st minute.\n\nKranjcar went close with a swirling long-rangeshot before playing a key role as the home side got the break they badly needed. He swung a corner towards the back post, Steven Caulker met it and Crouch and Charlie Adam confused each other as they tried to clear and ended up helping the ball across the line.\n\nThe hosts were soon behind again, and once more it was all too easy for Stoke. Moses shrugged off Mauricio Isla down the left and sent a low cross into the area. Somehow it ran past Caulker and Ferdinand and all the way to Crouch, who smashed it into the net from 10 yards.\n\nErik Pieters and Steven N’Zonzi missed further chances to deepen QPR’s problems. Stoke did not look in jeopardy until Sidwell clattered Kranjcar and the Croat curled the free-kick into the net.\n\n“QPR looked a beaten team but unfortunately we encouraged them somewhat,” said Hughes. “When you give a player of that ability a chance centrally, there’s always a danger he will score.”"}, {"date": "20/09/2014", "arena": "Villa Park", "attendance": 40013, "home_team": {"name":

They came out of it chastened, their presumption mercilessly exposed, grateful only that they had not been asked to play against Borussia Dortmund.\n\nSo comprehensively outplayed in midweek, a transformed Arsenal indulged in a little bullying of their own to put Villa’s best Premier League start for 16 years into perspective. The record books will show that three first-half goals in the space of just over three minutes put the game beyond the home side’s reach, and that would have been remarkable enough after an evenly matched first half-hour that produced little goalmouth incident.\n\nArsenal’s ambush was even more stealthily surprising than that. Two goals in two minutes ended the contest with an hour still to play, stunning the home crowd into silence as much through the identity of the scorers as the precision of their finishing.\n\nMesut Özil practically invites criticism, and has been getting it in spades since the Dortmund defeat, through not even appearing interested in his team’s fortunes or his personal contribution. Gunners fans have been imploring Arsène Wenger to drop him, and the manager must have been tempted, yet not only did he leave him in the team and give Alexis Sánchez a rest he played him in his favoured No10 position and was handsomely rewarded. First by Ozil’s cool finish for his first Arsenal goal of the season, gliding on to Danny Welbeck’s through ball and calmly slotting past Brad Guzan, then by his next involvement in the game when he turned up on the left to create the second goal.\n\nThis time it was Welbeck’s turn to answer criticisms of his strike rate with his first Arsenal goal. Having played the ball out to Özil on the left he galloped forward and had no trouble supplying a first-time finish to a return pass in exactly the area he wanted it.\n\nArsenal had barely paused for breath between the two goals, Villa had barely touched the ball, and Özil and Welbeck’s reputations had been restored as rapidly as the home sides hopes had been extinguished.\n\nSmall wonder Villa leaked another goal within a couple of minutes, Aly Cissokho turning Kieran Gibbs’s low cross from the left into his own net. Perhaps Villa were undermanned at the back – Ron Vlaar was unavailable again with a calf injury and Nathan Baker, outstanding at Anfield a week ago, was one of several home players to fall victim to a virus – yet that should not detract from the quality of the first two Arsenal goals.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Arsène Wenger and Paul Lambert reflect on Arsenal’s 3-0 win\n\n“Arsenal were clinical, but without making excuses we had had so much bad luck this week it’s not true,” said Paul Lambert, who has just signed a new contract as Villa manager. “There’s a virus going round that affected a lot of the players before and during the match. It’s disappointing, but there’s no point being down about it, you just have to take your medicine.\n\n“We could have gone top of the league with a win, but 10 points from five games is still a good return.”\n\nAlmost inevitably the rest of the afternoon was an anticlimax after such a flurry of excitement, settling back into the evenly contested ordinariness it had exhibited before Arsenal showed their ruthless streak.\n\nWhile the game remained scoreless Ciaran Clark came closest to breaking the deadlock, finding space at the far post to meet an expertly delivered Tom Cleverley free-kick only for Wojciech Szczesny to spread himself and keep the header out. Cleverley’s delivery from dead balls, indeed his general display, was one of the few positives Villa could take out of the game. The loan signing from Manchester United found Clark again with a second-half corner, yet just as the defender lined up a shot with the goal at his mercy Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain threw himself at the ball to block.\n\nVilla gave up the chase as Arsenal passed the ball around unhurriedly for the rest of the second half, with Özil occasionally dropping back as deep as his own half in search of the ball and once or twice even attempting a tackle. Perhaps pointedly, Wenger left him on the field when making a triple substitution 12 minutes from the end.\n\nRidiculously, that short space of time was enough for Jack Wilshere to get himself booked, but that scarcely cast a shadow on Arsenal’s afternoon. It had finally proved one of Özil’s better days, and quite a relief for his manager too. “He prefers to play in the middle, and he responded very well,” Wenger said. “But it is not always easy to strike the right balance. I can find you 10 other players in my squad who want to play the same role.”"}, {"date": "20/09/2014", "arena": "Turf Moor", "attendance": 20026, "home_team": {"name": "Burnley", "lineup": [{"name": "Tom Heaton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kieran Trippier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Duff", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jason Shackell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Mee", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Scott Arfield", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Jones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [86]}, {"name": "Dean Marney", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "George Boyd", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Lukas Jutkiewicz", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marvin Sordell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [63]}], "subs": [{"name": "Ross Wallace", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [86], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Kightly", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Reid", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matthew Gilks", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stephen Ward", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Keane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Barnes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [63], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Sunderland", "lineup": [{"name": "Vito Mannone", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Santiago Vergini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John O'Shea", "yellows": [78], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wes Brown", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Patrick van Aanholt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lee Cattermole", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sebastian Larsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [67]}, {"name": "Jack Rodwell", "yellows": [62], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Emanuele Giaccherini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [73]}, {"name": "Adam Johnson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [67]}, {"name": "Connor Wickham", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Costel Pantilimon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Billy Jones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Liam Bridcutt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordi Gomez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [67], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jozy Altidore", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [67], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Graham", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Will Buckley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [73], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "At some point this season, Burnley and Sunderland will win a league game. But not just yet, and possibly not for a while. In the meantime, they conjured one of the most predictable scorelines of the season. Burnley cannot score and are increasingly solid defensively. Sunderland are the division’s draw specialists.\n\nThe points were duly shared, to neither delight nor dismay. Indeed, until the woodwork was rattled twice in the closing minutes, there was an air of inevitability about the stalemate.\n\nEven then, the drama was deceptive. Ashley Barnes’s effort acquired an added menace courtesy of a deflection off Lee Cattermole, redirecting it on to the bar. The hosts’ goalkeeper, Tom Heaton, then tipped an added-time thunderbolt from the Sunderland left-back Patrick van Aanholt on to the post.\n\nThe Sunderland manager was nevertheless nonplussed. “I was expecting more than that,” said Gus Poyet. “Everything we planned didn’t really go as we would like. We played OK but okay is not enough in the Premier League. We need to play better than OK.”\n\nSo it was an outcome to satisfy statisticians, if few others. Burnley recorded a third successive clean sheet in the top flight for the first time since 1968. However, their goal drought, dating back to Scott Arfield’s spectacular opener against Chelsea, now extends to 526 minutes. If they rarely looked like ending it, perhaps sympathy should be extended to the parched Clarets.\n\nWhile Liverpool are experiencing life without the sold Luis Suárez and the sidelined Daniel Sturridge, Burnley find themselves in a similar predicament. They, too, had two strikers who reached the 20-goal landmark last season. Now neither is available, with Sam Vokes recovering from cruciate ligament surgery and Danny Ings hamstrung. They were ill-timed injuries. Burnley’s first two home games were against Chelsea and Manchester United and if this represented the first truly winnable match on home soil, Sean Dyche’s side required a cutting edge. Instead, they had a blunt attack.\n\n“I am not naive,” Dyche said. “I know you have to score goals to win games but our performance levels are very good. We probably edged it.”\n\nHe took solace from Burnley’s infectious commitment. “If we keep playing like that I am absolutely convinced wins are around the corner,” Dyche said.\n\nIngs’s replacement Marvin Sordell had an immediate opportunity to mark his first Premier League start by ensuring the absent forwards weren’t missed. Sadly for him, he squandered it, scuffing his shot wide.\n\nHis strike partner, Lukas Jutkiewicz, showed a Stakhanovite work ethic and Dyche felt his side merited a penalty when Emanuele Giaccherini challenged the former Middlesbrough man, but Burnley only truly threatened when Arfield, their sole scorer this season, almost caught Vito Mannone out at his near post and Barnes nearly scored in fortunate fashion. But Burnley ended as they started, playing at a high tempo.\n\nSunderland’s performance was more fitful. There were glimpses of quality from Adam Johnson and Giaccherini, particularly when they combined and the Italian centred, aiming to give Connor Wickham a tap-in. The Burnley captain, Jason Shackell, made a goal-saving interception.\n\nVan Aanholt then struck the post but it wasn’t enough to placate Poyet. “I wanted to control the game more, to be in better positions and create better chances,” he said. “It was a big opportunity to take three points and we missed it.”\n\nNor did the travelling fans depart satisfied. They spent much of the second half calling for Alan Pardew to remain Newcastle manager. They fell silent when news of their rivals’ comeback at St James’ Park filtered throughand while Sunderland may be stable and Newcastle embroiled in crisis, they are separated by a point."}, {"date":

and was standing on the touchline seemingly muttering a little prayer when Hull City scored their second goal.\n\nUntil then, the atmosphere inside the stadium had been surprisingly tepid. Far tamer than expected, the anti-Alan Pardew protests hyped up on social media all week proved half-hearted and almost apologetic.\n\nSuddenly, though, a largely neutral mood threatened to turn ugly. High in the stands Mike Ashley, Newcastle’s owner, folded his arms and Pardew’s body language appeared edgy.\n\nCometh the hour, cometh the man. When Cissé fractured a kneecap in April he was set to be sidelined until Christmas, and the Senegal striker returned to training only on Monday. When Pardew told his medical staff he would be on the bench they were deeply unhappy, but ultimately overruled. As Cissé stripped for action, heads were shaken. It seemed not so much a high-stakes gamble, as a manager possibly playing his final, desperate, card. But substitutions can rarely have proved as transformative.\n\nIt did not take long for the supposed convalescent to score twice, thereby not only diluting the disgruntlement festering beneath the game’s surface but earning a previously unlikely point. Granted, Newcastle still seek their first Premier League win of the season, but the No9’s intervention may well have been enough to preserve his manager’s job.\n\nA rather odd afternoon began with a group of Newcastle fans applauding Steve Bruce as the visiting manager entered the ground’s main reception. As displays of disloyalty go, serenading a rival manager takes some beating but the atmosphere inside the stadium proved somewhat less mutinous.\n\nAdmittedly there were odd chants of “We want Pardew out” and some jeering when he trapped a loose ball, but it was all kindergarten stuff. Certainly the Tyneside air was much less toxic than when Newcastle’s manager endured wholesale abuse during a 3-0 win against Cardiff here at the end of last season. Only one “Sack Pardew” banner was visible.\n\nThe Jonás Gutiérrez factor perhaps contributed to this slightly uneasy calm. In a bid to bolster the morale of their left-winger, who is receiving treatment for testicular cancer in Argentina, Newcastle’s players ran out wearing identical over-shirts all bearing the number 18 and the name Jonás.\n\nThe crowd responded with their own tribute in the form of sustained clapping in the 18th minute. Sixty seconds earlier there had been more of the same – this time in recognition of John Alder and Liam Sweeney, the two Newcastle fans who died when flight MH17 was shot down.\n\nAgainst such a backdrop there were clearly a few pricked consciences, a few mixed feelings about the ethics and perceived pettiness of attempting to engineer the manager’s ousting.\n\nMoreover, Newcastle were actually playing quite well. True, many Tynesiders would have much preferred Hatem Ben Arfa to be wearing black and white on the pitch rather than signing autographs in the posh seats (controversially loaned to Hull by Pardew, he was ineligible to play), but Cheik Tioté, Rémy Cabella and Fabricio Coloccini were all impressing.\n\nTioté, particularly, was excellent, the defensive midfielder’s outstanding performance probably succeeding in turning a few cynics into cheerleaders.\n\nNewcastle were clearly the better side, but had problems in the final third where, despite Cabella’s clever prompting, Emmanuel Rivière, Pardew’s lone striker, rarely troubled Allan McGregor.\n\nThis was far from a vintage Hull performance – although Andrew Robertson shone at left-back, provoking all sorts of danger on speedy overlaps – but Bruce seemed happy enough with his team’s containment policy, and, sure enough, their patient approach was rewarded with an opportunistic goal early in the second half.\n\nWhen Jack Colback lingered in possession, Mohamed Diamé stole the ball before backheeling to Ahmed Elmohamady, whose cross brought out the very best in Nikica Jelavic. The striker’s sublime volleyed scissor kick was far too good for Tim Krul and as virtually every other Hull outfield player leapt on Jelavic in delight, Ashley received some advice.\n\n“We want Pardew out,” sang the St James’ choir, rather more loudly than before. Even so, the subsequent refrains of “Sacked in the morning” soon faded and died. There was to be no outright anarchy in the stands - or at least not yet.\n\nEven so Newcastle’s manager looked relieved when Jelavic touched a free-kick to Huddlestone. His shot rebounded off the wall, falling at the feet of Stephen Quinn who, unmarked, missed from six yards.\n\nIt was to be a mere stay of execution as when, of all people, Tioté conceded possession and Diamé took full advantage, turning Daryl Janmaat before crashing a stupendous, swerving shot past Krul.\n\nOn came Cissé and everything changed. Stephen Quinn erred and, atoning for his earlier mistake, Tioté played in the No9, who unleashed a low shot which, squeezed just inside a post, punished McGregor.\n\nBruce switched from 4-4-2 to 3-5-2 and Cissé sensed further opportunity. When Yoan Gouffran headed Moussa Sissoko’s cross back into the area, the unattended striker lashed the ball past McGregor.

The Southampton manager said: “We had to be patient to create a possibility, but we scored a great goal and that was enough for three points. We didn’t create a lot but we had a lot of pressure and if you keep patient then you think you will score. I said at half-time the worst was 0-0 and I told the players to wait for the real moments to create. We didn’t do it that often but we did one or two times and it was enough.”\n\nKoeman felt Bony’s first yellow card was harsh but said the striker could have no dispute with the second caution and the award of a red card.\n\n“Maybe the first one he didn’t exactly mean to make that fall and was maybe a bit unlucky,” the Dutchman said. “But the second one is definitely a yellow card.\n\n“It was a tough game against a strong Swansea side.\n\n“It’s nice for the fans who love the Saints to see us in second place but as technical staff we must keep quiet. It is a fantastic start for us but it is no time to celebrate.”"}, {"date": "20/09/2014", "arena": "Upton Park", "attendance": 34977, "home_team": {"name": "West Ham United", "lineup": [{"name": "Adrián", "yellows": [17], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Guy Demel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [61]}, {"name": "James Tomkins", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Winston Reid", "yellows": [4], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [2], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Cresswell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mark Noble", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cheikhou Kouyaté", "yellows": [28], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex Song", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [69]}, {"name": "Stewart Downing", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Diafra Sakho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [7], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Enner Valencia", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [76]}], "subs": [{"name": "Mauro Zárate", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ricardo Vaz Te", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Carl Jenkinson", "yellows": [66], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [61], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Collins", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [76], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Morgan Amalfitano", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [88], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [69], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jussi Jaaskelainen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Carlton Cole", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Liverpool", "lineup": [{"name": "Simon Mignolet", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Javi Manquillo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [22]}, {"name": "Martin Skrtel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dejan Lovren", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alberto Moreno", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Gerrard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lucas Leiva", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Jordan Henderson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Raheem Sterling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [26], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fabio Borini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [75]}, {"name": "Mario Balotelli", "yellows": [17], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Brad Jones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jose Enrique", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kolo Touré", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rickie Lambert", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [75], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mamadou Sakho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [22], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Lallana", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lazar Markovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Liverpool always knew they would face a period of adjustment this term, though they could not have envisaged it proving quite this painful. A third league defeat in four games has left them stewing well off the early pace, this game surrendered in its frenetic first seven minutes when West Ham United were rampant and the visitors merely dazed and confused.\n\nThe blur of tactical tweaks and substitutions thereafter hinted at a riposte for a while but Liverpool never struck upon the correct blend. In truth, if this revamped squad are still becoming accustomed to each other’s foibles then the actual team’s constant shape-shifting even within games can leave them looking dizzied at times. A troubling injury list, the raised expectations from last term, a more onerous schedule incorporating Champions League football and the disruption caused by Luis Suárez’s departure are all mitigating circumstances of sorts, but here they were eclipsed by West Ham’s energy.\n\nIt had been at its most devastating in the opening seven minutes, but it was retained to the final exchanges on the counterattack. The final whistle was beckoning when Mamadou Sakho stretched and misdirected a header back in-field for the excellent Stewart Downing to collect. His pass inside Steven Gerrard’s lunge and out of reach of Martin Skrtel was perfect for Morgan Amalfitano, whose crisp first-time finish across Simon Mignolet confirmed the hosts’ deserved success. It was December before Brendan Rodgers’ side lost a third league game last term. Life is proving far more sobering this time.\n\nThere is uncertainty in virtually all their play at present, with the forward line still seeking to tap in to Mario Balotelli’s qualities in the absence of both Suárez and the injured Daniel Sturridge, their midfield too often overrun and the defence still rather makeshift in its composition. Goals are even being shipped at set pieces these days, a reflection that the clear physical presence they possess across their back line is not providing authority in the air. The manner in which James Tomkins was able to amble away from the ponderous Skrtel and above Jordan Henderson to nod Downing’s free-kick back across goal 80 seconds in summed that up, with Winston Reid bundling the loose ball through Dejan Lovren on the line.\n\nThat was the first reward of a frantic start, a goal to settle the home side’s nerves given they have choked regularly in this arena in recent times with only two previous victories since February, and West Ham duly threatened to run riot. Their ascendance was established in the centre, where Alex Song and Cheikhou Kouyaté provided the muscle to complement Mark Noble’s busy industry. Downing operated at the tip of their diamond, looking every bit the player Liverpool had once considered worth £20m when prising him from Aston Villa, while Enner Valencia and Diafra Sakho split, galloped into the channels and stretched frazzled opponents. The latter’s second was glorious, a delicate and deliberate chip arcing over Mignolet after Alberto Moreno had failed to summon a challenge.\n\nEarly indications are that West Ham have struck gold in the market this summer, with Allardyce even suggesting this team are “capable of going as far” as his Bolton side who regularly competed for European football. “Diafra’s come in a bit under the radar because Enner Valencia had such a fantastic World Cup,” he said. “But he scored 20 goals to help Metz win the French second division last year. The energy they’ve got, in and out of possession, terrorised their back four today. Kouyaté loves life, loves football, loves being in every day and he looks like being a fine players for us. We have nine new players, it’s early in the season, and yet they’ve hit the ground running and are performing very well at this level.”\n\nAdaptation is proving more problematic for Liverpool’s numerous new personnel, with the team’s early lethargy in the face of such urgent West Ham pressing costing them dear. There was to be no prolonged recovery. The menacing Raheem Sterling, the only visiting forward to offer a display worthy of his reputation, had thrashed in from the edge of the area after Aaron Cresswell blocked Balotelli’s attempt. But, having reverted to a back three and then introduced Adam Lallana at the interval to flood midfield, Liverpool could find no way through.\n\nThe nearest they came were a Balotelli snapshot and a close-range Mamadou Sakho header but West Ham would not wilt. Amalfitano’s late reward confirmed only the London club’s third win in 23 league meetings with Liverpool. “We know we weren’t at our level,” said Rodgers. “We know we have to do better.\n\n“We were brilliant last season. But I would say that, at this point last season, we weren’t playing to the level we were in the last three or four months of the campaign. People were asking me whether we’d score enough and we finished the season with 101 goals. We’ve got a bit of work to do, we know we weren’t at our level. We’ll go away and reflect honestly, and we know we have to be better.”\n\nMiddlesbrough await in the Capital One Cup on Tuesday before Saturday’s Merseyside derby offers another daunting test. There is no time for Liverpool to catch their breath at present.

"report": "Enner Valencia provided stunning evidence that West Ham’s evolution may be worth watching with an early contender for goal of the season in a match that kicked stereotypes into touch.\n\nValencia, £12m worth of Ecuador striker, marked his first Premier League start with a Tony Yeboah-esque equaliser and came within an inch or two of a last-gasp winner as these sides ditched defensive solidity for more expansive approaches. His 25-yarder was sandwiched by classy finishes from Hull’s debutants Abel Hernández and Mohamed Diamé before a howler from the goalkeeper Allan McGregor resulted in a Curtis Davies own goal.\n\nWho knew Monday nights in East Yorkshire could be such fun? “We are not supposed to be playing like that,” said Hull's manager, Steve Bruce, before heading off for a beer with his counterpart Sam Allardyce. “We don’t normally play diamonds, we buy diamonds for people’s fingers,” he joked of the formations.\n\nOn this evidence both teams need tightening at the back. Allardyce, although enthused by the attacking threat of a side he laced with three forwards, was left to bemoan the sacrifice of one part of his side’s game for the promotion of another. “Attractive football and no wins is no good to me, no good to the owners and no good to the supporters,” he said.\n\nLet us hope it takes a while for both to work in unison. Here, West Ham’s more-open approach allowed Hull to go ahead when their record £10m signing Hernández elegantly stole in front of James Tomkins to powerfully head them into a 39th-minute lead. It was so nearly 2-0 before the interval but Hernández’s dipping effort from outside the area struck the underside of the bar and his fellow striker Nikica Jelavic was flagged offside as he nodded the rebound into an empty net.\n\nHernández, the understudy to Luis Suárez and Edinson Cavani with Uruguay, received a standing ovation at the interval but another performer from this past summer’s World Cup altered the mood within the KC Stadium. Valencia teased Michael Dawson with his fleet of foot and, having a bought a yard, lashed in from distance. “The power and accuracy of the shot meant it was past McGregor before he could move,” said Allardyce. “It’s one of the best goals you’ll see.”\n\nIn a flash Valencia had countered Hull’s momentum but he spurned the opportunity to turn the contest on its head shortly afterwards when he failed to connect with Winston Reid’s goalward header, unmarked and six yards out. With seconds left he had a chance even closer to the line but his header found its way over via a combination of Dawson’s chest and crossbar. It led Bruce – who admitted surprise at West Ham’s authentic 4-3-3 formation – to confess: “When I look back at this I will probably see it as a point gained.”\n\nAllardyce, having seen one of Hull’s recent acquisitions pay an immediate dividend on a transfer-deadline investment, feared he was about to be left to rue another when Diamé, whom he sold to Hull for £3.5m, put the home team back in front. Diamé mugged his replacement in West Ham’s midfield, Cheikhou Kouyaté, in a central area, advanced into the area and scored off the inside of a post. “What sickened me most was that we gifted it to him,” said Allardyce, who witnessed even greater generosity on Hull’s part within two minutes.\n\nDiafra Sakho’s cross-shot lacked power but somehow squirmed from the grasp of the Scotland international McGregor and bobbled off Curtis Davies’s heel into the net.\n\n“If we had just been able to hold on to the lead for 10 minutes it might have been a different story,” said Bruce, who withdrew his two goalscorers for his two creative loanees Gastón Ramírez and Hatem Ben Arfa with 11 minutes to go.\n\nSuch was the enthralling nature of the contest that Assem Allam’s recent reiteration of his desire to re-brand to Hull Tigers barely caused a ripple. Only when the match lulled in about the 20th minute were the “City Til I Die” chants in evidence.\n\nThey were met with boos from other areas of the home support.\n\nThings are slowly changing in these parts."}, {"date": "14/09/2014", "arena": "Old Trafford", "attendance": 75355, "home_team": {"name": "Manchester United", "lineup": [{"name": "David De Gea", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rafael", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [67]}, {"name": "Jonny Evans", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tyler Blackett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marcos Rojo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daley Blind", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ander Herrera", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [36], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ángel di María", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [24], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [82]}, {"name": "Juan Mata", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [58], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [67]}, {"name": "Wayne Rooney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [44], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robin van Persie", "yellows": [33], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Luke Shaw", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Falcao", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [67], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adnan Januzaj", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [82], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Anders Lindegaard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Darren Fletcher", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Antonio Valencia", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [67], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andreas Pereira", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Queens Park Rangers", "lineup": [{"name": "Robert Green", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mauricio Isla", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rio Ferdinand", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Caulker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Clint Hill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Junior Hoilett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leroy Fer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sandro", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [74]}, {"name": "Niko Kranjcar", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matt Phillips", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charlie Austin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [59]}], "subs": [{"name": "Armand Traore", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex McCarthy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nedum Onuoha", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Karl Henry", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [74], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eduardo Vargas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [59], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bobby Zamora", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adel Taarabt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "It has taken longer than they would have liked but, finally, there is the sense that Manchester United have turned up. They have taken their time and the margin of victory has to be put into context when the opponents are so desperately anaemic, but it is a start and even a man of Louis van Gaal’s cavernous self-belief will be relieved to have his first Premier League win.\n\nHis team played at times as though they had suddenly remembered what is expected of a United side once they pull on those red shirts. They were quick, incisive and demonstrated a speed of thought that was simply too much for a team with QPR’s limitations.\n\nVan Gaal described it as a “new start” and talked of his intention to return the league championship to Old Trafford. If that sounds far-fetched for this season, this was at least a performance to encourage the belief that maybe the club are now back on an upward curve.\n\nÁngel di María, with the opening goal and a performance combining high skill and hard running, certainly wasted little time ingratiating himself with his new audience. Yet the extra surge of optimism was not just conjured up by the player with the £59.7m price tag.\n\nAnder Herrera’s accomplished performance brought him his first goal for his new club. Wayne Rooney scored a cracker and the returning self-belief should be further enhanced by the fact that all four goals arrived before that point in the second half when the electronic board went up to usher in Radamel Falcao, superstar.\n\nFalcao, restricted to a substitute’s role after his midweek game for Colombia, started warming up to raucous acclaim after 58 minutes and the Stretford End was still on its feet when Di María picked out Juan Mata to lash in the fourth goal. Old Trafford, for the first time in a while, felt like a happy, optimistic place and the only minor disappointment, perhaps, was that Falcao could not beat Rob Green when he had a late chance to join in the scoring.\n\nWhen Falcao did replace Mata, he was wearing one pink boot and one blue. QPR were already confused but Green was quickly off his line to deny him a debut goal.\n\nToo much can be read into one match, of course, and maybe the time to make more rounded judgments will be later in the autumn when Chelsea, Manchester City and Arsenal provide the opposition. Yet the last year has been such an ordeal at Old Trafford they will cherish what it felt like to be reminded of the old United. Van Gaal withdrew the 3-4-1-2 system that had plodded its way through the opening weeks of this season and there was a much more natural look now the team reverted to an orthodox back four rather than experimenting with wing-backs.\n\nInstead, Van Gaal created a midfield diamond with Daley Blind showing his positional sense and understanding of the game as the most withdrawn member of that quartet while Di María and Herrera provided the energy and penetration either side.\n\nMata is widely suspected to be the most vulnerable player in the wake of Falcao’s arrival but the team was largely set up to ensure he could operate in his best position. He played with distinction and maybe it is time to reassess.\n\nDi María started the rout in the 24th minute with a free-kick from the right that was intended as a cross but played with so much speed and bend it bounced inside the far post once it eluded all the players in a crowded penalty area. To say he meant it would be generous but it was a brilliant delivery that brought his good fortune.\n\nThe Argentinian was so eager to impress he eventually had to go off with cramp and his part in the second goal went a long way to showing why United shattered the British transfer record to sign him from Real Madrid. This time, it was a piece of classic, old-school United wing-play.\n\nHis run started inside his own half, picking up speed, driving forward and panicking his opponents all the way to the penalty area. United have desperately needed a wide player with this speed and penetration and the reverse pass to Rooney, taking out two defenders in the process, was a thing of beauty. Rooney’s effort was blocked but gave him the opportunity to lay the ball into Herrera’s path and the Spaniard thumped in a low shot.\n\nThere were still a few imperfections for Van Gaal to mull over and David de Gea was fortunate that Jonny Evans got back to spare him after a mistake, at 1-0, almost let in Matt Phillips.\n\nMarcos Rojo, playing ahead of the fit-again Luke Shaw at left-back, made a couple of mistakes that better opponents might have capitalised upon and there is still a vulnerable look to United’s defence, even if Tyler Blackett is looking more assured alongside Evans.\n\nThis was United’s second successive clean sheet but as Harry Redknapp volunteered afterwards, the time to judge properly is “whether they can cope with the forwards Chelsea have”.\n\nUnfortunately for him, QPR’s threat was nothing like so worrisome. They also played with a strange lack of ambition, as if nobody had told them how poor United have been at their own ground over the last year. Rio Ferdinand had a difficult return to his former club and Clint Hill came off after a first half that exposed his limitations at this level.\n\nRooney’s goal followed a neat exchange of passes involving Di María, Mata and Herrera, culminating in the striker turning on the ball and lashing a 20-yard drive into the bottom corner.\n\nThe game was now an exercise in damage limitation for Redknapp’s team and it was almost a surprise United and their glitzy new signings restricted themselves to only one more goal.\n\nMan of the match Ángel di María (Manchester United)"}, {"date":

in pictures\n\n\n\nBy the end, there was unmistakable disappointment on Arsène Wenger’s face and a heavy sense of regret engulfing the stands about Arsenal’s failure to capitalise on those goals from Jack Wilshere and, brilliantly, Alexis Sánchez that had turned the game upside down in 11 second-half minutes. Yet they will also know it might have been worse on a day when both sides could easily have won or lost and that culminated in a rare show of temper from Manuel Pellegrini.\n\nMartín Demichelis’s late header ultimately spared Manchester City a second successive defeat but they still had time to hit the post twice during that wild, chaotic finale when their opponents seemed to be doing everything possible to contrive a way to lose. Samir Nasri, facing his former club, was denied a stoppage-time winner because of an offside flag and City also had justifiable grievances that the referee, Mark Clattenburg, missed Wilshere’s handball inside the penalty area.\n\nArsenal limped to the finish but it would be unfair to reproach them too heavily when, earlier in the game, they had played as though affronted by their record against the top sides. Wenger and his players had been reminded all week about their sorry run of results in these high-importance fixtures but there was no sense of a side with an inferiority complex. They played with high skill and intensity and, more than that, they had to show considerable personality after going in behind at half-time to Sergio Agüero’s breakaway goal.\n\nTo recap, this is an Arsenal team that had taken 26 points out of a possible 90 against the teams they want to consider as bona fide rivals over the past five years. They set off like a team that wanted to show that statistic must be a glitch in the system, but for a long time after Agüero’s goal they found it difficult to get any momentum back. Vincent Kompany was a formidable opponent, as he always is in the big games, and David Silva’s nimble artistry between midfield and attack frequently troubled the home side.\n\nIt was a test of Arsenal’s character and, midway through the second half, they passed it with distinction. Wilshere equalised in the 63rd minute after running on to Aaron Ramsey’s pass, eluding Gaël Clichy and clipping a lovely diagonal shot above Joe Hart, and what followed was sensational.\n\nThis was one of Sánchez’s better performances from his brief time at Arsenal and it was a majestic volley with which he gave Arsenal the lead, even if Hart might have done better.\n\nIt was just a pity for Arsenal that everything started to unravel from that point. Wenger talked of conceding a “cheap goal” and he must have been startled by the carelessness of his team in the moments before and after Demichelis thudded a header past Wojciech Szczesny straight from a corner. “We did something remarkable to come back,” Wenger said. “The only disappointment for me is that we couldn’t keep the lead.”\n\nInstead, there was enough late pressure from City to feel they could have added one final, dramatic twist. Aleksandar Kolarov drove one shot against the upright and then another substitute, Edin Dzeko, was denied by the other post.\n\nDzeko had been on the pitch, Pellegrini said, because City’s manager was convinced Clattenburg would end up sending off Agüero. Fernandinho and Frank Lampard, two of City’s other booked players, had already been withdrawn and it was rare to hear Pellegrini be so critical of a referee’s performance. Uppermost in his mind was that there were “clear fouls” before both Arsenal goals. That was an exaggeration but, overall, he was justified to say Clattenburg had a “very bad day”.\n\nLampard had been held back for this game so Yaya Touré could have a break after playing for Ivory Coast in Cameroon on Wednesday but the 36-year-old looked his age on a difficult City debut. His yellow card, for sliding into Ramsey, had exposed his lack of match fitness and the game was played at an unforgiving speed.\n\nTo start with, Arsenal had the clear edge but Danny Welbeck, on a debut that showed his good and bad, opted for the lofted shot, the dainty little pitching wedge, when he ran clear early on with the chance to open the scoring; as Wenger acknowledged, it was almost certainly the wrong choice of club. The ball came back off the post, rebounding into Hart’s arms, and even at that early stage it was tempting to wonder whether the £16m signing might regret that wastefulness.\n\nSure enough, City broke in the 28th minute. Agüero went for the same ball as Mathieu Flamini in midfield and, as the ricochet spun it to the right, the Arsenal man hesitated, believing it was going for a throw-in. Jesús Navas had read the trajectory of the ball and as soon as he started haring down the line Arsenal were in trouble. His cross was beautifully weighted and Agüero had eluded Flamini to show his expertise in the penalty area.\n\nArsenal lost Mathieu Debuchy in the closing stages to a badly sprained ankle and they were looking dishevelled in those moments when the champions went searching for the winner. They very nearly found it but Arsenal, on the balance of play, had done enough before that point to think that it would have been unwarranted.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Arsenal’s Jack Wilshere celebrates his goal against Man City at the Emirates.

Where forwards from Chris Sutton to Fernando Torres via Andriy Shevchenko had once toiled, weighed down by oppressive transfer fees and associated expectations, Diego Costa’s staggering introduction to life in the Premier League is merely maintained. This hat-trick ensured his side’s perfect record was extended at the expense of that of Swansea’s, despite the forward having been hampered by a hamstring strain in the build-up to this game. Already it feels as if his limps, like those of Gordon Greenidge, are far more likely to leave opponents wincing.\n\nThis was a devastating display, a demonstration of strength and predatory finishing to confirm this team has upgraded significantly from last term’s inconsistent front-line. There was a powerful header forced through bodies in a packed penalty area, a side-footed finish swept beyond Lukasz Fabianski after a fine rat-a-tat build-up exchange between team-mates, and a smartly accepted third from Ramires’s scuffed shot.\n\nCosta retreated 18 minutes from time having now scored seven times in four league appearances, from 14 shots, for his new club. Torres took 43 games to register that many. The only other player to have scored in his first four games for Chelsea was Jack Meredith back in 1928, and he managed only two more thereafter. Costa’s stay should prove more productive.\n\nJust as encouraging is his almost telepathic relationship with Cesc Fàbregas, who grew into this game once team-mates had flocked to his aid in the middle, with the arrival from Barcelona adding another two assists – he now has six this season – to his own productive start to life in these parts. The way he combined with the excellent Eden Hazard 11 minutes after the interval, waiting for Ashley Williams to commit before pulling back for Costa to finish, was a reminder of true quality.\n\nRoman Abramovich, up in his executive box, spent most of the second half on his feet cooing at his players’ flowing moves. He even had a debut goal from the substitute Loïc Rémy, to celebrate before the end as this occasion, initially so awkward, degenerated into a thrashing.\n\nJosé Mourinho will have rejoiced in his side’s new-found bite in front of goal, their counterattacks brutally executed at times, though he will have taken as much heart from his players’ ability to recover from a sloppy, becalmed opening. This ended as much a show of character against slick, confident opponents as a demonstration of strength.\n\nSwansea had initially outnumbered their hosts in midfield, from where Ki Sung-yueng dictated much of the first half, and had deservedly led through a John Terry own goal converted from Neil Taylor’s skimmed centre. Garry Monk described his team’s play in that period as “some of the best we’ve ever played against this quality of team”. That was no exaggeration, so assured was their approach and incisive their forays forward.\n\nBafétimbi Gomis and Wayne Routledge might have doubled their lead, the winger curling agonisingly wide with Thibaut Courtois beaten. But having been spared further damage, the hosts eventually adapted, recovered and were rewarded. The trio of forwards stationed behind Costa tracked back to stifle Ki’s distribution at source and the aggressive running of Gylfi Sigurdsson and Jonjo Shelvey was smothered.\n\nFàbregas, initially out-muscled and overpowered, duly imposed his own qualities on the contest. It was his corner Costa converted beyond Fabianski, Jordi Amat having been preoccupied attempting to unnerve Branislav Ivanovic in the six-yard box.\n\nThat equaliser was timely, coming just before the interval, with Ramires’s introduction for the ineffective André Schürrle ensuring the hosts ripped the momentum back for good. They pressed with renewed vigour and Costa’s plunder took over, the hosts’ strength holding sway. The forward’s finishing was assured, Rémy’s immediate impact having replaced the scorer of the hat-trick adding to the locals’ sense of glee. Didier Drogba, nursing an ankle injury, was not missed.\n\n“We made changes and were too strong for them in the end,” said Mourinho. “We changed everything at half-time and, with the intensity we showed in that second half, they could not compete. We could give to the stadium what the crowd were waiting for: a win secured in a beautiful way.”\n\nShelvey still exploited some defensive vulnerability late on to claw back a consolation – Swansea did not deserve to feel scorched – but Chelsea, just as they had at Everton in their previous fixture, are confident they can out-gun all-comers. “You saw the power and quality Chelsea have in that second half,” Monk said. “I think they’ll be champions.”\n\nManchester City, five points adrift of the early leaders, will test that theory at the Etihad on 21 September though, for now, Costa and Co are irrepressible."}, {"date": "13/09/2014", "arena": "Selhurst Park", "attendance": 23829, "home_team": {"name": "Crystal Palace", "lineup": [{"name": "Julian Speroni", "yellows": [], "reds": [],

commitment or endeavour on display and there will certainly be worse matches in the Premier League this season. Both sides worked hard and tried to win. There were some near misses, a couple of scrambles, the return of Neil Warnock and Wilfried Zaha to Selhurst Park and even some late drama when Julián Speroni made a wonderful save from Scott Arfield’s penalty to deny Burnley their first win since promotion.\n\nIt was just a shame about the lack of quality that let both sides down.\n\nBurnley will feel that they should have left with the points after Mike Dean pointed to the spot when Mile Jedinak hauled down Lukas Jutkiewicz, but although Arfield’s penalty was firmly struck, it was close enough for Speroni, so often the Palace hero, to fling up an arm and push it away.\n\nA second consecutive goalless draw for Sean Dyche’s side, then, and relief for Warnock, even though Palace also remain winless after four league matches.\n\nPalace will argue that they had chances to win, but their finishing was shoddy and, ultimately, Burnley’s organisation highlighted their attacking deficiencies. Warnock’s side did not play with enough creativity and it was a disappointing afternoon for Zaha, who will take time to regain his confidence after his Manchester United nightmare. The winger had his moments and could have scored, but he had faded long before he was replaced by Yannick Bolasie after 69 minutes.\n\nOn a more positive note, Palace are now unbeaten in two games, after the last-gasp draw at Newcastle, and at least the return of Warnock for a second spell here has brought some stability after the departure of Tony Pulis, even though he was not exactly at the top of the Steve Parish’s list when he began the search for a new manager.\n\nIt was the other old face who Palace’s supporters were most excited about becoming reacquainted with, though. Zaha’s stoppage-time equaliser against Newcastle earned Warnock a point in his first match back and the forward was the last out of the tunnel here, ensuring that he received a grand reception when he emerged.\n\nThere was another huge cheer when Zaha’s name was read out, and for a while Palace were energised by the buoyant atmosphere. Damien Delaney fired inches over, Scott Dann headed against the bar, Dwight Gayle was wayward from 18 yards and Jason Shackell almost scored an own goal after a weaving run and shot from Zaha.\n\nBurnley were fortunate to escape unscathed during that period and their task was made more complicated when Danny Ings, who was booked for dive early on, limped off. “He’s snapped his leg down to get the ball and his hamstring’s gone tight,” Dyche said. “It will be another 48 hours before we know.”\n\nThe loss of Ings did not derail Burnley and they improved in the second half. This was their first away clean sheet in the Premier League, which was news to a pleasantly surprised Dyche. But for Speroni, they would have had more to celebrate."}, {"date": "13/09/2014", "arena": " Mary's Stadium", "attendance": 29678, "home_team": {"name": "Southampton", "lineup": [{"name": "Fraser Forster", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathaniel Clyne", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "José Fonte", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Toby Alderweireld", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Bertrand", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Davis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Morgan Schneiderlin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [90], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Cork", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [54], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shane Long", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Graziano Pellè", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [6, 19], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dusan Tadic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [67]}], "subs": [{"name": "Kelvin Davis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Maya Yoshida", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Florin Gardos", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Wanyama", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Ward-Prowse", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [67], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Emmanuel Mayuka", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sam McQueen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Newcastle United", "lineup": [{"name": "Tim Krul", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daryl Janmaat", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mike Williamson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fabricio Coloccini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Massadio Haidara", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Vurnon Anita", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Jack Colback", "yellows": [45], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rémy Cabella", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [69]}, {"name": "Moussa Sissoko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Yoan Gouffran", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Emmanuel Riviere", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Ayoze Pérez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [69], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rob Elliot", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cheick Tiote", "yellows": [57], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gabriel Obertan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Taylor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sammy Ameobi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Armstrong", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Newcastle fans had demanded signs of change; they were given a new low. After a startlingly rotten performance at St Mary’s, Newcastle lie bottom of the Premier League and patience with Alan Pardew seems close to expiring.\n\nThe travelling supporters certainly made their wishes clear: there were anti-Pardew banners and chants and, at the final whistle, one fan was so unbalanced by fury that he charged towards the visiting dugout before being restrained by stewards.\n\nMike Ashley is no populist and the club banned another newspaper this week (taking the total of banned publications to seven) for claiming that Pardew had only two matches to save his job but, even so, it is hard to imagine this being allowed to continue much longer. The statistics are awful – five points from the past 36 available, eight failures to score in their past 10 away matches – and it will take something extraordinary to reverse the trend. “Unless someone tells me otherwise, I’ll continue to prepare the team,” said Pardew after the latest defeat.\n\nThe very last thing Pardew wanted was a repeat of his team’s wretched display here in March, when they lost 4-0 and barely seemed bothered. He got the same scoreline and a performance that may well have been worse.\n\nNewcastle were slovenly from the start and almost fell behind within 40 seconds. Fabricio Coloccini left a back-pass short and Tim Krul’s rushed clearance was charged down by Shane Long before bouncing inches wide. The visitors did not sharpen up. Five minutes later, the hosts helped themselves to the opening goal.\n\nFollowing a routine throw-in move on the left, Ryan Bertrand was allowed to dash in-field and collect a through ball before placing a perfect cross on to the head of the unmarked Graziano Pellè. Given how comfortable the visiting defence had made him feel, it would have been rude for the Italian not to nod into the net.\n\nThere was little trace of spirit or cohesion from Newcastle, who were being outfought and outplayed by a team that appears to have retained all of last season’s form and vigour despite significant player turnover and the arrival of a new manager, Ronald Koeman. In the 19th minute Southampton increased their lead, thanks to more Newcastle sloppiness and a dollop of good fortune. After Mike Williamson misdirected a header, Pellè tried to score from long range but his mishit shot turned into a pass to Dusan Tadic, who played the ball back to the Italian to tap in a second goal.\n\nNewcastle began to show signs of life, but Fraser Forster made fine saves to deny Moussa Sissoko and Jack Colback. The visitors then had a bout of possession but no one showed the creativity to profit. Newcastle’s fans had a three-word answer to that problem: “Hatem Ben Arfa,” they chanted in reference to the schemer who has been loaned to Hull after falling out with Pardew.\n\nIn the 54th minute the hosts scored a third and again greater appetite seemed key. Steven Davis slipped a ball behind the Newcastle defence and Jack Cork reached it before Williamson and Krul before rolling it into the empty net.\n\nIt became increasingly difficult to spot redeeming qualities in the visitors. At one point Rémy Cabella seemed to wonder if his team-mates had given up, as he carried the ball backwards under pressure from two opponents and could not find anyone on his own team in a position to accept a pass. The Frenchman’s exasperation was clear.\n\nA misjudgment by Foster in the 78th minute should have led to a Newcastle goal but Colback and Emmanuel Rivière miscued from close range.\n\nIn the last minute Southampton crafted a goal of beauty, swapping 38 passes before Morgan Schneiderlin curled a shot into the top corner.\n\nPardew accepted the chants of Newcastle fans had foundation. “They are fair because you can’t get beat 4-0 as Newcastle manager,” he said. “We just have to put ourselves on the line really and be brave. We have more quality than we showed today for sure. We need to get that on the pitch.”"}, {"date": "13/09/2014", "arena": "Bet365 Stadium", "attendance": 27500, "home_team": {"name": "Stoke City", "lineup": [{"name": "Asmir Begovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Bardsley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Shawcross", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marc Wilson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Erik Pieters", "yellows": [49], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [84]}, {"name": "Glenn Whelan", "yellows": [64], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven N'Zonzi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jon Walters", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [82]}, {"name": "Bojan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [74]}, {"name": "Victor Moses", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Peter Crouch", "yellows": [29], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Oussama Assaidi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [82], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robert Huth", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marc Muniesa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [84], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marko Arnautovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charlie Adam", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mame Biram Diouf", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [74], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Thomas Sorensen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Leicester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Ben Hamer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ritchie de Laet", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wes Morgan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Liam Moore", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paul Konchesky", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Riyad Mahrez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Andy King", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Dean Hammond", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jeffrey Schlupp", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [76]}, {"name": "Leonardo Ulloa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [64], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Nugent", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Danny Drinkwater", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jamie Vardy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [76], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Esteban Cambiasso", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Anthony Knockaert", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marcin Wasilewski", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Smith", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Wood", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Nigel Pearson praised the impact made by Esteban Cambiasso on his Premier League debut as Leicester secured their first victory of the season. Leicester, who had not won a Premier League game since their last season in the top flight in 2003-04, were outplayed in the first half but the game changed when Pearson sent on Cambiasso and Danny Drinkwater during the break, and Leonardo Ulloa came up with his third goal of the season to clinch the points.\n\nCambiasso settled into the team immediately and began to pull the strings in midfield on his first appearance since moving from Inter at the end of the transfer window.\n\nPearson said: “We didn’t feel we played with the same sort of control we have in our other games so far this season. The changes at half-time certainly allowed us to get a little bit more control. We changed the shape and a couple of personnel, which allowed us to get back into the game.\n\n“His [Cambiasso’s] game management is exceptional. He’s not had the success he’s had over his career without showing qualities, not just with the ball but in terms of his organisational skills. .\n\n“He was a very important influence on the game in the second half. But we functioned better as a team as well.\n\n“There were a lot of goalmouth incidents in the game and at times we had to, not ride our luck but defend with a lot of commitment. It wasn’t an easy game by any stretch of the imagination.\n\n“I think 45 minutes for him [Cambiasso] was probably about right in terms of an introduction to English football and I’m pleased that he’s played his part in what is a very important win for us.”\n\nAnother Premier League debutant for Leicester was the goalkeeper Ben Hamer, who stepped in after Kasper Schmeichel picked up an injury on international duty. Hamer had some shaky moments in the first half but grew in confidence and earned a point for his side with terrific late saves from Mame Biram Diouf and Victor Moses.\n\nPearson said: “I thought he handled the occasion exceptionally well when you consider he’s replacing a player who’s been one of our top performers over the last three or four years.\n\n“There were aspects of his performance we would like to improve but he made some key saves for us in the second half. The very fact we didn’t really look too flustered reflects that the players have faith in his ability.”\n\nStoke stunned Manchester City at the Etihad in their last match but have yet to pick up a point at home or score a league goal, leaving Mark Hughes very frustrated. The Stoke manager felt his side dominated the game and was unhappy that Peter Crouch was not given a penalty for an apparent push in the back.\n\n“I thought for the most part we did OK today,” said the Welshman.\n\n“I was pleased at half-time, albeit we just needed that break at the right time. Unfortunately nothing dropped for us,” said Hughes.\n\n“At some point in the Premier League the opposition will get an opportunity. Then it’s important that we defend that situation correctly but unfortunately we didn’t. “We’ve got to find a way because we’ve talked about this at length, that teams will come here and show us respect in terms of what we can do to them, so they will set up and try and frustrate us.\n\n“We did a similar thing at Manchester City and got a positive result, and everyone’s patting us on the back.

This shared conviction left Sunderland’s manager looking on disconsolate as, inspired by Christian Eriksen, Pochettino’s Tottenham monopolised the ball. Somehow, however, the Uruguayan ended the afternoon smiling.\n\nHis side’s sheer bloody-minded resilience – aided by Harry Kane’s own goal – secured a point. Not that it will be lost on Poyet that his largely outclassed Wearsiders had looked sunk until Emanuele Giaccherini’s liberation from the bench.\n\n“I’m really, really pleased,” Poyet said. “Spurs are by the far the best team we’ve played. It was a really hard point.”\n\nWhile Sunderland sought their first league win of the season, Tottenham were determined to exorcise memories of their 3-0 home defeat against Liverpool a fortnight ago and made a suitably high-octane start in the warm sunshine.\n\nA compelling game had barely kicked off when the outstanding Eriksen slipped a sublime pass to Danny Rose, whose shot was parried to safety by a somewhat startled Vito Mannone. A minute later Sunderland’s goalkeeper failed to hold an Emmanuel Adebayor shot and watched Nacer Chadli direct the rebound beyond his reach.\n\nThe visiting fans hardly had time to celebrate before they were reminded that their defence remains a work in progress. That unit seemed to momentarily stand back and admire Adam Johnson as the winger sashayed in from the left and unleashed a right-foot shot that was deflected beyond Hugo Lloris.\n\nMannone did extremely well to block Adebayor’s volley following the striker’s cute one-two with Eriksen but gradually things turned slightly more sedate. There were some lovely little passing triangles to observe from Spurs as, with the excellent Mousa Dembélé controlling central midfield, they emphasised just how far Sunderland have to travel if they are to become similarly assured in the arts of pass and move and positional interchange.\n\nPoyet is very keen to turn his team into a possession-hogging, controlled passing outfit and, under his tutelage, they have made big strides away from the deep defending, counterattacking strategy that was their hallmark under Martin O’Neill. Here, though, Tottenham’s superiority on the ball forced them to spend long periods without it, defending in numbers. It made life horribly tough for Ricardo Álvarez, the Argentinian making his debut wide on the right of Poyet’s midfield after arriving on a season-long loan from Internazionale.\n\nÁlvarez and company enjoyed some fortunate moments – most notably when Dembélé’s 30-yard shot rebounded off a post with Mannone well beaten and when Erik Lamela’s attempted pass to Adebayor was diverted by Santiago Vergini’s arm, only for the referee to dismiss visiting penalty appeals – yet still appeared destined for inevitable defeat.\n\nDespite Lee Cattermole’s best efforts to hold Sunderland together, the immensely impressive Eriksen restored the visiting lead. Untypically from such a delicately subtle player the goal was somewhat untidy. It resulted from a home failure to clear Chadli’s cross, with Eriksen extending a boot and bundling the ball across the line from close range.\n\nOn came Giaccherini – who surely should have started – and Will Buckley in place of Sebastian Larsson and Álvarez. Giaccherini, particularly, improved Sunderland and Johnson was unlucky to see a long-range shot fly fractionally wide.\n\nTaking the hint, Pochettino replaced Chadli with his new defensive midfielder, Benjamin Stambouli. Suitably fortified, Spurs might have extended their lead had Lamela’s clever chip not rebounded back off the bar but instead Sunderland stole a highly unlikely point.\n\nIt featured two substitutes fresh from the bench and involved Jordi Gómez’s curving free kick being diverted past his own goalkeeper by the unfortunate Kane as Connor Wickham, technically accomplished throughout, provided invaluable nuisance value.\n\n“I’m very disappointed,” said Pochettino. “We had a lot of chances. We didn’t kill the game but we were unlucky.”"}, {"date": "13/09/2014", "arena": "The Hawthorns", "attendance": 23567, "home_team": {"name": "West Bromwich Albion", "lineup": [{"name": "Ben Foster", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andre Wisdom", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Craig Dawson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonas Olsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sébastien Pocognoli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [77]}, {"name": "Graham Dorrans", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Morrison", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Craig Gardner", "yellows": [26], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Brunt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [70]}, {"name": "Saido Berahino", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Brown Ideye", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [70]}], "subs": [{"name": "Chris Baird", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Claudio Yacob", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cristian Gamboa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [77], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Luke Daniels", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gareth McAuley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sebastian Blanco", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [70], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Georgios Samaras", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [70], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Everton", "lineup": [{"name": "Tim Howard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Seamus Coleman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Stones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Jagielka", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leighton Baines", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James McCarthy", "yellows": [53], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gareth Barry", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aiden McGeady", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [88]}, {"name": "Steven Naismith", "yellows": [81], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin Mirallas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [66], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Romelu Lukaku", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [2], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [68]}], "subs": [{"name": "Joel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Darron Gibson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Muhamed Besic", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [88], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Atsu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leon Osman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [68], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Luke Garbutt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Antolin Alcaraz", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "It is easy to see why Alan Irvine has pleaded for time, but patience is already wearing thin at The Hawthorns. A second successive Premier League defeat, marked by two calamitous individual mistakes, was the cue for boos to reverberate at the final whistle, as the West Bromwich Albion supporters vented their anger.\n\nAn unpopular appointment when he was named as Pepe Mel’s replacement – and tasked with the considerable job of rebuilding the team after a chaotic summer in which 13 players left and 11 arrived – Irvine has his work cut out. An already difficult job was made harder still here, after Jonas Olsson and Ben Foster pressed the self-destruct button, gifting Everton both goals.\n\nRomelu Lukaku, returning to the club where he enjoyed such a productive season-long loan in 2012-13, scored Everton’s first after only 100 seconds, when he punished Olsson’s dreadful clearance – the second game running that the Swede has handed the opposition a goal inside two minutes. Kevin Mirallas then grabbed the second, after keeper Foster allowed the winger’s tame shot to slip under his body.\n\nUp against the club where he spent three spells – as a player, assistant manager and academy director – Irvine knew that he would get no favours. What the Scot could never have imagined, however, was that his players would be such a danger to their own team.\n\nAlbion huffed and puffed in response to falling behind, but never really looked like recovering once Mirallas had doubled Everton’s lead, on a highly satisfactory afternoon for Roberto Martínez and his players.\n\nComing into this game on the back of 6-3 home defeat by Chelsea, Everton departed celebrating a first victory of the season, and a much-needed first clean sheet. There was also the sight of Lukaku registering his first goal since his club-record £28m move from Chelsea. It was the striker’s 33rd Premier League goal in all – but, incredibly, the first time he has scored for a club that owns him.\n\nHow Albion must wish that the Belgium international was still leading their line. Instead, Irvine was left to reflect on the absence of a cutting edge up front, and the two defining moments in the match, when his players made the sort of errors that any coach or manager is powerless to do anything about.\n\n“You’re talking about two international players – two proven Premier League players – and they don’t normally make those kind of mistakes,” Irvine said. “For us to make one, let alone two in the same game, is unusual. The lads are devastated with the goals, but mistakes happen. We just have to accept them and move on.”\n\nAsked about the fans’ reaction at the end, Irvine said: “I understand it. We’re all frustrated, we all came here today hoping that we were going to get a really good performance and a really good result, so I can understand the fans being frustrated and disappointed – because it’s how I feel as well and it’s how the players feel.\n\n“They know that for a fair part of that game they were playing well, and they know that individual errors have cost them.”\n\nAs much as Olsson was culpable for the first goal – when he made a pig’s ear of trying to clear a cross from Leighton Baines – there was much to admire about the way Lukaku curled a sumptuous shot, from the edge of the area, into the far corner. What followed was not so much a muted celebration as a full-on apology, prompting a round of applause from the Albion supporters.\n\nMartínez was just delighted to see the ball hit the net. “He is only a young man, but we didn’t mind the [transfer] sum because I knew it was money well spent,” the Everton manager said.\n\nSteven Naismith should have doubled Everton’s lead early in the second half, but he lifted the ball over the bar after Foster had repelled Lukaku’s raking drive. However, it was only a temporary reprieve for Albion. Mirallas, cutting in from the left in the 66th minute, struck a low shot that Foster seemed to have covered – until he dived over the top of the ball.\n\nThe Albion keeper did make a couple of fine saves to thwart Leon Osman late on, but, by then, the damage was done."}, {"date": "13/09/2014", "arena": "Anfield", "attendance": 44689, "home_team": {"name": "Liverpool", "lineup": [{"name": "Simon

"report": "Aston Villa preserved their unbeaten run by inflicting a second defeat of the season on Liverpool, who will have to concentrate harder than this if they are to make progress when Champions League football returns to Anfield on Tuesday.\n\nVilla were worth the win, which leaves them with 10 points from their first four games, even if they got lucky when Philippe Coutinho struck a post with a firm drive eight minutes from the end. The visitors never allowed the home side to settle in midfield and defended an early goal well for over an hour, with Nathan Baker giving a heroic impression of Ron Vlaar in the centre of defence.\n\n“We showed no fear,” Paul Lambert said. “It was a fantastic performance and result. Tactically, we were spot-on, the lads have grasped what we have been working on in training. Not that they are really lads any more. Our young players have grown into men.”\n\nLiverpool cannot say they were not warned. In this fixture last season, Villa raced to a two-goal lead before being pegged back to a 2-2 draw, they won at Anfield the season before that, and Steven Gerrard admitted beforehand that the Midlands side had a good recent record against Liverpool.\n\nThe tone for most games is set inside the first 15 or 20 minutes, according to Gerrard, who also claimed in his programme notes that his side started so well in their last outing at Spurs, establishing a solid defensive platform and going on to control the game, that the margin of victory could easily have been greater than three goals.\n\nHe would not have been able to say the same about this match. Liverpool started quite poorly, particularly in defence, and were a goal down after eight minutes. First, Mamadou Sakho allowed Gabriel Agbonlahor to claim a ball that should never have been his and was forced to concede an unnecessary corner, and a blocked Philippe Senderos header from Ashley Westwood’s cross stood up invitingly for Agbonlahor to poke into the bottom corner. Managers are never impressed when goals are conceded at set pieces and Liverpool were lucky not to give away another one four minutes later, when Senderos found space to get on the end of a Westwood free-kick but headed too high.\n\nVilla could only be encouraged and, with Adam Lallana marking his debut with a booking for a rash challenge on Tom Cleverley and Javier Manquillo having to make a smart recovery after being surprised by Agbonlahor’s pace, there was no doubt which side had bossed the first quarter. Mario Balotelli was struggling to get into the game, though the Italian was hardly helped by the myopic officiating that allowed Senderos to get away with a clear trip after the ball had gone. Balotelli also had reason to feel aggrieved about subsequent challenges by Senderos and Alan Hutton but limited his reaction to picking himself up slowly and looking balefully at the referee.\n\nLiverpool were missing the pace and penetration of the rested Raheem Sterling, yet that could hardly be offered as an excuse for the difficulty they were experiencing defending set pieces. Villa sensed vulnerability at every free-kick and corner and could have gone two up before the interval when Hutton glanced on a Westwood corner for Senderos’s first-time shot to clear the bar. Lallana shot narrowly wide as the interval approached and Balotelli was reasonably close with a speculative effort from the angle of the area but the home side’s clearest break of the first half came in stoppage time, when Alberto Moreno found a way behind the Villa defenders but Kieran Richardson got back in time to cut out his cross.\n\nBrendan Rodgers watched Liverpool’s attacks being comfortably repulsed by the outstanding Baker and the rest of the visiting defence for 15 minutes of the second half before sending on Sterling, who was welcomed to the game by a scything tackle from Hutton for which the Villa full-back was rightly booked. Sterling beat Cleverley with his first chance to run at Villa with the ball at his feet, only to produce a shot that landed in the middle of the Kop.\n\nWith Villa barely crossing the halfway line in the second period and Liverpool seeing plenty of the ball, the only question for the final half-hour was how long the visitors would be able to last out. Rodgers freshened his attack with Rickie Lambert and Fabio Borini for the last 20 minutes, the former replacing the labouring Balotelli and the latter gaining an unexpected chance at the expense of Lazar Markovic, who had actually looked one of Liverpool’s more promising players going forward. None of the changes worked, with Lambert making a mess of his only decent chance.\n\nCoutinho almost rescued a point, but Villa fully deserved the victory for their overall organisation and determined defending. “We’re going to win the league,” the fans in the Anfield Road end chorused. That might be a teeny bit premature, but second-placed Villa have made a solid start.\n\nLiverpool are proving hit and miss. “We started too slowly and never created enough,” Rodgers said. “We couldn’t quite find the quality with the final ball. We couldn’t break Villa down, and that was frustrating.”"}, {"date": "31/08/2014", "arena": "Villa Park", "attendance": 28336, "home_team": {"name": "Aston Villa", "lineup": [{"name": "Brad Guzan", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alan Hutton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Philippe Senderos", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ron Vlaar", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aly Cissokho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kieran  Richardson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [75]}, {"name": "Ashley Westwood", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fabian Delph", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charles N'Zogbia", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [64]}, {"name": "Andreas Weimann", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [36], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gabriel Agbonlahor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [14], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [85]}], "subs": [{"name": "Nathan Baker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leandro Bacuna", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Cole", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Darren Bent", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [85], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Carlos Sánchez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [64], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shay Given", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Grealish", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [75], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Hull City", "lineup": [{"name": "Allan McGregor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paul McShane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Dawson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Curtis Davies", "yellows": [42], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Ahmed Elmohamady", "yellows": [84], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jake Livermore", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Huddlestone", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [71]}, {"name": "Stephen Quinn", "yellows": [87], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andrew Robertson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nikica Jelavic", "yellows": [82], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [74], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Ince", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [57]}], "subs": [{"name": "Liam Rosenior", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex Bruce", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Meyler", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robbie Brady", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [57], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yannick Sagbo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steve Harper", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sone Aluko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [71], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "So conspicuous by its absence was any negativity at Villa Park on Sunday afternoon that the Holte End started chanting for Paul Lambert to give them a wave after 40 minutes. It has been a long while since Aston Villa fans have felt sufficiently comfortable midway through a game to seek to bond so with their manager. Then again it is not too often they have been 2-0 up by half-time with a top-four placing in the bag for the next fortnight.\n\nSteve Bruce, the Hull City manager, labelled his team’s “pathetic” first-half showing as the worst in his two years in charge, as Villa equalled their best start to a season in the Premier League, with seven points from the opening three games, last achieved at the start of Martin O’Neill’s reign in 2006. You have to go all the way back to 1962 for the last time Villa started better.\n\nYet the ambivalence surrounding Villa is reflected by the statistic that, on the day the sun went down on August, their first three shots on target in the league have yielded their first three goals. But solid and steady is better than much experienced at Villa Park in the past four years so, added to Andreas Weimann’s winning goal on the opening day at Stoke City, Sunday’s excellent start gave Lambert’s team the platform from which they proved able to withstand Hull’s improved showing.\n\nWith Randy Lerner still looking for new owners, Villa are fulfilling their mid-term target of keeping the team buoyantly, and thus attractively, placed. No one was kidded into asking Lambert any questions about qualifying for the Champions League after this decent start to a campaign although after Hull’s exit from the Europa League, on away goals to Lokeren, Bruce might advocate that getting into continental competition is not such an enticing proposition.\n\nThe Hull manager did not want to use Thursday’s Euro exit as an excuse for his team’s insipid opening and only four players started both games. But the disappointment of that first European adventure did seem to infiltrate their play. Fabian Delph cracked a shot against the outside of a post before Gabriel Agbonlahor and Weimann scored, and Ashley Westwood curled a free-kick against the woodwork before Bruce withdrew Curtis Davies, his captain, at the interval and went to a back four. Nikica Jelavic pulled a goal back late on as Hull rallied but Villa deserved to win.\n\n“We gave ourselves such a mountain to climb with the performance in the first half,” Bruce said. “That was arguably the worst I’ve seen us perform in my two years here. Thankfully there was a response to that and we took the game to Villa in the second half and on another day could’ve nicked something. But I still can’t get over how bad we were in the first half.\n\n“I’ve not seen so many players play so badly. Hangover or whatever it was, I won’t accept it. We were so lifeless it was incredible. To take something from a Premier League game, you have to perform like we did in the second half for all the game.\n\n“We gifted them goals, we made mistake after mistake, we didn’t get above a jog, so how do you expect to win a Premier League game? It’s a shock to me. But maybe it’s a wake-up call. We can’t wait for me to be ranting and raving like a lunatic at half-time. If we hadn’t woken up, it would’ve been a cricket score.”\n\nVilla looked as if they could declare at 2-0 and still win. They went ahead when Jelavic gave the ball away too easily for Charles N’Zogbia to feed to Weimann whose short pass to feet invited Agbonlahor to turn his man on the edge of the penalty area and hit his first goal at home this year.\n\nThen Delph, fresh from his England call-up, nicked the ball off Michael Dawson, on his Hull debut, and passed for Agbonlahor to slip in the advancing Kieran Richardson who pulled the ball back for Weimann to control with his first touch and shoot home with his second.\n\nHull were much improved in the latter stages after Robbie Brady, having scored twice against Lokeren, replaced the disappointing Tom Ince and crossed for Jelavic to head in off Aly Cissokho.Neither Villa nor Hull, having had £8million bids for Tom Cleverley accepted by Manchester United, anticipate signing the former England player, as they have been put off by his wage demands.\n\nMan of the match Gabriel Agbonlahor (Aston Villa)"}, {"date": "31/08/2014", "arena": "White Hart

Last week’s loss to Manchester City at the Etihad has been exorcised in thrilling fashion, visiting players a blur of movement against panicked opponents whose own encouraging start to the season has been put in proper context. Tottenham Hotspur had shipped five to these rivals last term but, at times, this felt every bit as chastening.\n\nBrendan Rodgers could not have envisaged a more satisfying way to celebrate a century of games in charge, his 56th win in that time matching the records of Bill Shankly and Rafael Benítez. If his team’s progress through their first two fixtures had suggested they were still embroiled in a period of post-Luis Suárez adjustment, then this was them reimposing their credentials. Raheem Sterling was irrepressible, every bit as threatening as he had been last December, while Jordan Henderson swarmed around central midfield and Daniel Sturridge demonstrated he can provide a supply line as well as a finishing touch these days.\n\nThey have added Alberto Moreno’s aggression and jet-propelled pace down the left. The full-back was the scorer of a fine goal and was generally far more impressive here than he had been when more pertinently tested at City on Monday. Mario Balotelli, who had drawn the pre-match focus, was hardly required to revel on debut. Yet the reality that Rodgers even coaxed a performance of impressive work-rate from the £16m arrival from Milan also bodes well. Balotelli’s radar was uncharacteristically awry in front of goal but his composure in the six-yard box will return. Liverpool had him defending corners for the first time in his career, and holding up the ball superbly against Younès Kaboul with his back to goal. If he can maintain the industry and eagerness to combine with team-mates that typified his display in little over an hour here Liverpool really will have secured a bargain.\n\nThe Italian will add to their options up front, but this was Liverpool rediscovering last season’s zest. They hassled and harried the composure from Spurs here, Mauricio Pochettino’s team denied any time to consider their options on the ball and too often lethargic in chasing back possession once it had been surrendered. They seemed dazed. Dismantling Queens Park Rangers, or even triumphing at West Ham, is all well and good but, when jolted out of their own rhythm, they lacked the nous to recover. “We are a team who are still improving, still learning,” said Pochettino. “We were up against a very good team who almost won the Premier League last season and have built the team for more than two years. But that’s no excuse. We lost this in the key moments of the game.”\n\nThey had trailed early, Sturridge teasing space from Jan Vertonghen and Nacer Chadli before liberating Henderson, whose centre was converted neatly by Sterling at the far post. Yet having been spared a second concession by Balotelli’s profligacy – a pair of headers from close range and a miscued volley from distance with Hugo Lloris out of his area which dribbled wide – they should have equalised when Kaboul’s diagonal pass confused Mamadou Sakho and Dejan Lovren to leave Chadli in possession in front of goal. Yet Simon Mignolet saved that attempt and, if that had hinted at a shift in momentum just before the break, the award of a soft penalty to the visitors rather knocked the stuffing from Tottenham’s challenge.\n\nEric Dier, exposed here for the first time since his summer arrival from Sporting Lisbon, was penalised for a tug back on Joe Allen. “Soft,” claimed Pochettino, though the contact was ill-advised. Steven Gerrard scored his 43rd penalty for the club and Liverpool were not finished there. Pochettino flung on Andros Townsend to chase the game but the winger was dispossessed by Alberto Moreno inside the visitors’ half and pursued the full-back as he seared upfield. There was no catching the Spaniard, his finish from inside the penalty area dispatched crisply inside the far post to settle the contest.\n\nSterling should have added a fourth after a glorious dribble that left opponents on their knees only for anxiety to grip, indecision choking the finish at a grateful Lloris. “He dribbled through the Spurs defence like Ricky Villa, but his finish was more like Ricky Gervais,” said Rodgers. “But he was exceptional. His tactical awareness is improving, and for a kid of 19 … he’s going to be great, even if he does have to work a bit on that left foot.” Opponents will not always offer him this much space, but Spurs tend to be obliging. Liverpool have now scored 14 times against Tottenham in the last 300 minutes of games between the sides, with the London club having failed to register at all in that period.\n\nThey anticipate concluding the signing of Montpellier’s Benjamin Stambouli, a defensive midfielder of considerable promise, on deadline day and he should add to their steel in the centre, with Etienne Capoue in particular having reverted to last year’s rather laboured form here. Others will be moved on, with QPR interested in taking Sandro and Aaron Lennon, and Crystal Palace hoping to sign the left-back Zeki Fryers, most likely on loan. This Spurs team are still learning how to impose the style Pochettino demands, their side very much a work in progress. Liverpool, on this evidence, feel much more like the finished article.\n\nMan of the match Raheem Sterling (Liverpool)"}, {"date": "31/08/2014", "arena": "The King Power Stadium", "attendance": 31535,

dubious claim that Arsenal are well-stocked in the striker department and under no pressure to bring in a replacement for the injured Olivier Giroud before the transfer window shutters come down. Yaya Sanogo was given the job of leading the line but was withdrawn 13 minutes from time, still without a goal in 17 Arsenal appearances and, on this evidence, well short of being the centre-forward his club need.\n\nWith the game deep into time added on the Arsenal supporters offered their own damning judgment on what they had witnessed on an afternoon when Leicester played with tremendous energy and thoroughly deserved a point. “Sign a fucking striker” reverberated from the travelling fans.\n\nBathed in sunshine, the mood of the Arsenal faithful was darkened by the absence of a cutting edge as Wenger’s side registered 24 attempts at goal – more than in any game last season – but only six were on target.\n\nWenger introduced Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Lukas Podolski – one of the other forwards at his service – late on but his team had run out of ideas by that stage and the Arsenal manager was honest enough to admit to being genuinely concerned that Leicester, who looked dangerous on the counter-attack, may go on and pinch a winner. Jamie Vardy nearly did with just seven minutes remaining, when the Leicester substitute broke free only to be denied by a full-stretch save from Wojciech Szczesny.\n\nAsked about what the Arsenal fans were singing, Wenger replied: “Every solution every time you don’t win a game is to buy somebody anyway. We try our best and you have to trust us to find the best possible solution, but as well not to every time you don’t win think that it’s a miracle-man who wins you a game. Why did Man City not win yesterday against Stoke? They have plenty of strikers.”\n\nThere was, however, no escaping the fact that Sanogo looked like a man short of confidence and nowhere near ready to be the frontline striker for a club of Arsenal’s stature.\n\nSanogo had a less-than-convincing hand in the opener, when Kasper Schmeichel deflected the forward’s poor attempt to lob him into the path of Alexis Sánchez, who swept home his first Premier League goal. It was symptomatic of Sanogo’s contribution. A one-on-one chance in the second half, after a fine run from Nacho Monreal on the Arsenal left, was also passed up.\n\nWenger admitted Sanogo’s goal drought is now an issue. “You have been 21 and you start playing football and if you play up front and you don’t score it’s very quickly a problem,” he said.\n\n“I don’t think that problem will last very long. But at the moment, yes, when you have a chance to play for Arsenal as a centre-forward and you don’t score, it’s a problem for you.\n\n“He did find it very hard today. You can say he didn’t score, yes. Is it on his mind? Of course, because he’s a striker and he scored always many goals as a young player.”\n\nSanogo, in fairness, was not the only Arsenal player that struggled on a day when Mesut Özil was anonymous. It was also a clear mistake to allow Laurent Koscielny to return to the pitch after he had required lengthy treatment following a clash of heads with Jeff Schlupp.\n\nWhen Schlupp broke away on the left, following a neat exchange with David Nugent, and delivered a superb centre towards the back post, Koscielny was caught ball-watching, unaware of Leonardo Ulloa, whose powerful header sailed into the far corner to quickly level the scores. Four minutes later Koscielny was withdrawn and replaced by Calum Chambers.\n\n“I think if he wasn’t injured we would not have conceded the goal,” Wenger said. “I had been told it was nothing serious and he could come back after two minutes with two clips on his head. That was a medical opinion. After that [Koscielny] asked to come off because he\n\ncontinued to bleed a little bit and he didn’t feel comfortable moving.”\n\nAlthough Wenger bemoaned the lack of sharpness and creativity in his team, the Arsenal manager was quick to praise Leicester’s spirited performance. Nigel Pearson’s side worked tirelessly to make life uncomfortable for Arsenal but they also played with courage and were prepared to commit players forward.\n\nWith two points from three tough opening fixtures, against Everton, Chelsea and Arsenal, Pearson is entitled to be pleased with the way that his players have acquitted themselves so far.\n\nLeicester may have had even more to show for their efforts here but Ulloa, set up by the lively Riyad Mahrez, could only find the side netting after sitting Chambers on his backside early in the second half.\n\nAt the other end of the pitch Aaron Ramsey headed tamely into the hands of Schmeichel after Santi Cazorla’s wonderful pitching wedge of a pass – the Spaniard delivered a similar ball in the lead up to Sánchez’s goal – and Sanogo shot straight at the Leicester keeper.\n\nIt was that sort of day for Arsenal.\n\nMan of the match Riyad Mahrez (Leicester City)"}, {"date": "30/08/2014", "arena": "Turf Moor", "attendance": 21099,

We have played well in all of our games and that gives us hope.”\n\nUnited’s shape looked better at Turf Moor, as if a few days of concentrated revision at the training ground had ironed out the wrinkles that were all too apparent at MK Dons. The three centre-backs stationed themselves across the width of the pitch, rather than huddling together nervously in the middle, and wing-backs Antonio Valencia and Ashley Young took the halfway line as their starting position and ventured forward at every chance.\n\nDi María played inside and slightly further forward of Young on the left, which may not prove to be his most effective position but at least allowed him to be involved in some promising attacks on his debut. The first thing the newcomer saw was Tyler Blackett pass straight into touch when he had indicated Young was available to take the ball, quickly followed by the sight of David Jones thumping a shot against David de Gea’s crossbar from a free-kick, but after that unpromising start United settled down to play some composed football.\n\nDi María impressed with the range and accuracy of his passing rather than his running with the ball. He picked out Robin van Persie with a crisply delivered diagonal ball, only for the striker to be denied by Tom Heaton’s reaction save. Five minutes later his low cross from the left should have seen Juan Mata open the scoring, yet with only Heaton to beat from close to the penalty spot, the Spain player trod on the ball and ended up on the floor. Perhaps best of all in the first half was a precision pass over the top for Rooney, who knew he had Van Persie in support and attempted a first-time lay off. Van Persie could not quite elude the defence but United had already shown more attacking flair than they had managed in their last couple of games put together.\n\nThe only slight problem, with the game still scoreless, was that Burnley had attacking ideas too. Another powerful Jones shot from the edge of the area was tipped over the bar by De Gea, meaning that the visiting keeper had now made more saves than the home one, then 10 minutes before the interval the excellent Scott Arfield skipped neatly past Blackett to cut inside for a shot that Phil Jones did well to block.\n\nSomeone commented at half-time that it had been an entertaining 45 minutes between two well-matched teams. True enough, though whether you were flattered or worried by that assessment probably depended upon which end of the ground you were seated. To their credit, the United fans in the Fishwick Stand kept up a constant barrage of supportive noise throughout the game.\n\nIf the travelling supporters were hoping for some tweak or subtle improvement from Van Gaal for the second half they were disappointed. United resumed flatter and less coherent than they had been, allowing Burnley to come at them for the first 15 minutes, although Dean Marney was required to clear a Van Persie effort off the line after an hour following persistence on the left from Di María. The £60m capture left the field soon after that, not a shock on his English debut, though the United fans must have been fairly dismayed to see Anderson trotting out to take his place. With Mata having a poor game and Rooney constantly misplacing or mistiming his passes, United were becoming becalmed in midfield in the late summer sunshine, and Adnan Januzaj seemed a likelier choice to inject more urgency and invention. “You seem to think Anderson is a defensive midfielder, a No6,” Van Gaal said, jokingly. “Perhaps you could inform him that, because he thinks he is a No10.”\n\nMatt Taylor shot narrowly over from a free-kick to remind United that Burnley might not be satisfied with just a point, before Rooney headed wide from a corner and Mata summed up his day and United’s by blazing high over the bar when the ball broke to him in the area off Danny Welbeck. United could have had a penalty in the closing stages, when Ashley Barnes appeared to block Young’s shot with his hands, but Chris Foy gave him the benefit of the doubt.\n\nPlaying the way they did, United would not have deserved such a lucky break anyway. Burnley were deserving of a point. The sight of Paul Scholes on the touchline on BT duty at the end prompted a chorus of “he scores goals” from the United faithful. Touching, but it is about time someone else took a turn."}, {"date": "30/08/2014", "arena": "Etihad Stadium", "attendance": 45622, "home_team": {"name": "Manchester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Joe Hart", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bacary Sagna", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Vincent Kompany", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martín Demichelis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aleksandar Kolarov", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Samir Nasri", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [63]}, {"name": "Fernando", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [38]}, {"name": "Yaya Touré", "yellows": [87], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Silva", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stevan Jovetic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [63]}, {"name": "Sergio Agüero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Pablo Zabaleta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Milner", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Edin Dzeko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [63], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willy Caballero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jesus Navas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [63], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gael Clichy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fernandinho", "yellows": [53], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [38], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Stoke City", "lineup": [{"name": "Asmir Begovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Bardsley", "yellows": [22], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Shawcross", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marc Wilson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Erik Pieters", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jon Walters", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Glenn Whelan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven N'Zonzi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Moses", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [80]}, {"name": "Mame Biram Diouf", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [58], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Peter Crouch", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Peter Odemwingie", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": [65]}, {"name": "Robert Huth", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marc Muniesa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [80], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marko Arnautovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charlie Adam", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [65], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bojan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Thomas Sorensen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "The last time Mark Hughes oversaw a victory at the Etihad Stadium, he was sacked shortly afterwards. It is safe to say this was not such a bittersweet triumph and, whether or not it constituted revenge, it was certainly a reminder of his prowess to the club that discarded him so unceremoniously.\n\nHughes is now approaching the fifth anniversary of his 2009 dismissal, minutes after Manchester City beat Sunderland 4-3, and when they had already lined up his successor, Roberto Mancini, and if he was miscast as a manager of a super-rich club with vaunting ambition, this was proof that he has often excelled with a lesser budget and a competitive group of players who savour their status as underdogs.\n\nA superlative result was achieved in spectacular style, Mame Biram Diouf running virtually the length of the pitch to score the only goal.\n\nNevertheless, earthier values were as important for Stoke City. Brilliantly configured by Hughes, they defended staunchly throughout. Manchester City, who had scored 99 times in just 30 home games under Manuel Pellegrini, were frustrated. As the champions had won 23 of their previous 26 league matches at the Etihad Stadium, this was both a startling scoreline and, for Stoke, a deserved one.\n\nPredictably, Hughes rejected talk this was particularly gratifying to defeat his former club. “I have no axe to grind,” said the man whom City axed. “I am just delighted for my team and our fans. They have enjoyed a fantastic goal and a great performance.”\n\nThe manner of the win was especially pleasing. One suggestion was that Stoke dragged the champions down to their level but that was manifestly unfair on their performance. There was much to admire about their organisation and commitment, the rumbustious running of Diouf, the deft touch of Peter Crouch and the willingness of their defensive colleagues to swarm around a flair player posing dangers.\n\nMeanwhile, Pellegrini’s side laboured in uncharacteristically ineffective fashion. “We didn’t play well in a creative way,” the Chilean conceded. His side were at their seductive best only once, on the stroke of half-time.\n\nSergio Agüero darted into the penalty area, drawing a crowd of defenders to him, and released Aleksandar Kolarov with a backheel. The left-back took the right option, finding Yaya Touré, who struck the bar.\n\nOtherwise, this was the antithesis of their expert dissection of Liverpool on Monday. Pellegrini’s side were strangely blunt. They were flat, with Stevan Jovetic enduring an anticlimactic afternoon, five days after he was the match-winner with a brace against one of their title rivals. Even the normally impeccable David Silva overhit a pass, which happens about as often as his side lose at home. “These games always happen once a year,” Pellegrini said. “It happened today.”\n\nHe believed they should have had a late reprieve, when Touré claimed a penalty as Erik Pieters challenged. To Pellegrini’s irritation, the Ivorian was booked for diving. “It was a clear penalty,” he said. Nevertheless, the referee Lee Mason was consistent in his reluctance to point to the spot. Diouf had been tripped by Kolarov just inside the home penalty area. “I saw the one we should have had in the first half,” Hughes said. “They even themselves out so we would have won anyway.”\n\nThe early alarm was a warning sign that Pellegrini’s team were struggling to halt Diouf legally and his first Stoke goal came as an inadvertent result of the hosts’ pressure. One penalty area was packed and the other was almost deserted when Stoke cleared a corner as far as Diouf, lurking just outside the 18-yard box. The Senegalese ran a further 80 yards, brushing off Kolarov and nutmegging Fernandinho, the last defender, before sliding a shot past Joe Hart for a magnificent solo goal. “Outstanding,” said Hughes. Pellegrini was predictably less impressed. “It was too easy the way they scored on a counterattack,” he argued.\n\nIt was a goal the beleaguered half of Manchester could enjoy. Manager Hughes and defenders Phil Bardsley and Ryan Shawcross all have Manchester United on their CVs. The scorer Diouf, brought in from Hannover to add an extra dimension to the attack, is a fourth Old Trafford old boy, having spent two and a half years there between July 2009 and January 2012.\n\n“When you are a striker you want to make an impression as soon as possible and that means scoring goals,” Hughes added. “We could see he was going to give us something we didn’t have last year, which was pace and power on the break.”\n\nMeanwhile, Pellegrini shrugged off suggestions City could make a late move for a rather more costly striker, Monaco’s £54m Colombian Radamel Falcao, who was not involved in his current club’s match against Lille on Saturday and has been strongly linked with a transfer away. “Just rumours,” he said. It is his standard response to such speculation, but the result that preceded it was distinctly unusual."}, {"date": "30/08/2014", "arena": "St James' Park, Newcastle", "attendance": 49226, "home_team": {"name": "Newcastle United", "lineup": [{"name": "Tim Krul", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daryl Janmaat", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [37], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [79]}, {"name": "Mike Williamson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [88], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fabricio Coloccini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Massadio Haidara", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Moussa Sissoko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Colback", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rémy Cabella", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Siem de Jong", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [79]}, {"name": "Yoan Gouffran", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [67]}, {"name": "Emmanuel Riviere", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Vurnon Anita", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [79], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rolando Aarons", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [73], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [67], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ayoze Pérez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [79], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rob Elliot", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gabriel Obertan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Taylor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paul Dummett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Crystal Palace", "lineup": [{"name": "Julian Speroni", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adrian Mariappa", "yellows": [41], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Scott Dann", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Damien Delaney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Kelly", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jason Puncheon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [48], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mile Jedinak", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joel Ward", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yannick Bolasie", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [83]}, {"name": "Marouane Chamakh", "yellows": [44], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [52]}, {"name": "Dwight Gayle", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [1], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [70]}], "subs": [{"name": "Wilfried Zaha", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [90], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [70], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Brede Hangeland", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fraizer Campbell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [52], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wayne Hennessey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Glenn Murray", "yellows": [88], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [83], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonny Williams", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Barry Bannan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "It was the sort of breathless, blink-and-you’ll-miss-something afternoon that raised far more questions than it answered. For instance, was this deserved point proof that Crystal Palace’s decision to bring back Neil Warnock as manager is a masterstroke? Did Rolando Aarons’s thrillingly incisive contribution, after stepping off the substitutes’ bench, confirm that he is the most gifted product of Newcastle United’s academy in decades?\n\nAre Louis van Gaal and Manchester United already regretting allowing Wilfried Zaha to return to Palace on a season-long loan in the wake of his fabulous stoppage-time equaliser? Perhaps most pertinently, does this latest failure to win at home mean time is finally running out for Alan Pardew on Tyneside?\n\nOne thing is definite: Warnock is relishing his second honeymoon with Palace. “At 5am, and then half an hour before kick-off, I wondered what I was doing,” he said, jokingly. “But I’m loving being back, this job just feels right.”\n\nIt took his team 31 seconds to take the lead. When Marouane Chamakh’s shot was fumbled by the keeper, Tim Krul, the excellent Dwight Gayle pounced on the rebound, using his left foot to divert the ball into the back of the net from close range.\n\nNewcastle could soon have fallen further behind had Jason Puncheon not shot a fraction too high after connecting with Yannick Bolasie’s clever assist. Shortly afterwards came the first chants of “Hatem Ben Arfa” from home fans questioning why Pardew’s most talented player continues to languish in the club’s deep freeze, exiled from any first-team involvement.\n\nEffectively closing his ears to this message, Pardew shook his head and muttered to himself before turning sharply on his heels and swapping his technical area for the sanctuary of the dug-out.\n\nHe desperately needed some slick attacking action to distract the crowd, but little was forthcoming until Moussa Sissoko shot narrowly, and powerfully, wide at the end of an exhilarating counter-attack.\n\nNo matter; the moment when a Newcastle player would score for the first time this season – their goal in the 1-0 League Cup win at Gillingham had been registered unintentionally by the home side’s John Egan – was fast approaching.\n\nIt arrived after Daryl Janmaat, the Holland right-back, unleashed a left-foot shot from close range after intelligent approach play from Rémy Cabella and Emmanuel Rivière. Even so, it required extra assistance in the form of a deflection off Martin Kelly to ensure the ball found itself on an unstoppable flight-path past Julian Speroni.\n\nUnfortunately for Pardew, Warnock had clearly remembered how to deliver a galvanising half-time homily and, after being cued up by Bolasie, Puncheon’s audacious, technically sublime, Fabricio Coloccini-evading volley flew beyond Krul.\n\nIt highlighted the dawning realisation that Newcastle’s expensive summer signings – Siem de Jong and Rivière especially – were taking time to adjust to the Premier League, but mercifully for Pardew he was able to liberate Aarons from the bench. As confident as they come, Aarons is a swashbuckling left-winger who delighted in running at Palace’s defence. He is not bad in the air either and proved the point by heading Cabella’s corner home to equalise.\n\nThe 18-year-old might have relieved the pressure on his manager – not to mention secured all three points – had his gloriously dipping, swerving, tightly angled shot, dispatched after a cute one-two with Massadio Haïdara, not floated inches wide of the far post.\n\nNot about to settle for a point, he further mollified the home crowd’s mood by skinning Adrian Mariappa and delivering an angled chip that was centimetres away from crossing the line before rebounding off the bar. If Palace sensed a momentary reprieve, such hope was extinguished when Mike Williamson prodded the rebound in from close range.\n\nUnfortunately for Newcastle, there were seven minutes of stoppage time – just long enough for Zaha, who had already come mighty close to scoring, to emphasise that he was not about to be upstaged by Aarons.\n\nBy way of regaining the limelight, Zaha met a wonderfully cushioned downward header on the volley, lashing the ball past Krul as, across in the technical area, Warnock jumped up and down like Zebedee, punching thin air with both fists.\n\n“Palace wasted so much time at free-kicks and injuries that I couldn’t believe the referee gave seven minutes stoppage time,” said Pardew. “But it shouldn’t take away from the fact that we should have won – and we didn’t.”"}, {"date": "30/08/2014", "arena": "Kiyan Prince Foundation Stadium", "attendance": 17930, "home_team": {"name": "Queens Park Rangers", "lineup": [{"name": "Robert Green", "yellows":

reality-biting expectation around Loftus Road, after a complex start to the season, most of the pre-match talk around the ground was bleak: never mind a win or a draw, even a goal would do as something to cling to. Not only did a tense encounter deliver that all-important goal, Charlie Austin’s strike was enough to secure a precious three points to help relaunch QPR’s campaign.\n\nIt was Austin’s first in the Premier League, the culmination of a Rickie Lambert-esque clamber up the football ladder from non-league to the elite division. Having been released by Reading as a teenager, the striker spent two years further down the pyramid, before beginning the serious stages of his climb.\n\nA regular scorer in the Championship, this step felt momentous, and Harry Redknapp is hopeful Austin can follow the example of some famous forwards of old. “A lot of strikers have come out of the lower leagues: Les Ferdinand, Ian Wright, Ian Rush. I’m sure Charlie will score at this level.”\n\nHe will need to, particularly as Loïc Rémy, who had been selected for the game, was withdrawn when Redknapp received a phone call confirming that Chelsea had met his £10.5m release clause. “A spanner was thrown in works at 12pm, getting a call saying Loïc was leaving. It was a massive shock to me,” said the QPR manager. The waters were muddied tonight by reports that Arsenal had also met the release clause.\n\nReacting to the Remy news was only part of the reshuffle. The other notable change was in strategy, as QPR abandoned the three-at-the-back experiment that had wreaked such confusion in earlier matches and reverted to a more conventional back four. It seemed a case of systems schmystems early on, though, as Sunderland threatened on a handful of occasions. Patrick van Aanholt and Steven Fletcher both went close.\n\nQPR awoke from their toothless slumber when, from nowhere, Leroy Fer – who impressed on his debut – slammed in a shot from almost 30 yards out that walloped against the crossbar. Gus Poyet sensed the dynamic change. “I don’t know if it was over-confidence, if it was that we were so happy and controlling the game that we thought maybe it was a little bit too easy,” he pondered.\n\nAustin delivered with his third attempt in quick succession. His persistence was rewarded when Fer nodded a corner into his path, and the 25-year-old lashed the ball into the roof of the Sunderland net. “Goals are very expensive, and that made the difference,” Poyet rued.\n\nRedknapp’s team may not be perfectly formed yet – and no doubt the annual car-window interviews will punctuate transfer deadline day on Monday (Lassana Diarra’s transfer should be completed imminently). But as they are, they could be pleased with their second half in terms of effort and resilience. Connor Wickham, Adam Johnson and Emanuele Giaccherini tested the Rangers rearguard, which held firm.\n\nPoyet, too, has work ahead to bolster his resources. “It’s not my squad,” he said. “We are not enough. I am going to be on the phone all the time.”\n\nSuch is the beautiful illogic of football that QPR – who lost their first two Premier League games in underwhelming fashion while Redknapp juggles to try to create a more balanced squad – travel to Old Trafford next, sitting above Manchester United in the budding Premier League table. Something to build on.\n\n“Like everything in life, when you are down you have to pick yourself up,” said Redknapp. “It is how you react to disappointments that proves who you are. We did that.\n\n“I said to the lads the world will look a better place if we win, and it does.”"}, {"date": "30/08/2014", "arena": "The Liberty Stadium", "attendance": 20318, "home_team": {"name": "Swansea City", "lineup": [{"name": "Lukasz Fabianski", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Angel Rangel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordi Amat", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Williams", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Neil Taylor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sung-Yueng Ki", "yellows": [73], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonjo Shelvey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [84]}, {"name": "Nathan Dyer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [2, 71], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gylfi Sigurdsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wayne Routledge", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [24], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [66]}, {"name": "Wilfried Bony", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [76]}], "subs": [{"name": "Tom Carroll", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [84], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bafétimbi Gomis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [76], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dwight Tiendalli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jefferson Montero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [66], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gerhard Tremmel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jazz Richards", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Federico Fernandez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "West Bromwich Albion", "lineup": [{"name": "Ben Foster", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andre Wisdom", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Craig Dawson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonas Olsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jason Davidson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [72]}, {"name": "Saido Berahino", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Craig Gardner", "yellows": [62], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Youssouf Mulumbu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Brunt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [72]}, {"name": "Graham Dorrans", "yellows": [27], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Brown Ideye", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Chris Baird", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Claudio Yacob", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Morrison", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [72], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Boaz Myhill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cristian Gamboa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [72], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gareth McAuley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stéphane Sessegnon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Exultant Swansea fans go into the international break proclaiming “We’re gonna win the league” after their best start to a season since 1923. It won’t happen, of course, but if they can maintain their 100% record when they resume away to Chelsea on 13 September we will all need to reassess their potential.\n\nRoy Hodgson, the England manager, should be doing so already in the cases of Nathan Dyer, whose two goals here gave him three in as many games, and Jonjo Shelvey, who is in imperious form in midfield.\n\nGarry Monk believes both deserve to be in the squad for Wednesday’s friendly against Norway, but was not surprised by their omission. He said: “You have to be watched to get selected and as far as I know Roy has never been here.”\n\nSwansea won even more convincingly than the scoreline would suggest. They would not have been flattered by a five-goal margin, such was their complete superiority over a West Brom team who needed penalties to see off League Two Oxford in the Capital One Cup in midweek.\n\nAlbion avoided relegation by a single place last time and with two points from their first three games they need their unequalled array of new signings to settle in quickly if it is not to be another winter of discontent at the Hawthorns.\n\nThe Swans’ flying start to the season continued in more ways than one. They took the lead after only 88 seconds after a typically incisive passing move, which saw Dyer, Wilfried Bony and Gylfi Sigurdsson combine with classy cohesion on the right The attack culminated in Dyer working a smart one-two with Sigurdsson, whose intelligence and perception was at the root of all three goals. On this occasion the Icelander’s clever backheel played in Dyer, who still had plenty to do. His finish, from right to left, was executed with the skill and accuracy of an international player, which on current form he should be.\n\nIt was going to take something remarkable to eclipse that and Wayne Routledge managed it midway through the first half. Positioned on the edge of the D, he fastened on to Craig Dawson’s attempt to clear Sigurdsson’s cross and went into contortionist mode to get his body in the right shape to beat Ben Foster with a stunning volley into the goalkeeper’s left-hand corner.\n\nAt 2-0 the issue was effectively settled. Alan Irvine, Albion’s new manager, said: “I spent time in the dressing room before the game talking about the importance of getting a good start, and we got the worst possible one. Before we knew it we were 2-0 down.”\n\nNobody made more signings during the summer than West Brom – it will be 11 when Sebastián Blanco, the Argentinian winger, completes his £1.6m move from Metalist Kharkiv. However, not many are deemed ready for action yet and Georgios Samaras, from Celtic, and Silvestre Varela, from Porto, are among those working to improve their fitness.\n\nMuch is expected of Brown Ideye, the club record £10m recruit from Dynamo Kiev. The Nigerian striker had been disappointing on his first two appearances and he was anonymous again, although in mitigation his team-mates were so poor that he was denied proper service. When he did get a shooting chance, his response was little better than a back pass.\n\nIrvine said Ideye, too, was not ready, his preparations for the season interrupted by the situation in Ukraine, and that he played only because Victor Anichebe was injured.\n\nWest Brom improved in the second half but had left themselves with too much to do and Dyer, set up by Àngel Rangel and Sigurdsson, scored his second after 71 minutes when firing low past Foster’s outstretched leg from 15 yards."}, {"date": "30/08/2014", "arena": "Upton Park", "attendance": 34907, "home_team": {"name": "West Ham

beating West Ham United 3-1 at Upton Park.\n\nThe France midfielder – who had been linked with a move to join the former Saints manager Mauricio Pochettino at Tottenham Hotspur – produced a couple of fine close-range efforts either side of half-time as the visitors came from behind following Mark Noble’s deflected effort.\n\nGraziano Pellè, signed for £8m from Koeman’s old club Feyenoord, wrapped things up with seven minutes left. That sparked a rush to the exits for the home fans, following a second home defeat in a week for Sam Allardyce whose team were knocked out of the Capital One Cup on penalties by the League One side Sheffield United.\n\nSouthampton, who won at Millwall in the cup, started brightly as Pellè and Shane Long, a £12m signing from Hull, stretched the Hammers’ defence.\n\nWest Ham paraded their new loan signing Alex Song, the former Arsenal man joining from Barcelona, before kick-off, but took time to get into any sort of passing rhythm against the well-organised Saints.\n\nIt was 20 minutes before the home side were able to create an opening. A free-kick from Stewart Downing was only half cleared, with the ball dropping back to the far post through a crowded six-yard box where Ricardo Vaz Tê turned it goalwards. However, Fraser Forster somehow made a reaction save at point-blank range to push the ball wide across the face of goal.\n\nThere was, though, little the former Celtic goalkeeper could do a few moments later to prevent West Ham taking the lead in the 27th minute. Noble robbed Schneiderlin and drove towards the edge of the Saints penalty area. He let fly from 25 yards, with the ball deflecting off the boot of Maya Yoshida and into the far corner, just out of Forster’s reach.\n\nSouthampton looked to make a quick response, with a deep cross from the left glanced down by Pellè, which Aaron Cresswell guided off the line.\n\nTo their credit, the visitors continued to stay composed despite now having to chase the match, with West Ham dropping an extra man into a packed midfield to compensate.\n\nPellè missed his kick when the Serbian midfielder Dusan Tadic found space on the left for another dangerous cross into the West Ham penalty area, which Winston Reid gratefully cleared.\n\nSchneiderlin showed the Italian how it should be done when he equalised on the stroke of half-time. A free-kick on the left touchline was floated in by Tadic and flicked on to the far post, where Schneiderlin drilled it back goalwards. Although Joey O’Brien made a brave block, Schneiderlin latched on to the rebound and curled it inside the far post.\n\nSaints went close to taking the lead at the start of the second half when a shot by Long at the edge of the penalty area was turned behind by Adrián. Tadic then had the West Ham goalkeeper scrambling down to his right with a low shot from 18 yards, and Schneiderlin crashed the ball over from 10 yards following the corner.\n\nSaints had the ball in the net again when Pellè converted a free-kick from James Ward-Prowse at the far post, but was one of three players offside.\n\nAllardyce had seen enough and made a double change on the hour, as Ravel Morrison and Mohamed Diamé replaced Mauro Zárate and Vaz Tê.\n\nIt was no surprise when Schneiderlin put the Saints ahead midway through the second half. A short corner caught West Ham asleep, with a cross from Ward-Prowse flicked home at the near post by the French midfielder, who wheeled away to celebrate in front of the away fans behind the goal.\n\nWest Ham needed inspiration from somewhere, and £12m Ecuador forward Enner Valencia was sent on with 11 minutes left, replacing the ineffective Carlton Cole. However, Southampton made sure of the victory in the 83rd minute when Pellè smashed home after Adrian had palmed out a cross from right-back Nathaniel Clyne.\n\nThe boos rang out around the Boleyn

two sides shared five goals in 10 minutes certainly did not feel like the orthodox Mourinho experience. It incorporated a goal from Samuel Eto’o against his former club and, in brief passages, the gathering sense that Chelsea were straying dangerously close to being caught by persistent opponents. Instead, it ended up as a rout, with Diego Costa at the heart of it and ironic cries of “boring, boring Chelsea” from the away end.\n\nBoring? Costa will probably think he should have scored a hat-trick, bearing in mind he had also run clear of Everton’s defence just before that blitz of second-half goals. Everton, too, had plenty of chances to add more goals of their own. Mourinho could probably be forgiven for thinking his team should have made it a more routine victory considering the two-goal head start Costa and Branislav Ivanovic had given them inside the opening three minutes. Yet Everton, even in defeat, deserve a measure of acclaim for the way they tried everything to repair the damage. It was just a pity for Roberto Martínez that his team’s defending was so abysmal.\n\nChelsea began like a team in a hurry. They attacked with a vibrancy that was too much for their opponents and they always made sure they had the final say when Everton kept coming back at them. Amid the blizzard of goals, it should not be forgotten either that Everton, already 2-0 down and looking in need of smelling salts, could have been down to 10 men inside the opening 10 minutes. Tim Howard, running from his goalline to cut out a long pass for Eden Hazard, was a good yard outside his area when he handled the ball, in keeping with a day when there was seldom anything but panic in the home side’s defence.\n\nThe last time they conceded six at Goodison came against Arsenal in August 2009. Cesc Fábregas was playing for the opposition that day, too. He was excellent here but then so were Nemanja Matic and Ramires alongside him in midfield. Costa had a running argument with Séamus Coleman and then Howard and took out his anger with his goals. His place had been in doubt because of a hamstring issue but his right-footed finish, after 35 seconds, was an early way of letting everyone know he was functioning perfectly well. He lasted the full match and his second goal, to complete the scoring, was another reminder that Chelsea now have a striker suitable for a club of their ambitions. Fernando Torres, we can safely say, was not missed.\n\nEverton were entitled to be aggrieved about Ivanovic’s goal because he had been in a marginally offside position when he controlled Ramires’s pass and fired in his shot. The offside flag did then go up, correctly, when Romelu Lukaku headed a corner against the crossbar and Sylvain Distin squeezed the rebound over the line. That was in the 17th minute and perhaps the moment when Everton did realise they could trouble their opponents.\n\nThey showed commendable spirit for the rest of the first half and their energy, particularly on the right, was rewarded just before the break when Kevin Mirallas headed in Coleman’s cross. Martínez later described Everton’s attacking as “phenomenal”. Yet he was at a loss to understand what had gone wrong in their defence. “We probably had 1,100 Premier League appearances in that back five,” he said.\n\nMourinho was also unhappy, albeit to a lesser extent, pointing out that he had spent an entire training session on Wednesday working for 90 minutes solid on his team’s defence and, in hindsight, he “should have stayed at home with my wife”. Yet there was one crucial difference: Chelsea made mistakes for Everton’s goals; Everton made them all afternoon.\n\nChelsea’s third goal came from a Hazard cross that Coleman deflected into his own net and that was the moment Costa apparently said something to taunt the Everton defender, bringing an incensed Howard out of his goalmouth to confront him. Costa had already been booked after ignoring the referee Jon Moss’s instructions to stop tangling with Coleman at a free-kick. Howard was shown a yellow card and for the rest of the match Costa seemed intent on prolonging the argument with Everton’s goalkeeper. Mourinho, one imagines, appreciates the devil in his new signing, even if it does hint at trouble ahead.\n\nAiden McGeady set up Steven Naismith to poke in Everton’s second goal a minute after that flashpoint and, once again, the home crowd dared to think the comeback might be on. Chelsea wasted little time disappointing them, Matic restoring the two-goal advantage with a left-foot drive from 20 yards. It was starting to feel difficult to keep up when Eto’o headed in Leighton Baines’s free-kick to make it 4-3 but Matic played in Ramires to fire in their fourth goal and then a poor backheel from Muhamed Besic left the home defence vulnerable again. Mikel showed him how to do it, leaving Costa running clear before taking the ball around Howard to complete the scoring."}, {"date": "25/08/2014", "arena": "Etihad Stadium", "attendance": 45471,

the second half and a few seconds after Sergio Agüero, one of the more formidable strikers in the industry, had run on to the field as a substitute. Agüero’s first touch was to control a through-ball from Jesús Navas and his second put it past Simon Mignolet as though it were the most normal thing in the world. What a way to introduce himself and what a devastating reminder of Manchester City’s extra quality.\n\nStevan Jovetic had already provided a couple of his own reminders with the opening goals on the night City joined Chelsea, Tottenham Hotspur and Swansea City in starting the season with back-to-back wins.\n\nLiverpool had actually matched the champions for long periods and Balotelli, from his vantage point in the Colin Bell stand, might still have been left with the impression they are a better team now than in his last spell in English football. Yet this also was the first occasion when it became clear how much Liverpool might miss the penetrative qualities of Luis Suárez. The away side had plenty of the ball.\n\nThey made every kind of pass, indeed, apart from the killer one. They had been the better side until Jovetic’s first goal, five minutes before the break, but they never played with the menace that was associated with Liverpool last season and did not threaten Joe Hart’s goal with any sustained momentum until a header from their substitute, Rickie Lambert, came back off the goalkeeper and went in off Pablo Zabaleta seven minutes from the end.\n\nIt was typical of Brendan Rodgers’ team that, briefly, they still thought they could complete a late comeback but it was always unrealistic and almost out of the question when Glen Johnson went off with a groin injury, leaving them with only 10 players on the field. Liverpool’s manager had already used his three substitutes and City withheld an initial flurry before seeing out the final exchanges without too much trouble.\n\nPellegrini’s team have started the season as if they mean business and it must be ominous for their rivals that he admitted afterwards the champions had not fully clicked. Yaya Touré did not look his usual commanding self, much like his performance at Newcastle on the opening weekend. Edin Dzeko had a frustrating night before taking a kick to the thigh, paving the way for Agüero to replace him, and Liverpool must have been slightly bemused that they could find themselves 3-0 behind when few visiting teams to this stadium have so much of the ball.\n\nStevan Jovetic opens the scoring. Photograph: Greg Kwasnik/Greg Kwasnik/Focus Images Ltd\n\nUnfortunately for them it was their defending that let them down last season and this defeat was another reminder that they cannot be so loose at the back. Jovetic’s first goal was a particular ordeal for Liverpool’s new left-back, Alberto Moreno, and Dejan Lovren, another of their summer signings, will not enjoy the replays of Agüero’s goal. “We have to be tighter than that, get up to people,” Rodgers said. “They were poor goals.”\n\nFor Liverpool there was an element of déjà vu about what went wrong. “You can spend as much money as you like, it doesn’t guarantee you anything,” Rodgers added.\n\nJovetic’s first season in Manchester was almost written off by injuries but his talent has never been in question and it was an emphatic right-foot shot he struck beneath Mignolet for the first goal. Yet Rodgers was entitled to be aggrieved by the defending. Lovren had nodded the ball away from David Silva and the only requirement for Moreno was to get his clearance out of the penalty area. It was a lazy swing of his left boot that allowed the alert Jovetic to pinch the ball.\n\nUntil that point City had struggled to get behind the visiting defence. Liverpool started the game with a good structure and, much like their visit to this stadium last season, no sense whatsoever of being overcome by caution. City’s home record over the last three seasons incorporates only three defeats but Rodgers always sets up his side to take the game to the opposition and that meant Zabaleta and Gaël Clichy, City’s overlapping full-backs, were reluctant to break forward as much as usual.\n\nClichy, in particular, had to worry about the pace and directness of Raheem Sterling but one of City’s great strengths is the way they gang up on the opposition full-backs in wide positions and it was noticeable that when Zabaleta did start venturing forward more regularly it helped Jovetic to his second goal, turning in Samir Nasri’s pass from the right.\n\nFor Liverpool Daniel Sturridge was denied a goal for offside early in the second half and could also reflect on their most inviting chance of the opening period, when he eluded Vincent Kompany but could not get his shot past Hart. Philippe Coutinho and Sterling faded and the bottom line was that Liverpool did not have the same threat without Suárez. Balotelli, according to Rodgers, is a “calculated risk”. It is easier now to understand why he has taken it."}, {"date": "24/08/2014", "arena": "KCOM Stadium", "attendance": 24348, "home_team": {"name": "Hull City", "lineup": [{"name": "Allan McGregor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Curtis Davies", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Chester", "yellows": [], "reds": [14], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paul McShane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ahmed Elmohamady", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jake Livermore", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Huddlestone", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stephen Quinn", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [76]}, {"name": "Andrew Robertson", "yellows": [51], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Ince", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [56]}, {"name": "Nikica Jelavic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [42], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [81]}], "subs": [{"name": "Liam Rosenior", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [56], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Maynor Figueroa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex Bruce", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Meyler", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [76], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "George Boyd", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [81], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steve Harper", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sone Aluko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Stoke City", "lineup": [{"name": "Asmir Begovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Bardsley", "yellows": [44], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Shawcross", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [83], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marc Wilson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Erik Pieters", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steve Sidwell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [65]}, {"name": "Glenn Whelan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [41]}, {"name": "Peter Odemwingie", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven N'Zonzi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marko Arnautovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [55]}, {"name": "Mame Biram Diouf", "yellows": [38], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Marc Muniesa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charlie Adam", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [65], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jon Walters", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Geoff Cameron", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Peter Crouch", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [55], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bojan", "yellows": [61], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [41], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Thomas Sorensen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "The Hull City manager, Steve Bruce, expects to wrap up the protracted signing of Michael Dawson from Tottenham Hotspur this week. Bruce has been chasing the 30-year-old defender for most of the summer and the £3m transfer should brighten his mood after watching his side denied what would have been an admirable victory over Stoke City.\n\nHull protected their goal for 69 minutes with 10 players after the 14th-minute dismissal of their defender James Chester. A goal on the break from Nikica Jelavic had Tigers fans crossing their fingers for a second successive victory in the Premier League for the first time since September last year, but Ryan Shawcross ruined it.\n\nThe Stoke captain claimed an 83rd-minute equaliser that came with the help of the post and the goal decision system. Bruce, however, was more perturbed by a decision that came in the moments before the goal when Stoke were awarded a throw-in he was sure his side should have been given.\n\n“We feel an injustice because you can see how blatant it is,” Bruce said. “I just cannot understand how the three officials can’t get together and make that decision right. The whole of the crowd knew what it was, their player ran away and didn’t want to even take the throw-in.\n\n“Surely that’s an indication to the referee or the officials to say ‘hang on a minute, it must have hit him’. It wasn’t even a slight deflection either. Everyone in the ground must have seen it except for the three officials.”\n\nA mistake from Allan McGregor cost the Tigers on Thursday in the Europa League when they were beaten 1-0 by Lokeren in Belgium and the condition must be catching.\n\nThis time three team-mates in front of the Scotland goalkeeper combined to give Hull a disadvantage in the 14th minute. Paul McShane’s pass to Jake Livermore was practically uncontrollable and the stabbed pass backwards was intercepted by Glenn Whelan, bursting forward from midfield. Chester lunged in a split second too late, Whelan went down and Chester went off. The referee, Jon Moss, had little choice.\n\nHull switched from 3-5-2 to 4-4-1 and immediately embarked on Operation Frustration and it very nearly worked. Stoke committed numbers forward but lacked invention. Steven N’Zonzi, Erik Pieters, Shawcross and Marko Arnautovic all had half-chances and Mark Hughes, the Stoke manager, had seen enough. Bojan Krkic, the summer signing from Barcelona, was sent on to add guile to Stoke’s attack but his first contribution was a timid attempt to block Tom Huddlestone’s shot in the buildup to Hull’s goal in the 42nd minute. Asmir Begovic got a hand to it but Jelavic got to the loose ball before Marc Wilson and slid the ball home from a tight angle.\n\nStoke lost their opening fixture of the season at home to Aston Villa and face the daunting trip to Manchester City on Saturday. Understandably, their desperation to collect a first point of the season intensified.\n\nArnautovic made a mess of a volley at the back post before Shawcross’s low side-footed shot was well gathered by McGregor in the Hull goal. Peter Crouch, on as a substitute, had a shot well blocked by McShane. The ball spun towards Mame Diouf in space but the former Manchester United striker headed well wide.\n\nCharlie Adam was Hughes’s final throw of the dice and his first involvement was to fire in a vicious shot from 25 yards that McGregor did well to push over. Crouch almost capitalised when McGregor pushed Bojan’s cross-shot into his path but the goalkeeper again reacted quickly to snatch away the chance.\n\nIt was starting to look like it would not be Stoke’s day until they got a stroke of fortune with seven minutes left. Bojan’s cross was fired against the post by Phil Bardsley. The ball hit McGregor and Shawcross forced the ball in. The referee waited for the touchline technology to confirm it had crossed the line. The overriding feeling for Hughes was relief.\n\n“We needed to show quality, guile and understanding of what was required and we didn’t do that to a great extent,” said the Stoke manager. “We’re an honest group and we know we can do better than we did. We were a little bit out of sorts but took something out of the game.”\n\nMan of the match Allan McGregor (Hull City)"}, {"date": "24/08/2014", "arena": "White Hart Lane", "attendance": 36109,

dugout at the final whistle, his body language betraying the reality he was considerably more relieved to be departing Tottenham Hotspur this time round. This could not have been an unhappier return for the Queens Park Rangers manager to the club he once took to the Champions League. His current charges were dispatched by a rampant Spurs team relishing life under their latest regime. Glenn Hoddle, Steven Caulker and Bobby Zamora, all former Tottenham men in the visitors’ contingent, must have shared his eagerness to beat a hasty retreat.\n\nThis was a brutal early-season reminder of just how ruthless life can be in the top flight. QPR, awkward in their recent adoption of Hoddle’s favoured system of three centre-halves, had been ripped to shreds by the interval and the restoration of a four-man rearguard thereafter was far too late to salvage anything from this contest. Already three down with a back three, they duly fell four behind with a back four. QPR never stood a chance. The newly promoted side were always vulnerable, out-manoeuvred in midfield and uncertain at the back, as Spurs’ perfect start to the campaign was maintained.\n\nRedknapp wore a haggard look as the thrashing was played out, forever demanding answers from a badgered Kevin Bond at his side as his players wilted out on the pitch. Their season will not be judged on daunting occasions such as these but his little wave to the home support infuriated the visiting support and was ill-conceived and inadequately justified. Indeed, the manner in which his side were overwhelmed from the opening exchanges did not bode well for the months ahead.\n\nQPR must adjust to the upgrade in divisions but so must Tottenham’s players to life under Mauricio Pochettino. It will take the Argentinian time to make this team truly his own – a group that eagerly squeezes the ambition from opponents high up the pitch – but two league games into his tenure as the manager, Spurs sit on top of the league and that frenzy of transfer business conducted last year in anticipation of Gareth Bale’s record sale to Real Madrid is finally starting to feel inspired. Those who had laboured last year appear reborn. Etienne Capoue was commanding at the base of the Tottenham midfield, unflustered yet powerful in disrupting what rhythm the visitors could muster. Nacer Chadli, wandering in-field from the flank and timing his arrival cleverly, contributed two neatly taken goals to celebrate this as a fresh start – and then there was Érik Lamela.\n\nThe Argentinian had made only three Premier League starts last season after his £30m move from AS Roma before injuries – combined with a certain scepticism among the coaching staff – wrecked his chances of making an instantly favourable impression. Yet, having inspired his side to victory in a Europa League qualifying success in Cyprus in midweek, he revelled again.\n\nQPR could not cope with his darts into space, invariably fuelled by the outstanding vision, invention and control of Christian Eriksen at his side, with his delivery sharp and accurate. It was his corner that was flicked beyond Rob Green at the near post by Eric Dier, the young defender following up his winner at West Ham the previous weekend. It was Lamela, too, who centred for Chadli to power down his second of the game and beyond the beleaguered QPR goalkeeper to extend the lead further.\n\nPochettino sees more improvement to come from his compatriot. “It’s true that he could improve a lot [from last year] but he’s still young,” said the manager. “Always, for young players arriving in different countries, different cultures, different football, it’s difficult to adapt but he has all the skills and we’re very happy with him. He played a very good game.” Chadli, too, appeared revived. The Belgian winger, a £7m arrival from Twente a year ago, had paved the way for the result by collecting Emmanuel Adebayor’s centre on his chest early on and, as he fell, guiding a right-footed shot beyond Green.\n\nThe centre had arced over Richard Dunne at the far post, the former Republic of Ireland defender’s discomfort epitomising QPR’s teething troubles with their system. He did not reappear after the interval, Nedum Onuoha dropping in at right-back in a back four, though Spurs were not finished. When Chadli poked Danny Rose free down the left, the full-back’s centre flicked off an anxious Rio Ferdinand on the stretch and was sidefooted home eagerly by Adebayor to register his side’s fourth.\n\nRedknapp’s team had threatened only sporadically, Matt Phillips clipping wastefully over the bar, having wriggled away from Younès Kaboul, and Zamora and Caulker spurning chances to glean consolation. That ensured no one in QPR’s ranks with a Tottenham association could look fondly on this return.\n\n“Getting beat here is no different to getting beat anywhere else,” added the QPR manager before exiting swiftly stage right.\n\nMan of the match Christian Eriksen (Tottenham Hotspur)"}, {"date": "24/08/2014", "arena": "Stadium of Light", "attendance": 43217, "home_team": {"name": "Sunderland",

The songs go to the same tune and in the closing moments, hunting a late winner, there was at least a flickered reminder of the old team. Yet this is not Manchester United as we know them. Not yet, anyway. Louis van Gaal had predicted it would take three months, or maybe even longer, before everything clicked and there were only fleeting moments here when they looked close to getting it right.\n\nThey were fortunate in one respect, that Sunderland did not have more refinement in their own play. The home side were strangely lacking in ambition and really ought to have done more to examine United’s shortcomings after Jack Rodwell’s first goal for the club had put them level with an hour to play. The overwhelming sense was that this was a good time to face Van Gaal’s side.\n\nIn the first half in particular there was plenty of evidence to support Van Gaal’s assertion that United’s self-belief had been “smashed” by the defeat to Swansea City the previous weekend. They did at least start passing the ball with a touch of the old spark after the interval but it was strange that Gus Poyet’s team did not play with more adventure bearing in mind their opponents finished with a makeshift three-man defence featuring Tyler Blackett and Michael Keane.\n\n“It’s a different Manchester United, that’s for sure,” Poyet said. Yet Sunderland, overall, were disappointing, huffing and puffing to the final whistle, and passing up the opportunity to take advantage.\n\nIn the circumstances, Van Gaal’s team coped reasonably well during those passages when Sunderland’s fans must have longed for their team to take control. Even so, it was rare to see a United side move the ball with so little distinction. So many of the qualities that we associate with this club seem to have been placed in temporary storage. They were slow with their thinking and careless with their passing.\n\nDanny Welbeck’s arrival as a second-half substitute gave them some impetus for the final exchanges, when Sunderland suddenly looked so nervous it felt like someone needed to remind them this was not the United of old.\n\nVan Gaal, however, was startled by their general lack of cohesion. “All too slow, all too fast, all too hasty,” he said of their passing. It flattered them greatly when Juan Mata gave them a 17th-minute lead and there was a touch of ignominy attached to the result given that it incorporated another incident to enhance Ashley Young’s reputation as a serial diver. Young received a yellow card for his troubles, accused of trying to con the referee, Martin Atkinson, into awarding a second-half penalty, at the first point of the match when the visitors had started to put their opponents under concerted pressure.\n\nUntil then, United had left the clear impression that Ángel Di María’s impending arrival from Real Madrid will only partly ease their issues. At one point Chris Smalling brought the ball out of defence and then held out his arms in exasperation because of the lack of movement in front of him. Young, inside the opening minute, gave the ball away in his own half and was fortunate Sunderland did not score from it. Tom Cleverley’s carelessness felt stuck on a loop. Robin van Persie looked short of fitness and Santiago Vergini probably took enough of the ball to warrant the benefit of the doubt when United thought they should have won a penalty. That was followed almost immediately by Young spinning over Wes Brown’s challenge. Van Gaal defended his player, Ferguson-style, but there is a long list of previous to suggest why Atkinson thought the worst.\n\nJohn O’Shea, Sunderland’s captain, had presented the ball to Young and that epitomised the slightly desperate way the home side finished the match, hacking the ball out of defence and straying dangerously close to full-on panic. They did not need to fret so much. Lee Cattermole was a driving influence and Will Buckley made a good impression for his new club.\n\nConnor Wickham started on the left, in an unorthodox role, but created plenty of problems for United’s defence in the first half yet, paradoxically, not so much after Keane came on to complete a vulnerable looking defence. Smalling had suffered a groin strain to reinforce the view that he picks up too many injuries to be relied upon. The same suspicion could apply to Jonny Evans and Phil Jones and, once again, it seemed bewildering that United had not done more to strengthen this part of their team. Sunderland really should have tested Keane more.\n\nWhen the away side took the lead, after 17 minutes, it was the first time they had attacked with any real purpose. Antonio Valencia went round Sunderland’s new left-back, Patrick van Aanholt, and his low centre took a slight deflection off Cattermole to help it across the six-yard area. Seb Larsson had allowed Mata to get away from him and the Spaniard applied the finishing touch at the far post.\n\nSunderland were briefly dispirited but kept being encouraged by the mistakes from their opponents.\n\nVan Gaal’s team were always likely to be vulnerable on the left of their defence, via the inexperienced Blackett and the inadequate Young, and the corner for Rodwell’s equaliser came from that side. Larsson swung the ball over and Rodwell eluded Valencia to score with a powerful header.\n\nMan of the match Lee Cattermole (Sunderland)"}, {"date": "23/08/2014", "arena": "Villa Park", "attendance": 30267, "home_team": {"name": "Aston Villa", "lineup": [{"name": "Brad Guzan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alan Hutton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Philippe Senderos", "yellows": [67], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ron Vlaar", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aly Cissokho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [82]}, {"name": "Kieran  Richardson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [76]}, {"name": "Ashley Westwood", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fabian Delph", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charles N'Zogbia", "yellows": [50], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [62]}, {"name": "Gabriel Agbonlahor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andreas Weimann", "yellows": [68], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Carlos Sánchez", "yellows": [85], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [62], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathan Baker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [82], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leandro Bacuna", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Cole", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Darren Bent", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [76], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shay Given", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Grealish", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Newcastle United", "lineup": [{"name": "Tim Krul", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daryl Janmaat", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mike Williamson", "yellows": [86], "reds": [90], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fabricio Coloccini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paul Dummett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Vurnon Anita", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [70]}, {"name": "Jack Colback", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rémy Cabella", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Moussa Sissoko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yoan Gouffran", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Emmanuel Riviere", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [77]}], "subs": [{"name": "Ayoze Pérez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [77], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Siem de Jong", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [70], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Massadio Haidara", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rob Elliot", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gabriel Obertan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Taylor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mehdi Abeid", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "No prizes for guessing where improvement is required in these two teams. On a less than inspiring afternoon in the Midlands, when antics on the touchline provided more entertainment than events on the pitch, Newcastle were denied three points through a combination of Brad Guzan’s goalkeeping and the absence of a cutting edge in front of goal.\n\nAlan Pardew’s side controlled the game in the second half, creating a number of decent chances, but they finished up playing with 10 men, after Mike Williamson picked up a second yellow card in the 90th minute, and departed lamenting their failure to punish an Aston Villa side that was unable to register a shot on target throughout.\n\nAt least Roy Keane found his range. Furious with one of a number of offside decisions that went against Villa in the second half, the assistant manager threw a water bottle from the dugout that hit Paul Lambert where it hurts. Lambert laughed, which was probably a sensible reaction. “You try and tell him to not throw a bottle,” the Villa manager said.\n\nIn the opposite dugout Pardew’s behaviour had already provided a source of amusement. Swaying from side to side and using his fingers to pull a wide grin, the Newcastle manager looked like one of those fathers embarrassing his children on the dancefloor.\n\nIt turned out that he was trying to get the out-of-sorts Rémy Cabella to relax and enjoy his football. “I just felt that he was trying too hard,” Pardew said. “He had a lot of publicity last week and I felt he was a bit tense. He had a couple of great situations and didn’t deliver and that’s not like him, so I was just trying to get him to play with a smile. I thought he was better in the second half.”\n\nPlenty of chances came and went for Newcastle in that period. Daryl Janmaat’s header was tipped over by Guzan, the Dutchman also went close with a left-footed shot and Williamson – the wrong man in the right place – mis-kicked on the corner of the six-yard box. Ayoze Pérez might have done better from a not dissimilar position and Siem de Jong, another late substitute, could have won the game two minutes from time when he broke into the area but shot too close to Guzan. “A lot of good things without the killer touch,” Pardew said. “But I think we’ve got goals in this team.”\n\nLambert believes the same will be true of Villa when Christian Benteke and Libor Kozak are back from long-term injury. Villa showed some promising signs in the first half, with Aly Cissokho and Alan Hutton both breaking forward with intent from the full-back positions. Tim Krul, however, was not exactly overworked; Charles N’Zogbia headed on to the roof of the net and later curled a 25-yard free-kick wide but that was as good as it got for Villa.\n\nLambert, though, was upbeat after seeing his side pick up four points from the opening two matches. “It’s a great start for us,” he said. “After everybody was doom and gloom about the football club towards the end of last season, we’ve certainly took that challenge on.”"}, {"date": "23/08/2014", "arena": "Stamford Bridge", "attendance": 41604, "home_team": {"name": "Chelsea", "lineup": [{"name": "Thibaut

"report": "If Chelsea made slightly heavy weather of victory in their first home Premier League fixture of the season, then there was plenty for José Mourinho to take heart from in a 2-0 defeat of Leicester City pegged out around second-half goals from Diego Costa and Eden Hazard, and a performance that became more convincing as Leicester’s energy levels dropped in the afternoon sun.\n\nThe visitors had looked the more settled team in the first half here, tribute to their own energetic and diligent midfield and also to a general sluggishness in Chelsea’s passing and movement. Afterwards, Mourinho blamed the weather, suggesting that his team of Brazilians and Spaniards had been made “lazy” by the sheer unrelenting heat of an autumnal day in west London. In the event, the end result may have had more to do with Mourinho’s own “emotional” response in the dressing room at half-time. “I told them the way we were playing was not good enough to win the game,” Mourinho said. “In the second half we were much more aggressive. It was good, it was fast, and we made it difficult for them.”\n\nIt is naturally tempting to make light of successive victories against newly promoted teams, but for Chelsea there are still grounds to sniff out signs of progress here. Defeat by Sunderland at home effectively chloroformed last season’s title challenge, and points were also dropped against West Brom, Aston Villa, Crystal Palace and Norwich. Beating the teams you expect to beat isn’t everything in the Premier League. But it’s a pretty good place to start, and it is in this kind of fixture that the added cutting edge of Costa might just make the most obvious difference.\n\nHere, the Brazilian-Spanish west Londoner had a fine match, working tirelessly, Atlético-style, and poaching a vital opening goal. Mourinho, who also confirmed that Fernando Torres would not be leaving in the transfer window, said Costa’s integration at Chelsea had been “no big deal”. “He’s a happy guy, not speaking good English but always communicating. His integration in the team is good, his style of play also adapted to our needs.”\n\nNot that Chelsea had it all their own way, as Leicester again showed themselves resilient travellers. Mourinho’s pre-match utterances are generally best skimmed for the odd word not specifically dedicated to inflammatory falsehoods, but Chelsea’s manager was correct to offer some wary respect for the Football League’s champion club and here, lining up in a tightly knit 4-4-2, Leicester were sharp in the tackle early on, and pacy on the break throughout.\n\nAt times in the first half, the most visible attacker on the pitch was Leicester’s Algerian World Cup winger Riyad Mahrez, who had the first really venomous attempt on goal, after 22 minutes, making space 30 yards out and firing in a low shot that Thibaut Courtois parried away. Moments later, Cesc Fábregas had his best moment of the half, finding André Schürrle on the right and then sprinting between the lines to tee up Oscar for a shot that was deflected over the bar. And that was pretty much that for Chelsea in a first half most notable for the astute positional play of Dean Hammond and Andy King, Leicester’s third and fourth-choice central midfielders.\n\nThere was instant improvement from Chelsea at the start of the second half, with Branislav Ivanovic in particular pushed much farther upfield. First, though, Leicester had their own moment to turn this game. David Nugent might like to look away here. With 53 minutes gone (and moments after Oscar had hit the post at the other end), a pass from Hammond put Nugent in on goal, only for Courtois to make a fine low save with his legs. Moments later, it was Nugent v Courtois II, a better chance drawing a better save as Mahrez bypassed the entire Chelsea midfield with a single pass on the break, Nugent hared in on goal and Chelsea’s goalkeeper sprinted out to hurl himself at his feet and deflect a hesitant shot wide.\n\nAt the other end, Ivanovic continued to rampage down Chelsea’s right, and it was his burst that made the opening goal after 63 minutes. Taking Oscar’s through-pass, Ivanovic cut inside with all the twirling incision of a thunder-thighed Charlie Cooke, leaving both Liam Moore and Jeff Schlupp on their backsides. His pass inside found Costa, who, despite a bobbly touch, was able to prod past Kasper Schmeichel and low into the net.\n\nChelsea continued to press and the second goal duly arrived, on 77 minutes. Hazard cut in from the left, wandered across the penalty area waiting for a challenge and then, almost with a shrug, swept a shot across the goal and into the far corner. As with the first goal, Leicester’s defensive efforts had dipped just for a second; together, those moments were enough to cost them the match."}, {"date": "23/08/2014", "arena": "Selhurst Park", "attendance": 24242, "home_team": {"name": "Crystal Palace", "lineup": [{"name": "Julian Speroni", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Kelly", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Brede Hangeland", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Damien Delaney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joel Ward", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Barry Bannan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [71]}, {"name": "Mile Jedinak", "yellows": [89], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stuart O'Keefe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [83]}, {"name": "Yannick Bolasie", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marouane Chamakh", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [48], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fraizer Campbell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [70]}], "subs": [{"name": "Adrian Mariappa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paddy McCarthy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adlene Guedioura", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wayne Hennessey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dwight Gayle", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [70], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Glenn Murray", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [83], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonny Williams", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [71], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "West Ham United", "lineup": [{"name": "Adrián", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joey O'Brien", "yellows": [75], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Tomkins", "yellows": [45], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Winston Reid", "yellows": [40], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Cresswell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cheikhou Kouyaté", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mark Noble", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stewart Downing", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [37], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Mauro Zárate", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [34], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [83]}, {"name": "Ricardo Vaz Te", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Carlton Cole", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [62], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [68]}], "subs": [{"name": "Ravel Morrison", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Diafra Sakho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [68], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Guy Demel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mohamed Diamé", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jussi Jaaskelainen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Diego Poyet", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [83], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Enner Valencia", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Crystal Palace’s supporters arrived determined to roar their side on and make sure a bad week ended on a happy note. The Palace ultras, that vociferous little group of fans behind one of the goals at Selhurst Park, banged their drums and led the chants and briefly it seemed that everything was going to be all right; it did not matter that Palace have been unwittingly caught up in the Malky Mackay scandal, that their technical director, Iain Moody, has had to resign and that they cannot find a replacement for Tony Pulis. The mood was defiant, Palace had the 12th man and that was going to be the difference.\n\nIt was a nice idea but not a particularly logical one and that early optimism was eventually replaced by frustration and sadness at the dispiriting situation in which Palace find themselves. There were even boos when Keith Millen, the put-upon caretaker manager, substituted Barry Bannan in the second half. Palace are managerless, pointless and only going in one direction unless Steve Parish can convince someone to accept a job that is growing more unattractive with each passing day. There was no movement here. Palace are in limbo and West Ham, inspired by Mauro Zárate, could hardly believe their luck.\n\n“I’m in charge and I don’t like to hide behind excuses, but it’s been a tough week,” Millen said. “When you come to match day you don’t know how they’re going to respond.”\n\nMillen, who is expected to be in charge for Tuesday’s Capital One Cup tie against Walsall, remains in the running for the job but the past week has taken its toll on the side. “We’ve got to speak to the chairman tomorrow,” Millen said. “Everyone knows we need to strengthen the squad. I know from our conversations what he’s looking for. I don’t think today’s performance has any real reflection on myself or my chances.”\n\nWhich is just as well, because Palace were dire. The signs were ominous when they lost Joe Ledley to a groin injury in the warm-up, the defence was disorganised without Scott Dann and the absence of the suspended Jason Puncheon robbed them of one of their most dangerous players.\n\nPalace did start brightly, twice threatening to score in the opening 15 minutes, but soon faded and West Ham were powerful and dominant at a ground where they had not won for 23 years.\n\nSam Allardyce is often criticised for West Ham’s predictability yet the absence of Kevin Nolan, who is expected to be out for six weeks with a shoulder injury, turned out to be a blessing in disguise, as it meant that Zárate could make his debut.\n\nZárate, operating in a free role behind Carlton Cole, was a terror in the first half and suggested that his verve could transform West Ham’s attack. Whether he proves as mischievous as this in more challenging circumstances remains to be seen – Palace afforded him far too much space – but this was an encouraging start, even though the Argentinian was lucky not to be sent off for an ugly challenge on Stuart O’Keefe when the game was goalless.\n\nThere is an air of mischief to Zárate, who was at the heart of West Ham’s best moves, and with Cheikhou Kouyaté ruling midfield and Stewart Downing always a threat on the right, Palace had their hands full.\n\nYet for a while Allardyce must have been worrying that he would be rueing his side’s profligacy again, Aaron Cresswell, Kouyaté and Zárate all wasting presentable opportunities. Palace were getting away with it.\n\nBut then came a moment of class from Zárate after 34 minutes. Mark Noble’s shot from the edge of the area was blocked but the ball looped up to Zárate, who showed outstanding technique to swerve a volley past Julián Speroni and into the left corner from 25 yards.\n\nThe goal knocked the stuffing out of Palace and Downing doubled West Ham’s lead three minutes later, cutting in from the right and smoothly curling a shot into the far corner from 20 yards. It was the winger’s first goal from open play for West Ham.\n\nParish looked chastened and James Tomkins should have made it 3-0 shortly after the interval. Yet he headed against the bar and Palace scored with their next attack when Marouane Chamakh drilled a fine low shot past Adrián from 25 yards.\n\nHowever, West Ham did not take long to restore their two-goal lead. Tomkins launched a free-kick into the Palace area, Vaz Tê made a nuisance of himself and Cole applied the finishing touch.

Albion’s fruitless, ongoing quest to some day win a Premier League match away from home in August will have to wait another year at least.\n\nThey had their chances to take all three points in a scoreless stalemate on the south coast and in a repeat of the season’s opening weekend, the Baggies manager, Alan Irvine, and his Saints counterpart, Ronald Koeman, probably both felt their teams could have done better.\n\nBoth sides had chances in a reasonably entertaining, if occasionally pedestrian contest. With both managers having named unchanged sides, Southampton’s best opening came from a rare long ball which prompted a mix-up between Andre Wisdom and his goalkeeper Ben Foster. The confused pair allowed the constantly lively Dusan Tadic, who looks a real find, to nip in behind them, only to stand his cross inches too high for Graziano Pellè.\n\nBarely two minutes of the game had elapsed when West Brom appealed for a penalty: Chris Brunt appeared to have been dragged to ground as he turned Saints skipper José Fonte. In a good position, referee Roger East remained unconvinced and waved play on. “I didn’t think it was a penalty,” Irvine said. “I haven’t watched it back again, but I wasn’t claiming for anything.” Although neither goalkeeper was tested particularly severely throughout, Fraser Forster looked assured under the high ball for Southampton, plucking several Brunt crosses from the sky with ease.\n\nIt was from attacks down the flanks that many of the best first-half chances originated, with Nathaniel Clyne and Tadic looking particularly dangerous on the left for Southampton; Brunt and Sébastien Pocognoli were an ongoing threat for the visitors. After 22 minutes, the West Brom captain’s inswinger floated fractionally too high for the unmarked Victor Anichebe. Seconds later, Pellè failed in almost identical circumstances, leaping in vain to try to convert a similarly lofted delivery from Steven Davis.\n\nThe beginning of the second half heralded the arrival of West Brom’s £10m record signing, Brown Ideye, for his Premier League debut. For Southampton, Shane Long was also given the second half to make up for his frustrating debut. The Irishman lined up on the right of Southampton’s midfield, but it was out and out centre forward Ideye who impressed: heading into the side-netting from a tight angle, then almost winning the game with a sublime piece of skill that left Fonte floundering and forced the save of the game out of Forster.\n\n“It was a difficult, one,” said Koeman, who seemed dissatisfied with his team’s lack of tempo. “Both teams played with very good organisation. Maybe it was a typical 0-0 draw and that’s thanks to Fraser Forster. The big chance they created, he saved fantastic.”\n\nOn more than one occasion for Southampton, Tadic shot when a cross to an unmarked team-mate was the better option. After 68 minutes, an improved long-range effort from the Serb fizzed narrowly wide. While referees’ vanishing spray remains a big hit among Premier League crowds, James Ward-Prowse did his best to steal the foamy fan-favourite’s thunder with a splendid free-kick on 70 minutes, curling the ball around West Brom’s defensive wall and narrowly wide of the left post.

No surprises in this result then.\n\nThe Swans, who defeated Manchester United at Old Trafford on the opening day, remain one of the most attractive teams in the Premier League – a situation unlikely to change with the arrival of Argentina’s Federico Fernández and Jefferson Montero of Ecuador.\n\nThe Clarets scrapped their way out of the Championship as runners-up, and have lost two out of two. Points and pretty football will be at a premium at Turf Moor but that is hardly the fault of Sean Dyche, who is managing them on the proverbial shoestring.\n\nWith that in mind, Dyche had more reason than Garry Monk to be encouraged after Nathan Dyer had celebrated his 100th appearance at this level with the decisive goal. Burnley are still reliant on Championship players because they can afford to pay only Championship transfer fees and wages, and their spirited revival in the second half did them great credit.\n\nDyche said: “We can’t pay £12m for players, as Swansea have done, and we showed them too much respect up until half-time. I told the players during the interval that I wanted them to play with more freedom and energy and a bit of quality, and I thought they were terrific.”\n\nIt was fair comment, Burnley twice threatening to gain a point in the closing stages.\n\nMonk said: “They made it hard for us in the second half, when they threw everything at us. In the first half we were in control, but we weren’t clinical enough. After that I thought we defended very well, limiting them to one shot on target in the 90 minutes. Six points is the best start we could have had after two games, but I know you are only ever two games away from having people on your back.”\n\nThe Swans were comfortably in control for a long time and should have been ahead in the third minute, when Dyer’s cross from the right picked out Wilfried Bony on the edge of the six-yard box. The prolific Ivorian got up well for the header, only to nod it against Tom Heaton’s left-hand post. It was a bad miss by the striker who scored 25 goals for the club in all competitions last season.\n\nThe goal came midway through the first half. Gylfi Sigurdsson’s prompting pass sent Dyer sprinting away on the right from where he cut into the penalty area, losing Michael Duff and scoring from 16 yards. The winger’s shot was well struck, but should have been kept out by Heaton, who let the shot through him at his left-hand upright.\n\nLifted by Dyche’s half-time exhortations, Burnley rallied and after 63 minutes Dean Marney’s cross supplied Lukas Jutkiewicz, whose twisting header was only inches over the crossbar. Four minutes later they were close again, Danny Ings setting up David Jones for a shot, left to right, that Lukasz Fabianski could only parry. Jutkiewicz, following in at the far post, failed narrowly to divert the ball home at close range.\n\nIt does not get any easier for the Premier League newcomers, who are at home to Manchester United on Saturday. By that time Dyche hopes to have signed one or two reinforcements, but do not expect any big names – not unless Leicester’s Gary Taylor-Fletcher fancies a move back to Lancashire."}, {"date":

screen before the kick-off, filmed undergoing an ice bucket challenge at the Everton training ground. For most of the game it appeared his players were carrying out a nomination to douse Arsène Wenger in cold water, yet for a second week in succession Everton let a lead slip and had to be content with a draw that must have left Martínez feeling numb all over again.\n\nMerseyside has not been a happy hunting ground for Wenger of late. The Arsenal manager was on the wrong end of an 8-1 aggregate scoreline after the visits to Anfield and Goodison last season. Though Arsenal secured Champions League qualification ahead of Everton and even picked up a couple of trophies on a winning streak since their 3-0 defeat here last April this was a return to their old failing of being beaten up on northern grounds, until late goals by Aaron Ramsey and Olivier Giroud rescued a point in the most unpromising circumstances.\n\nAs Arsenal can point to tiredness after a trip to Turkey and an Everton goal that could have been disallowed for offside, this result must have felt like a victory after trailing for so long. The old script had a surprise new ending. Alexis Sánchez as a lone striker is an experiment that may not be repeated, but otherwise Arsenal fans went home happy. Their side had shown character and perseverance when the game appeared to have gone, and Wenger was quick to praise the resilience of his players. “At 2-0 you know it can go both ways,” he said. “At two goals down we gave a great response, we showed a complete desire to come back.”\n\nIt is not every week you hear an Arsenal manager saying that, or sending on a striker in Giroud to offer more of a physical threat than the ineffective Sánchez, but what Wenger did worked. Martínez suggested Everton had played an almost perfect game for 75 minutes, though in truth they were on the back foot for most of the second half, grateful for Giroud passing up several earlier chances before finding the net in the final minute. “Two goals should have been enough, but our energy levels dropped in the second half,” the Everton manager said. “We couldn’t keep the effort up for the whole game.”\n\nBoth sides tinkered with their expected formations. Everton moved Romelu Lukaku out to the right for his first home game as a permanent signing, Wenger left Giroud on the bench and deployed Sánchez as a notional front man.\n\nArsenal came up with the first attempt on goal worthy of the name when Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain was only narrowly wide with a snap shot after a reckless clearance by Seamus Coleman had presented him with an unexpected shooting chance, albeit from distance. The Everton full-back made amends almost immediately, heading Everton into an early lead from Gareth Barry’s diagonal cross after Leighton Baines had found the midfielder in space. The cross was probably intended for Lukaku, who could not quite reach it, but Everton had a spare man in the unmarked Coleman. Suddenly the home side were all over their opponents, and Kevin Mirallas could easily have made it two on their next attack, ghosting behind the Arsenal defence to latch on to Steven Naismith’s astute ball forward but poking his shot the wrong side of a post with only Wojciech Szczesny to beat.\n\nArsenal responded in the only way they know, with Ramsey, Mesut Özil, Jack Wilshere and Oxlade-Chamberlain all involved in intricate passing patterns on the edge of the area, though there was no end product to bother Tim Howard apart from another long shot from Oxlade-Chamberlain that drifted wide. With James McCarthy in particular getting back to help his defence and clear up threatening situations Everton were taller and stronger in most challenges. Not for the first time, Arsenal appeared to shrink from the physical confrontation, although it is fair to point out that they had a demanding game in Europe in midweek while Everton were able to rest.\n\nWith Lukaku not making much impact on the right, Mirallas aon the left was Everton’s most effective outlet in the first half, producing some penetrating runs and a cross that fell just behind his fellow Belgian on the stroke of the interval.\n\nMirallas also went close with a shot from a free-kick that rippled Wojciech Szczesny’s side netting before Everton’s £28m acquisition from Chelsea showed his worth, highlighting some pretty unimpressive Arsenal defending in the process, in the closing seconds of the half. First, Lukaku had the strength to keep his feet in accepting a pass in his own half, resisting a challenge from Per Mertesacker in which the Arsenal captain sold himself far too easily. Leaving the big German on his backside, Lukaku knocked the ball into empty space as Calum Chambers vainly attempted to intercept on half way, and with only Mathieu Flamini left to cover the Arsenal penalty area it was a simple matter for Everton’s record signing to play in Naismith to beat Szczesny with a smart shot on the turn.\n\nArsenal protested with some justification that Naismith might have been fractionally offside when Lukaku released the ball, but it was a technicality missed by most people in the ground, including the officials. It would almost have been a travesty had the goal been chalked off, an undeserved reprieve for a defence who had demonstrably been torn to shreds.\n\nOn for the second half, however, Giroud almost scored with his first touch with a volley from Oxlade-Chamberlain’s cross. Unlike Sánchez the French striker is at least accustomed to playing up front on his own, and he was involved in Arsenal’s next two chances, first pulling a shot wide from the edge of the area then forcing a save from Howard after the ball briefly broke to him in front of goal.\n\nWith Lukaku giving Mertesacker a torrid time, Everton had opportunities to increase their lead, though the Belgian himself was often guilty of wasteful indecision. After spending an eternity on the edge of their own area as the game moved into its final 10 minutes, the home side had only themselves to blame when Ramsey pulled a goal back from Santi Cazorla’s probing cross. It gave Arsenal fresh heart, and with Lukaku off the field and Everton no longer able to break out of their own half at will, there was an inevitability about Giroud’s last-minute equaliser after Nacho Monreal had centred from the left.\n\nEverton had dominated the game, yet Giroud could easily have had a second-half hat-trick. Everton would really have been left kicking themselves had he found the target with his simplest chance, a free header from a corner five minutes from time. Had Giroud been on the field for the whole game, or even if he had found his range a little earlier than the 90th minute, Arsenal might have had all three points. They certainly had the chances, and though they took a battering in the first half, by the end it was Everton who looked the more fragile.

Burnley had taken the lead and, briefly, their supporters must have dared wonder whether they would be talking about Scott Arfield’s goal in years to come with the fondness they reserve for Robbie Blake’s finest moment for the club. Then Chelsea snapped them out of their dreams, ruthlessly and brilliantly. It was pass-them-to-death football during that blitz of retaliatory strikes and, by the time they were done, José Mourinho’s team had left the team that came up from the Championship looking in need of smelling salts.\n\nAnother side might have been badly affected by that early setback, in a strange environment, with an excitable home crowd. Mourinho’s players simply rolled up their sleeves and set about turning the game upside down. Diego Costa, on his first Premier League start, quickly settled them down with the equaliser. They took the lead four minutes later when André Schürrle finished off a wonderful exchange of passes and they were rampant by the time Branislav Ivanovic added the third. Cesc Fábregas was superb on his re-introduction to English football and there was a vibrancy to Chelsea’s attacking that was not always evident last season.\n\nSean Dyche, the Burnley manager, talked later about a side “with a touch of arrogance”. He meant it as a compliment and Mourinho’s team could be excused for slacking off in the second half when the game was effectively over as a contest. Chelsea still left the clear impression that the arrival of Costa and, in particular, Fábregas had already improved them.\n\nDyche can take a flicker of encouragement from the way the team he described as “the biggest underdogs in the history of the league” bared their teeth early on. Unfortunately for them, they also quickly discovered Chelsea are not a side to wilt the moment something goes wrong. “Emotionally we were not affected,” Mourinho said. “We never lost our composure.”\n\nTheir response was a reminder to Burnley about the gulf between the sides they now have to face compared with last season. It was a blur of speed and movement and a lesson, too, about what can happen when a team built for £5m bumps into one with a valuation of £190m. Burnley are simply not accustomed to playing sides that move the ball this devastatingly.\n\nChelsea’s equaliser came within four minutes when Ivanovic broke forward on the right. His low centre took a slight flick off Michael Duff and then went across the goalmouth before coming back off the post. From six yards Costa had his first chance of the evening. He was on the ball in a flash, scoring emphatically with his left foot.\n\nIf that carried a touch of good fortune, the next goal left Chelsea’s opponents dizzy. Eden Hazard’s mazy run through the middle started the move. Ivanovic turned the ball into Fábregas and the former Arsenal and Barcelona player clipped a beautifully weighted pass into Schürrle’s path. Schürrle had anticipated what was coming and did not break stride as he stroked the ball past Tom Heaton.\n\nBurnley’s ordeal might have been worse but for the referee, Michael Oliver, deciding Costa had dived when he intercepted Ben Mee’s back-pass in front of Burnley’s goalkeeper. Costa looked appalled, as strikers always do in those moments, but it was only a passing irritation and within three minutes Fábregas had swung over a corner from the left for Ivanovic to volley in Chelsea’s third goal.\n\nFor Burnley the first lesson must be that they cannot continue defending this obligingly. The tone was set in the fourth minute when the right-back Kieran Tripper underhit a pass to Heaton and the mistake almost led to Schürrle scoring. Mee was culpable for losing Ivanovic for his goal and Dyche, who talked afterwards about urgently needing to strengthen his squad, must have been startled by the frequency of their lapses.\n\nThere are walls at Turf Moor lined with the match reports – “Fergie Tamed” – from that night, the last time they began a Premier League season, when Blake lashed the winning goal into the roof of Manchester United’s net. “Our Turf,” was the message in the claret and blue mosaic in the Jimmy McIlroy Stand and Arfield’s 14th-minute strike fleetingly raised the possibility of another shock. A free transfer from Huddersfield Town last year, Arfield had taken the goal brilliantly, firing through a crowded penalty area to beat the static Thibaut Courtois. After that, however, Burnley did not really test Courtois, on the night he took over from Petr Cech as Chelsea’s first-choice goalkeeper, until early in the second half when he palmed away another Arfield effort.\n\nDidier Drogba, back at the club where he fits best, came on as a second-half substitute and showed a glimpse of his old gifts, taking down Courtois’s long kick on his knee and volleying a shot just wide with his next touch. Majestic in the first half, comfortable in the second, Chelsea look like a team who mean business."}, {"date": "17/08/2014", "arena": "Anfield", "attendance": 44736, "home_team": {"name": "Liverpool", "lineup": [{"name": "Simon Mignolet", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Javi Manquillo", "yellows": [34], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Skrtel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dejan Lovren", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Glen Johnson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Gerrard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lucas Leiva", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [63]}, {"name": "Jordan Henderson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Philippe Coutinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [76]}, {"name": "Raheem Sterling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [23], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daniel Sturridge", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [79], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Brad Jones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kolo Touré", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rickie Lambert", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [76], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mamadou Sakho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Emre Can", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Allen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [63], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordon Ibe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Southampton", "lineup": [{"name": "Fraser Forster", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathaniel Clyne", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [56], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "José Fonte", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Maya Yoshida", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Bertrand", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Davis", "yellows": [78], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [82]}, {"name": "Morgan Schneiderlin", "yellows": [65], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Wanyama", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Ward-Prowse", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Graziano Pellè", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dusan Tadic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [74]}], "subs": [{"name": "Kelvin Davis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shane Long", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [74], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Atila Turan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Cork", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jos Hooiveld", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lloyd Isgrove", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [82], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Stephens", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "The winning goal brought Brendan Rodgers bounding on to the pitch for the first time since Liverpool’s victory over Manchester City during last season’s title run-in. Relief, not delirium, sparked the Liverpool manager’s invasion on this occasion but the over-exuberance was understandable. Here was a reminder of how that title challenge began.\n\nFor Southampton at Anfield in August 2014 read Stoke City at Anfield in August 2013. Twelve months ago Liverpool laboured to three points against a team under new management courtesy of a Daniel Sturridge goal and an 89th-minute penalty save from Simon Mignolet. The script remained the same for Ronald Koeman’s first day as a Premier League manager.\n\nA poacher’s goal from Sturridge plus a superb 88th-minute save from Mignolet, who tipped Morgan Schneiderlin’s goal-bound volley on to the bar to preserve a slender lead, left Southampton lamenting an undeserved defeat.\n\nRodgers barely mentioned Liverpool’s performance level after the match. The first day back at school was the time to accentuate the positives and the manager will not begrudge a repeat of Stoke providing Liverpool’s entire campaign mirrors last season. Among the unspoken concerns must be how Schneiderlin, Victor Wanyama and Steven Davis dominated Liverpool’s central midfield and restricted the home side’s threat. But Koeman summed up the contest perfectly when he said: “We created two great possibilities to score a second goal but the quality of Liverpool is that they don’t need a lot of opportunities to score two goals.”\n\nOn the first day of life without Luis Suárez, who sent Rodgers a good luck text before kick-off, it reassured Liverpool to witness another predatory finish from Sturridge. The England international was largely anonymous against Koeman’s team and, of the 22 players who started, only the Southampton goalkeeper Fraser Forster touched the ball less. But he got the one that counted. Sturridge has scored 36 goals in 50 appearances for his club, the most prolific return of any Liverpool player since George Allan in the late 19th century, and his 79th-minute winner signalled mass relief around Anfield.\n\nThis was far from a fluid, threatening performance by Liverpool and responsibility for their pedestrian start lay with Southampton. The mass, lucrative exodus from St Mary’s Stadium may have caused trepidation in those supporters who made the Sunday morning journey from the south coast but the early signs under Koeman brought encouragement.\n\nDisciplined and positive, they worked tirelessly to limit space for Liverpool’s front three and had a consistent outlet in the impressive James Ward-Prowse and the new signing Dusan Tadic. Yet, as most teams discovered at Anfield last season, Rodgers’ players are always alert to the slightest opportunity. Southampton were looking increasingly comfortable when they fell behind after a moment of excellence from Jordan Henderson.\n\nSchneiderlin has made no secret of his desire to follow Adam Lallana, Luke Shaw, Rickie Lambert, Calum Chambers and Dejan Lovren out of St Mary’s. Koeman started the France international at Anfield regardless and was repaid with an impressive display, although a half-hearted challenge on Henderson inside the Liverpool half proved costly. The England midfielder powered through a 50-50 with Schneiderlin and sent Raheem Sterling scurrying clear of Nathaniel Clyne with an exquisite left-footed pass. Sterling duly applied a measured finish into Forster’s bottom left-hand corner.\n\nThe breakthrough injected overdue urgency into Liverpool’s display. Sterling, Sturridge and Philippe Coutinho began to move with greater menace but Southampton’s shape and composure held firm. Liverpool’s attempt to assume control quickly petered out.\n\nWard-Prowse almost levelled with a dangerous free-kick to the far corner that drew a fine save from Mignolet. The Liverpool goalkeeper also tipped over from Schneiderlin and, though Sterling tested Forster again on the stroke of half-time, the visitors’ equaliser early in the second half was thoroughly deserved and superbly executed too. Clyne broke down the right and squared inside to Tadic. The Serbian, the first signing of Koeman’s reign from FC Twente, back-heeled the ball into Clyne’s path and the full-back lashed an unstoppable shot into the top corner.\n\nSteven Davis squandered a glorious chance to give Southampton the lead shortly afterwards when he shot tamely at Mignolet having been picked out unmarked in front of goal by Ward-Prowse. Glen Johnson produced a perfectly timed challenge to thwart Ward-Prowse in the area as Koeman’s team looked to capitalise on a pedestrian Liverpool but, as in the first half, Rodgers’ team struck when Southampton were in the ascendancy.\n\nJavier Manquillo’s right-wing cross was headed clear by Wanyama but his team-mates switched off at the vital moment. Sterling won the second ball with an unchallenged header inside the area and Sturridge applied the faintest of touches to convert beyond Forster. There was still time for Southampton to recover and Schneiderlin looked to have secured a merited point when he crashed a volley towards the Kop goal from 12 yards out.\n\nMignolet, however, produced a stunning stop to divert the ball on to the bar and the substitute Shane Long headed the rebound wide. Reprieved and relieved, Liverpool are off the mark.\n\nMan of the match James Ward-Prowse (Southampton)"}, {"date": "17/08/2014", "arena": "St James' Park, Newcastle", "attendance": 50816,

continued from where they left off last season, while also leaving the clear impression there is better to come. Manuel Pellegrini’s team are still trying to restore some order from the summer, with players returning at different times, Sergio Agüero short of fitness and Gaël Clichy temporarily standing in as a makeshift right-back. And yet they still managed to win without a single shot to trouble Joe Hart in goal.\n\nIt was their 11th straight victory against Newcastle and a reminder of their collective strength even on a day when there were only fleeting glimpses of the attacking qualities that made them such prolific scorers last season. Not everything has clicked straight away but there was still plenty to admire about their structure and knowhow, withstanding some concerted pressure from the home side and then picking them off with their extra quality.\n\nAgüero had been on the pitch only eight minutes when he sealed the win in stoppage-time and there was a touch of brilliance about the moment they took the lead, via David Silva, six minutes before the interval. This might not have been the slickest City display – “solid” was the word Pellegrini kept using – but what a stunning reminder that goal was about the gulf that exists between the sides competing for the top prizes and the ones huffing and puffing below.\n\nEdin Dzeko has had a distinguished career but it is debatable whether he has ever produced a moment as exquisite as the back-heel with which he took out two defenders and left Silva with his chance to gather the ball inside the penalty area and score with a low diagonal shot past Tim Krul in Newcastle’s goal.\n\nDzeko, the creator, and Silva, the clinical finisher, appeared to have swapped their usual roles. It was a stunning piece of team play and penetrative attacking whereas the problem all afternoon for Newcastle was that they just did not have the ingenuity to get behind City’s defence and create clear chances. The home side can at least take encouragement from the way they subdued their opponents for long parts of the game and, for now, the crowd appear willing to show a measure of restraint when it comes to their relationship with Pardew and his observation in his programme notes that this is a “new Newcastle”.\n\nWhen the two sides met in Manchester on the opening day of last season it was a 4-0 thrashing for the north-east club. Yohan Cabaye had just gone on strike and Pardew’s popularity waned to the point that Newcastle finished the season with the crowd in open mutiny.\n\nThis latest defeat was nothing like as galling and he was entitled afterwards to praise their efforts. Rémy Cabella was the brightest player on the pitch in the first half and another of their summer signings, Jack Colback, quickly won over his new set of supporters, with his crisp challenges and competence on the ball.\n\nNewcastle did, however, look short of ideas in attack in the moments when Cabella drifted out of the game and their new striker, Emmanuel Rivière, had a difficult introduction. Signed from Monaco, he looked anxious at times and maybe too eager to please. When he had his first sight of goal in the opening half he tried an implausible shot from 40 yards and there were not too many other occasions when he troubled Vincent Kompany and Martin Demichelis in the heart of the opposition defence.\n\nHe was substituted with six minutes to go for another debutant, Ayoze Pérez, and the 21-year-old Spaniard almost made an immediate impact, running into the penalty area before taking aim. Fernando, the new minder in City’s midfield, had dashed back to make a telling interception, diverting the ball behind Hart’s goal.\n\nNewcastle will reflect on other moments during the second half when they worked up a head of steam and created at least three reasonable chances to equalise. Paul Dummett headed one over the crossbar from a corner and Yoan Gouffran did not show enough conviction when the ball fell his way during one of several goalmouth scrambles. “We didn’t get a break”, Pardew lamented. “That’s what you need against the top teams. But we didn’t get a break, we didn’t get a ricochet.”\n\nEqually they did not have the same refinement as their opponents when it really mattered. Dzeko showed why City have been keen to add him to the list of players who have recently signed new contracts, with Pellegrini confirming that the announcement should be soon. Stevan Jovetic also looks as if he could have a profitable season if he can steer clear of the injuries that have held back his City career so far. Yaya Touré did not have one of his better games, ambling through parts of the game, but Fernando showed why he has been brought in as an upgrade on Javi García – covering space, closing down opponents and acting as a useful barrier in front of defence.\n\nNewcastle put together 12 shots in total but their finishing was poor, epitomised by the chance Moussa Sissoko put over the crossbar just before Agüero scampered away to score the second goal.\n\nHe might be lacking fitness but he still managed to elude Fabricio Coloccini from the substitute Fernandinho’s pass. His first effort was left-footed from a difficult angle and came back to him off Krul. Agüero was on his feet in a flash and the Argentinian’s follow-up shot was with the other foot, expertly picking out the far corner.\n\nMan of the match Vincent Kompany (Manchester City)"}, {"date":

New manager, same old story, even if the home crowd would like to trust there is better to come.\n\nSwansea were too streetwise, defending in a pack then breaking on the counterattack and exploiting the mistakes in United’s defence to win through Gylfi Sigurdsson’s 73rd-minute goal, the midfielder making an immediate impact in his second stint with the Welsh team. Sigurdsson, signed back from Tottenham Hotspur in the summer, was also involved when Ki Sung-yueng gave Swansea a first-half lead and it would be unfair on Garry Monk’s team if their performance was largely overlooked amid the scrutiny on their opponents. They never lost their nerve even after Wayne Rooney’s equaliser early in the second half, when United finally looked like they might rediscover some of the old panache.\n\nIt turned out to be a deception and Van Gaal, with the disappointment etched on his face, will certainly have learned more about what needs to be put right. Unfortunately for him, it is a considerable list bearing in mind the shortage of pace, the erratic passing of Chris Smalling and Phil Jones and the general lack of flair, as if somewhere along the line this proud club have lost sight of what should be expected in those red shirts. The new manager talked afterwards about seeing players who had allowed nerves to undermine their performances. He sounded startled that they had been afflicted that way.\n\nThe sight of Tyler Blackett in the back line and Jesse Lingard starting the match as the right wing-back should also conjure up mixed feelings. Van Gaal likes to remind his audience he was the manager who brought through a 16-year-old Clarence Seedorf and gave a debut to the teenage David Alaba and Thomas Müller, among others, but in United’s case these players were being fast-tracked into the team because of the fragile nature of their squad, exacerbated by a punishing injury list and a lack of signings.\n\nGylfi Sigurdsson celebrates the winner. Photograph: Peter Powell/EPA\n\nBlackett did, however, acquit himself well and Lingard was unfortunate to be injured after a bright start.\n\nVan Gaal has been working with a 3-4-1-2 system ever since he took the job but here, too, was the proof that too much can be read into positive pre-season results. At half-time, the new manager had seen enough and abandoned everything they had been practising. Ashley Young was moved to left-back in a more orthodox 4-2-3-1 formation, albeit lacking natural full-backs, and briefly there was at least an improvement. Rooney hooked in Jones’s flick-on from a Juan Mata corner and at that stage it was easy to imagine the classic fightback, petals being thrown at Van Gaal’s feet and the sense of a wonderful new beginning.\n\nBack in the real world, Old Trafford is no longer a place where opponents expect to be beaten. “I can guarantee nobody gave us a hope,” Monk said afterwards, praising his team for their togetherness. Swansea played with belief and composure, with Ashley Williams excelling in defence and Sigurdsson dovetailing nicely with Ki and Jonjo Shelvey.\n\nSmalling was caught out by a quickly taken free-kick and Jefferson Montero, one of the visiting substitutes, broke down the left before turning his cross into the penalty area. Wayne Routledge’s shot was mistimed, coming in from the right, but the ball fell kindly for Sigurdsson to side-foot a follow-up effort that struck the goalkeeper, David de Gea, but crept over the line.\n\nUnited had plenty of the ball as they desperately tried to concoct one of their late moments of drama but their problem all afternoon was that they rarely did enough with it. Too often, the ball was passed around at the back, or sideways through an unimaginative midfield. It was when they had to be more adventurous that they came up badly short. Robin van Persie was badly missed and Javier Hernández was poor enough to be substituted at the interval.\n\nSwansea had the greater pace and penetration and opened the scoring in the 28th minute. Until that stage, they had barely threatened but Ander Herrera did not track Ki’s run closely enough and Wilfried Bony, an oak tree of a striker, did a superb job of getting in the way of Jones, so that his team-mate could pick his spot without anyone closing him down. Nathan Dyer and Sigurdsson had worked the ball to Ki from the right and his left-foot shot found the bottom corner from just outside the penalty area."}, {"date": "16/08/2014", "arena": "The King

Roberto Martínez.\n\nWith the Everton manager hoping to go one better than last year and break into the promised land of the Premier League’s top four, the news that Ross Barkley’s knee injury could keep the England midfielder out of action for several months was about as welcome as Chris Wood’s equaliser four minutes from time which earned Leicester a point on their return to the top flight after a decade’s absence.\n\nBarkley will have further scans on the medial knee ligament injury he picked up in training and despite a brilliant finish from his replacement in the No10 role, Steven Naismith, Martínez will be praying the prognosis on his young star is not as bad as feared.\n\n“The problem is with his medial ligament in his knee and we don’t know how bad it is,” the Spaniard said. “It could be between seven weeks or four or five months. But however long he is out for, we need to make sure we react as a team. Of course, we’re going to miss him a lot. He was looking so sharp in pre-season and we were so unlucky to lose him to an innocuous challenge in training. Now he’s going to be out for a long, long time.”\n\nAll the talk before this match was about the full debuts of two new strikers costing a total of £36m, although it was Leonardo Ulloa, Leicester’s £8m signing from Brighton, who found his way on to the scoresheet when he equalised within two minutes of Aiden McGeady’s spectacular opener, before Naismith restored the lead just before half-time.\n\nMartínez was full of praise for £28m Romelu Lukaku as the Belgian striker made his full debut having spent last season on loan from Chelsea, although the 21-year-old looks well short of match practice after featuring in his country’s run to the quarter-finals in Brazil.\n\nDespite the arrival of the Argentinian Ulloa also for a club record fee, it was Leicester’s Thai owner, Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, whose face adorned the matchday programme on their return to the top flight. He has stated in the past his target to see Leicester compete with the top clubs in the country within five years, although for now it seems he will be content with mere survival given the length of time it has taken them to escape the Championship.\n\nOn paper, Nigel Pearson’s side looks like it lacks the required experience to survive at this level yet a spirited comeback in the second half that culminated in Wood’s smartly taken finish showed that they will have half a chance. “It’s nice to get something out of the game having gone behind twice,” Pearson said. “There was an element of misfortune from our point of view about both but it would have been easy to think things weren’t going our way so I’m really pleased with the way we responded. We’ll need to improve in certain areas but the biggest message from today is that even when we have injuries we are capable of getting a result against quality sides.”\n\nFor Martínez, it was definitely a case of two points dropped. Even with a strong bench featuring new signings Muhamed Besic and Christian Atsu which should help ease the loss of Barkley, the manager accepted that he could have done more to secure the three points.\n\n“We should have won but it is only us to blame,” he said. “We controlled the environment of playing a newly promoted side well and went ahead but we should have gone for the third goal rather than just trying to hold on. We didn’t show the concentration levels that are needed. It’s disappointing to concede a goal so late.”\n\nWood could easily have found himself back in the Championship without having kicked a ball in anger but Wolves had a bid for him rejected. However, Pearson insisted he is going nowhere and, on the evidence of his cool finish past Tim Howard, you can see why. “He’s staying. I’ve spoken to Chris on a couple of occasions this week and he is happy to stay,” said the manager.\n\n“It can be unsettling for any individual to be involved in speculation about his future but I’m very pleased he was able to play his part in securing our first Premier League point of the season.”"}, {"date": "16/08/2014", "arena": "Kiyan Prince Foundation Stadium", "attendance": 17603,

elude the former England captain here to head a precious winning goal and ruin QPR’s return to the Premier League. That crowned a gleaming display by the 25-year-old, but Ferdinand had been impeccable until that point and Rangers had been on top.\n\nChester’s 52nd-minute strike will stand as a painful reminder to Harry Redknapp’s promoted side that in the Premier League teams can pay a hefty price for squandering chances. Charlie Austin missed their most obvious opportunity, his 83rd-minute penalty being saved by Allan McGregor, but the hosts spurned several openings before that, especially in a first half in which they started timidly before working up an impressive head of steam and threatening to blow away the visitors.\n\n“I was very pleased with how we played, some days it just does not go your way,” said Redknapp. “We played ever so well in the first half. We had good control, a good shape and we passed it well and created good chances.”\n\nThat is true. Rangers looked solid in a 3-5-2 formation with Ferdinand and another new signing, Steven Caulker, combining with Richard Dunne to prevent Hull from mustering a single shot on target in the first period.\n\nThe visitors did seem more fluent in the early stages but once Loïc Rémy forced a save from McGregor in the 13th minute, Rangers grew in confidence and took charge.\n\nAlejandro Faurlin fizzed a low shot wide after swivelling near the penalty spot. Joey Barton curled a free-kick into the side netting and Jordon Mutch nodded wide from close range after a fine run and cross by Rémy.\n\nHull’s worries deepened when one of their new acquisitions, Robert Snodgrass, departed with suspected knee ligament damage just before half-time. Another summer recruit, the 20-year-old Andrew Robertson, saved them in the 43rd minute by heading a Caulker header off the line after a Rangers corner.\n\nThe one upside to Snodgrass’s loss was that his replacement, Stephen Quinn, helped turn the game back in the visitors’ favour. Seven minutes into the second half he delivered a corner and Ferdinand was caught unaware as Chester held him off and headed into the net.\n\nRedknapp said that did not diminish his satisfaction with the 35-year-old’s contribution. “He was excellent, it was almost a masterclass in how to play at the back,” he said. “He looks so comfortable, his touch, his reading of the game. [For the goal] there was plenty of bodies in there, they’re getting blocks in and all sorts and the fellow just spun off him. It was good movement, it can happen.”\n\nHull could have added a second when Quinn played a canny reverse pass to Thomas Ince but Rob Green blocked well.\n\nThey continued their quest for a second and Chester remained a menace from corners, one of his headers leading to Nikica Jelavic whacking a volley inches over and in the 80th minute Chester made a decisive intervention at the other end, clearing a Barton cross just as Rémy readied himself to convert from close range.\n\nSeven minutes from time Chester was harshly penalised when a cross by Junior Hoilett hit his hand but his sense of grievance did not last long as McGregor beat away Austin’s soft spot-kick.\n\n“That’s one win, we need nine more,” said Steve Bruce, for whom survival remains the main ambition. “So that’s one win per month – it sounds easy but it’s not if that was anything to go by.”\n\nRedknapp, meanwhile, is confident his team can achieve the same goal. “We played better here than we did in the majority of our games in the Championship last year and we’re only going to get better,” he said before confirming that the club intends signing “two or three” more players this week."}, {"date": "16/08/2014",

With Christian Benteke to return in October, Villa’s fortunes in this transitional period could be on the turn.\n\nBojan Krkic, signed from Barcelona, flashed and burned on a difficult debut in English football and Mark Hughes, pleased to have acquired Victor Moses on loan from Chelsea for a year, admitted he will have to pick and choose the games in which he can expect the erstwhile “next Lionel Messi” to shine for Stoke. “This was a bit of a wake-up call for us,” the Stoke manager said, “because we all had high expectations and they’ve been tempered somewhat today. We know we need to work hard this season. But we also need to be better than that.\n\n“It was important [Krkic] got some game time. He showed glimpses in some situations. We need to be able to find him in those [attacking] areas more often. We need to play him in the right games against the right opposition to get the best out of him.”\n\nStoke did the double over Villa last year, have finished above them for the past three seasons and achieved their highest league position since 1975 in finishing ninth in the Premier League last term. But while they started brightly Krkic drifting across the line behind Mame Biram Diouf, his fellow attacking debutant, and cutting in from the left to shoot into the side-netting, Villa grew into the game and deserved their first away victory since New Year’s Day.\n\nWith the club up for sale, Villa’s woes are far from over but with the experience they have acquired this summer, and Carlos Sánchez, the Colombia anchorman, to integrate into their midfield, they look as if they will be much harder to beat this season on this evidence. No ever-present in the Premier League over the past two seasons have conceded more goals than Villa, which is why Lambert has been pleased to recall Alan Hutton, cast out for two years as the club tried and failed to lever him off the wage bill, and bring in Philippe Senderos, Aly Cissokho and Kieran Richardson, who were excellent on their debuts.\n\nWith a solid platform, Villa attacked well and Gabby Agbonlahor should have scored midway through the first half when Richardson capitalised on indecision between Asmir Begovic and Marc Wilson to cross to the former England striker who shot wide when under pressure from Ryan Shawcross.\n\nVilla fans cheered their team off raucously at half-time, scenting what now constitutes a surprise result, and their volume increased another notch five minutes after the restart when Weimann gave them the lead. There was a fine buildup through midfield before the ball was played to Charles N’Zogbia, another of Villa’s long-forgotten returnees, who turned superbly on the edge of the penalty area only for Glenn Whelan to scoop the ball off his toes.\n\nInadvertently, however, the Stoke anchorman passed the ball out to Weimann, wide on the right of the Stoke box. His first touch was poor but he responded in the best fashion by winning the ricochet off Wilson and thrashing his shot across goal and into the far corner of the net.\n\n“This year is a totally different feeling,” Lambert said. “I thought we were outstanding and that we deserved to win the game.”"}, {"date": "16/08/2014", "arena": "The Hawthorns", "attendance": 25468, "home_team": {"name":

Here was an early education in the pressures and pitfalls of Premier League management as his side surrendered three points, with five minutes remaining, after Sebastian Larsson’s equaliser.\n\nThe Scot, making his top-flight bow as a number one, certainly experienced the full merry-go-round of emotions as his side fought back from Lee Cattermole’s stunning opener to lead, courtesy of Saido Berahino’s brace.\n\nAn inability to see out games was the Baggies’ undoing last season and, on this early evidence, little has changed. Irvine, however, remained upbeat – and considering a clutch of players, including £10m record signing Brown Ideye, an unused substitute, and Joleon Lescott were not involved, he has some just cause.\n\nYet, after being met with a lukewarm response by a significant section of supporters unconvinced by his credentials, after indifferent stints lower down the league ladder, a win would have made things so much easier.\n\n“It was special for me to manage for the first time in the Premier League,” Irvine said. “I’m disappointed not to have won, but we did a lot of good things. Last year, we didn’t come back from going behind, so to do that was really pleasing.”\n\nIt was, all in all, a fair result between two sides that were closely matched last season – both narrowly escaping relegation – and that will have to improve to avoid doing so again. The portents had, however, appeared promising for Sunderland after five minutes, when Cattermole crashed home an unlikely goal of the month contender.\n\nThe midfielder tidily trapped Jonas Olsson’s clearance before letting rip with a shot of such velocity that not even Ben Foster’s fingertips could prevent it from finding the top-right corner.\n\nSunderland could – and should – have doubled their advantage when Valentin Roberge nodded Larsson’s arrowed diagonal delivery the wrong side of the post.\n\nIt was a fortunate escape for the home side, whose best efforts continued to come from long range, first via Chris Brunt, then Craig Gardner – making his debut, in one of those eerily common twists of fate, against the club from which he signed.\n\nFinally, the goal came – and the excellent Gardner played his part. Anichebe, inside the penalty area, rolled Roberge in an attempt to latch on to Gardner’s probing pass, and a brush on the shoulder from the centre-back was sufficient to send the Nigeria international tumbling. Even Irvine admitted it was “soft” – Anichebe, after all, boasts the build of a heavyweight boxer. Berahino dispatched the penalty with customary calm, sending Vito Mannone the wrong way.\n\nBlack Cats manager Gus Poyet fumed: “If you ask every single manager we want to talk about football, but we always find ourselves talking about a decision. I’m not going to get myself into trouble.”\n\nCraig Dawson and Steven Fletcher both had efforts correctly ruled out, while Jack Rodwell was substituted on a disappointing debut.\n\nIt appeared to be Irvine’s day when Berahino added his second by sweeping home Gardner’s ball to the back post, after Mannone had failed to parry Graham Dorrans’ shot to safety.\n\nYet Sunderland persisted and, with five minutes remaining, the unmarked Larsson swept home Patrick van Aanholt’s cutback."}, {"date": "16/08/2014", "arena": "Upton Park", "attendance": 34977, "home_team": {"name": "West Ham United",

"report": "Sam Allardyce spoke about the number of opportunities created by West Ham. He pointed to the penalty that Mark Noble missed in the first half, said that the way his team outplayed Tottenham Hotspur gives him great encouragement for what lies ahead and laughed off suggestions that his job could be under threat after this galling defeat. “If they’re going to do it after one game, they might as well have done it at the end of last season,” he said.\n\nThey almost did. Yet Allardyce had a point. If Noble had scored, West Ham probably would have won and the boos would not have rung around Upton Park when Chris Foy blew for full-time moments after Eric Dier had given Mauricio Pochettino a perfect start as Tottenham’s manager.\n\nYet Noble dragged his effort from 12 yards wide and supporters are losing patience with the number of times they hear Allardyce bemoaning West Ham’s wastefulness in front of goal. They played the majority of the match against 10 men after Kyle Naughton’s controversial red card in the first half and they were not good enough to capitalise against a team not always noted for its stubbornness in the face of adversity.\n\nWest Ham paid because, once again, they have started the season without a top-class striker. Andy Carroll is out until November with torn ankle ligaments, Enner Valencia was fit enough only for a place on the bench, Diafra Sakho was left out after arriving from Metz on Thursday night and although Carlton Cole battled hard, he falls well below the standard expected from a striker in the Premier League. Ricardo Vaz Tê, too, will reflect on a number of chances that went begging in the first half. Stewart Downing should have beaten Hugo Lloris from close range near the end.\n\nPochettino, not entirely comfortable speaking in English but giving it a good go nonetheless, was rewarded for the positivity he showed after Naughton was sent off, his decision to move Etienne Capoue from midfield into defence and keep his attacking players on the pitch ensuring that Tottenham retained their threat on the break and ultimately led to the James Collins red card that made it 10 against 10 in the second half.\n\nFor Pochettino it was about belief. Tottenham collapsed in this fixture last season after Younès Kaboul’s red card. This time they stood firm and stunned West Ham when Dier, 20, the defender who was signed from Sporting Lisbon in the summer, burst on to Harry Kane’s pass in stoppage time, rounded Adrián and tapped the ball into the empty net.\n\n“It was an unfair red but the more important thing was that we never gave up and always kept calm,” Pochettino said. “We need to believe, always for 90 or 95 minutes. This is our philosophy.”\n\nThat philosophy was tested at times and Tottenham did not always keep their cool. After a bright start from the visitors – Pochettino demands everything from his players in training and Tottenham looked sharp in the opening 20 minutes – West Ham began to impose themselves.\n\nVaz Tê and Cheikhou Kouyaté flashed headers wide, before Kevin Nolan’s spin and volley was handled by Naughton. Michael McDonough, Foy’s assistant, flagged, a penalty was awarded and Naughton was sent off for denying a goalscoring opportunity. “It was unfair because the ball was going outside the target,” Pochettino said.\n\nIt did not matter, though, because Noble missed a penalty for the first time since 2009. Vaz Tê then spurned two fine chances but West Ham grew sloppy and predictable after the break, too reliant on hopeful crosses as Allardyce resisted calls to introduce another striker.\n\nThe old failings were becoming sorely evident and Tottenham fed off the edginess. Collins was booked for fouling Erik Lamela, then for checking a rampaging Emmanuel Adebayor, and soon Adrián was forced to tip over from the substitute Andros Townsend.\n\nValencia came on for a late cameo and West Ham still might have won it after Nolan released Downing. Yet the winger took too long, Lloris was out quickly to block him and there was still time for Dier to write himself into Tottenham folklore.\n\nKyle Naughton is sent off by Chris Foy.

The Welshman had the last word in the FA Cup final victory that triggered a domino effect of optimism through the summer. Here he salvaged a day that threatened to end in exasperation after Palace had resisted with the instincts instilled by the man conspicuously missing from the away dugout, Tony Pulis.\n\nThis time last year, the atmosphere at the Emirates was toxic as Aston Villa helped themselves to three points on the opening day of the season, and the crowd was mutinous as Arsène Wenger was assailed with furious cries to spend some of that luxuriously priced ticket money.\n\nThis year, money has been spent and spirits were high at kick-off, yet a disjointed performance against Crystal Palace headed towards another situation where the new season curtain didn’t so much swish open as collapse unceremoniously as the game slunk into stoppage time all square. Against a team without a manager. Thanks to Ramsey’s intervention, this is one to file away as three points thanks very much, with the rest best forgotten.\n\nFor Palace, it was a bitter end to a stressful few days. The team could not have given more under the circumstances. “I am proud of the players. When you think about what they have been through the past couple of days, you are never quite sure how we are going to respond to Tony leaving,” mused caretaker Keith Millen. “You could see from their togetherness they were going to work hard for each other and the club.”\n\nTwo days after that bizarre separation, the imprint of their old manager was still all over their performance. This was Tony Pulis’s team, Tony Pulis’s system, Tony Pulis’s spirit of determined organisation, and playing in the style of the ex-boss was sufficient to frustrate Arsenal for a long period.\n\nWenger did not seem overly bothered in the end. “You could see on the first game of the season we are the only team who has won at home,” he pointed out. “So that shows you it is difficult for everyone on the first day of the season. We got the three points we wanted so let’s focus now on Besiktas.” With a Champions League qualifier in Turkey on Tuesday, followed by a difficult assignment at Everton (a fixture they lost painfully last season) on Saturday, this is a busy period of their season where hard results evidently count for more than beauty contests.\n\nArsenal were not at their most cohesive. “Our attitude was right. Our fluency we can do better. That will come,” noted Wenger. “We still lack a bit of pace in the final third to change what we build up into a dangerous situation.”\n\nThat was a fair assessment. Rhythm was hard to come by, partly because they are working on their sharpness, and partly because Palace were drilled well enough to make life difficult. They were well manned at the back, with Brede Hangeland slotting in and Joe Ledley and Mile Jedinak sitting tight in front of the back four.\n\nArsenal’s meandering passing was rudely interrupted when Palace took the lead. They showed a sudden sense of adventure when Wojciech Szczesny sprinted out of his area to deal with a long ball but he could only hoik his clearance as far as Marouane Chamakh, level with the front edge of the centre circle. The forward who never cut it at Arsenal took aim, and Laurent Koscielny improvised superbly to hook away the danger and then make another saving tackle to deny Fraizer Campbell.\n\nFrom the resulting corner, though, nobody was able to match the giant frame of Hangeland – certainly not Alexis Sánchez, who was the man detailed with trying to mark him. Not the obvious choice, it must be said. Hangeland’s height advantage was a full 30cm. After going three entire seasons without a league goal, he managed one in less than half of his Palace debut, running in to rise above Koscielny to nod into the bottom corner.\n\nShortly before half time, Arsenal responded when Sánchez stood over a dead ball and chipped the ball forward to drop enticingly for Koscielny to glance in the equaliser.\n\nPalace were reduced to 10 men at the end of a sluggish second period when Jason Puncheon was sent off for a second booking. Whether that man down made the difference was moot, but Palace suddenly looked unstable as the ball pinged around their box in stoppage time. Koscielny and Olivier Giroud won important headers, Mathieu Debuchy lashed in from close range, and Julián Speroni’s point-blank save fell invitingly for Ramsey.\n\nInstinctively he bundled the ball in to take all Arsenal’s frustration and load it on to Palace."}]
