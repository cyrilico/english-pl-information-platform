Needing slip-ups from either Liverpool or Manchester City on the final day of the season to have any chance of a top-four finish, Arsenal took an eighth-minute lead through Hector Bellerin. They did suffer a setback when Laurent Koscielny was sent off for a late lunge on Enner Valencia in the 14th minute, ruling him out of the FA Cup final, but doubled their lead through Alexis Sanchez in the 27th minute. Everton, who started with Ross Barkley on the bench, pulled a goal back through Romelu Lukaku's penalty after Rob Holding handled in the penalty area. Hector Bellerin celebrates scoring Arsenal's opener against Everton But the Gunners, who lost Alexis Sanchez to injury in the 68th minute, secured victory thanks to Aaron Ramsey's injury-time strike. Arsenal's victory was in vain though in terms of Champions League qualification as Liverpool cruised to a 3-0 victory at home to relegated Middlesbrough, while Manchester City hammered Watford 5-0. It means a first finish outside the top four for Arsenal during Arsene Wenger's tenure at the club and Europa League football next season, but attention will now turn to next week's FA Cup final against Premier League champions Chelsea at Wembley. Arsene Wenger cuts a dejected figure in the dugout at the Emirates Stadium Koscielny and Ramsey were both passed fit while Danny Welbeck was preferred up front to Olivier Giroud as Wenger stuck with the 3-4-3 formation which has served them well in recent weeks. There was no place in Everton's starting line-up for Barkley, whose future at Goodison Park is in doubt, and he was left on the substitutes' bench with Enner Valencia taking his place. Bellerin gave Leighton Baines a torrid time in the early stages and when Welbeck mis-kicked from five yards with the goal gaping, the full-back was on hand to slot Arsenal ahead. It was the perfect start for the hosts, who had dominated the first quarter of an hour, but their momentum was checked when Koscielny dived needlessly in on Valencia and referee Michael Oliver responded with a red card. Laurent Koscielny is sent off by Michael Oliver Barkley came on for Tom Davies, presumably to take advantage of Arsenal's reduced numbers, but instead it was the 10 men that doubled their lead as Sanchez's shot fell to Welbeck, who in turn pulled back for Sanchez to pass the ball into the net. Everton improved with half-time in sight and could have scored when Barkley, Idrissa Gueye and Lukaku all shot in quick succession, but failed to convert. Gabriel is stretchered off against Everton at the Emirates Liverpool had taken the lead at Anfield shortly before the interval and word quickly spread when they doubled their lead early in the second half. A nightmare five minutes then ensued as Gabriel left the field on a stretcher following a lunging tackle on Valencia, Liverpool scored a third and Everton reduced the deficit after a Holding handball allowed Lukaku to fire a penalty into the corner, taking his goal tally to 25 for the season Romelu Lukaku celebrates his 25th goal of the season It was enough to prompt Arsenal's fans into a chant urging Stan Kroenke to leave, and there were more boos when Valencia, deemed by some fans to have exaggerated Koscielny's earlier tackle, was substituted late on. Substitute Alex Iwobi twice should have put the result beyond doubt and his wastefulness was almost punished when Barkley flashed wide. Alexis Sanchez (C) celebrates scoring with Aaron Ramsey (L) and Danny Welbeck (R) Ramsey added a final flourish, however, bending into the far top corner as Arsenal confirmed victory, but it proved to be in vain as the Gunners finished fifth for the first time since the 1995/96 season.

Sam Vokes put Burnley in front in the 23rd minute as he slotted home Andre Gray's cross, but the Hammers were level four minutes later after Sofiane Feghouli finished off a fine move. Ayew headed home from close range in the 72nd minute to complete the turnaround and put the Hammers on course for just a third win in 14 league outings, relieving some of the pressure on manager Slaven Bilic's shoulders. Andre Ayew celebrates his winning goal at Turf Moor The three points means the Hammers climbed up table to finish the season in 11th to earn themselves that additional prize money, while Burnley missed the chance boost the coffers, dropping to finish in 16th. Burnley brought Gray back into the side in place of Ashley Barnes, and the Clarets hitman almost had an immediate impact, but he got his lofted effort all wrong with Adrian stranded, and the ball drifted harmlessly wide. Down the other end, a man back in the Hammers side - Feghouli - brought the ball down on his chest before being denied by a smart stop from Tom Heaton. Sofiane Feghouli (second left) is congratulated on scoring his team's equaliser James Tarkowski wasted a golden chance to break the deadlock, but could not guide his header on target from close range. The home crowd didn't have to wait long for a goal, however, as Gray burst down the right, fed the ball across for the onrushing Scott Arfield, who missed it completely, but Vokes was on hand to net his 10th of the season just behind. Less than four minutes later we were back level again, as Feghouli finished off a fine move. Angelo Ogbonna fed the ball into Ayew, who flicked the ball through for Feghouli first time, before the impressive former Valencia man fired home. Sam Vokes celebrates scoring Burnley's opening goal Feghouli then should have put the Hammers in front, but blasted over with the goal at his mercy following a fortunate ricochet. After the break, the tempo slowed somewhat as neither side could conjure any real openings of note. It took until 18 minutes from time for the half's first goalmouth action, and it proved to be the game's deciding moment. Vokes coolly slotted home to put his side in front Edimilson Fernandes saw his thunderous effort brilliantly saved by Tom Heaton, but he could only beat the ball up into the air, it came down, hit the crossbar, and landed right on Ayew's head, a few yards out, and he just stood there, let the ball hit him and go into the net. Manuel Lanzini curled a free-kick just over the top as the Hammers went in search of a third, but the two goals proved to be enough for a final day flourish.

The Blues legend, who has spent 22 years at the club but will leave this summer, played 26 minutes after starting his second match in a row and was replaced to a standing ovation and a guard of honour from his team-mates. Willian's equaliser (8) had already cancelled out Javier Manquillo's third-minute strike by that point, and Eden Hazard (61) and Pedro (77) scored after the break to put the hosts in control. Terry's final Chelsea match could be the FA Cup final against Arsenal if he features Substitute Michy Batshuayi grabbed a late double (90, 90+2) to seal a record-breaking 30th Premier League victory this season. It was the perfect prelude to the lifting of the trophy after the match and for Chelsea's FA Cup final against Arsenal on Saturday. Terry started his final home match as Conte fielded a strong XI but the Blues fell behind to a shock Sunderland opener after just three minutes. Sebastian Larsson's free-kick hit the wall and broke kindly for Manquillo, who smashed home his first senior goal. The response by the champions was swift and they levelled through Willian five minutes later. They kept the ball alive after Marcos Alonso's superbly struck set-piece came back off the woodwork and the Brazilian's low shot sneaked past Jordan Pickford. Diego Costa volleyed wide and Victor Moses blazed over as Chelsea threatened to run riot before Terry's farewell took centre stage on 26 minutes. John Terry applauds fans as he leaves the pitch The Blues' No 26 was replaced by Gary Cahill in a pre-planned substitution, allowing Terry to say an emotional goodbye to his footballing home since 1995. The visitors went closest before the break when John O'Shea fired straight at Thibaut Courtois and the Chelsea 'keeper was called into action again in the second half when he turned away Jack Rodwell's header. The saves proved crucial as already-relegated Sunderland were blown away by a flurry of Chelsea goals in the final 30 minutes. Hazard's 16th of the season put them ahead after good work by Costa, who seemed to savour the moment when he was substituted late on. Diego Costa reacts during the match The striker - reportedly a summer transfer target for Chinese Super League clubs - waved to all corners of the ground before embracing team-mates on the bench. Pedro added their third after capitalising on a mix-up between Joleon Lescott - making his full Sunderland debut - and goalkeeper Pickford. Chelsea's Gary Cahill said today was all about celebrating after they beat Sunderland 5-1 Chelsea's Gary Cahill said today was all about celebrating after they beat Sunderland 5-1 And the Blues sealed their triumph with two strikes by Batshuayi in the closing stages. The former Marseille forward, whose goal at West Brom sealed the title, poked in from Pedro's pass and looked offside when curling home their fifth goal in added time. Chelsea finish the season as champions for the fifth time in 13 years and will now turn their attention towards Saturday's FA Cup final. They have also become the first top-flight team in history to win 30 games in a 38-game season, breaking their previous best mark set in 2004/05 and 2005/06.

successive season after scoring a hat-trick as Tottenham thrashed relegated Hull 7-1 on the final day. The striker, who netted four in a 6-1 win at Leicester on Thursday, followed up with two goals inside the opening 15 minutes at the KCOM Stadium. Dele Alli made it 3-0 before half-time and, after Sam Clucas pulled a goal back in the 66th minute, Spurs finished with a flourish. Victor Wanyama headed in before Kane completed his hat-trick and Ben Davies and Toby Alderweireld scored their first Premier League goals of the season. Kane wins the Golden Boot award with 29 goals, four more than nearest rival Romelu Lukaku. And the rout concludes another impressive campaign for Spurs, who finish second behind Chelsea on 86 points with just four defeats and a club-record 26 goals conceded. .@HKane becomes the 2nd Tottenham player to win the top division Golden Boot in successive seasons since Jimmy Greaves 1963-65 pic.twitter.com/jNDImHRdh0 — Sky Sports Statto (@SkySportsStatto) May 21, 2017 Hull, meanwhile, drop to the Championship with uncertainty over the future of Marco Silva, who was serenaded by fans throughout the match in a bid to keep him at the club, with talks planned next week. Spurs lost 5-1 to already relegated Newcastle on the final day last season but were clearly eager to avoid a similar result, with Christian Eriksen and Kieran Trippier returning to the starting XI. In potentially his final game in charge of Hull, Silva made six changes, giving goalkeeper David Marshall his first league start since January 2 and including youngsters Josh Tymon and Jarrod Bowen. Kane celebrates with Kieran Trippier But Spurs wasted little time taking control, with Kane firing home from the edge of the box after 11 minutes before tapping in Trippier's pass across goal shortly afterwards to make it 2-0. The striker then shot wide as Spurs controlled the first half and kept Hull on the defensive. With Oumar Niasse often isolated, the hosts did not muster a shot on target before half-time and they fell further behind in injury-time as Heung-Min Son pulled back for Alli to finish. Son was denied by Marshall early in the second half, but the introduction of Kamil Grosicki helped Hull improve and, after Niasse fired over, Clucas pulled a goal back in the 66th minute. The strike meant Hugo Lloris could not win the Golden Glove along with Thibaut Courtois, but only served to spring Spurs back into top gear. Eriksen's volley was brilliantly kept out by Marshall, but the 'keeper could do nothing as Wanyama headed in from a free-kick and Kane then finished after being played in by Alli. Davies rifled in a shot from the edge of the box in the 85th minute and Alderweireld completed the rout when he volleyed in from Trippier's cross.

The draw leaves Leicester 12th - the lowest ever finish for a reigning Premier League champion - while Bournemouth end the season ninth after going unbeaten in their last five games. Stanislas got Bournemouth off to the perfect start, tapping home on the rebound after less than a minute played. Vardy levelled six minutes after the break, while the striker was then denied a second by the offside flag midway through the half as Leicester finished the game on top. A summer of speculation awaits Vardy and a handful of Leicester's key players after a tumultuous season, though the Foxes did finish strongly under Craig Shakespeare after seeing their title defence falter - with a journey to the Champions League quarter-finals set to live long in the memory. Leicester finished with eight wins under Shakespeare (D3 L5) inc. seven PL wins from 12 Bournemouth caught Leicester napping at the back after less than a minute played, as Lys Mousset saw his effort parried before it fell kindly for Stanislas to stroke home the rebound. The visitors continued to impress after Stanislas' third goal in three games, with Kasper Schmeichel doing well to tip over Dan Gosling's powerful effort from 20 yards out. Leicester's first shot on target came in the 37th minute, but Riyad Mahrez's low strike was comfortably saved by Ryan Allsop after the Algerian cut onto his left foot at the back post. The hosts twice came within inches of levelling before half-time, but Yohan Benalouane saw his effort deflect wide before Islam Slimani headed narrowly beyond the far post from the resulting corner. Jamie Vardy's equaliser earned Leicester City a point against Bournemouth It took Leicester just six minutes to level after half-time, with Slimani heading Marc Albrighton's ball back across goal for Vardy to have the easiest of tap-ins. Ten minutes later, Vardy had the ball in the back of the net after latching onto Slimani's deflected strike, but the offside flag went up in a call that could have gone either way. Leicester continued to dominate with Vardy forcing a save Allsop into a couple of saves before Slimani somehow headed wide after finding himself in acres of space at the back post. Bournemouth ultimately held on for the point and must be commended for a ninth-placed finish in what is only their second season in the Premier League. Bournemouth finish the season ninth, improving on their 16th placed finish last year The Cherries' total of 46 points is four greater than their first season - where they ended 16th - and Eddie Howe will hope to push on in their third campaign in the top tier. Meanwhile, Leicester finish the season having taken eight wins from Shakespeare's 16 games in charge - including seven wins from 12 in the Premier League. It was a disappointing defence of their league title, but the Foxes will be delighted with 12th having found themselves in the relegation mix before Claudio Ranieri's sacking.

Goals from Georginio Wijnaldum, Philippe Coutinho and Adam Lallana meant that Jurgen Klopp - in his second season in charge - guided the Reds into the top four for just the second time in the last seven seasons. The result saw Arsenal miss out on Champions League football for the first in 20 years by finishing fifth, while Manchester City will join Liverpool in playing Europe's elite after they finished third. Klopp's men will face a two-legged play-off in August to make the Champions League group stage. Georginio Wijnaldum celebrates opening the scoring For already-relegated Middlesbrough, who had a strong appeal for a penalty for a foul on Patrick Bamford turned down at 0-0, this defeat was their 18th consecutive away game without a win - the club's longest run since 1980. Klopp welcomed back Roberto Firmino in place of Divock Origi and there was another start for Daniel Sturridge, who was making back-to-back starts for the first time since November. In a very nervy opening half, Middlesbrough sat deep and soaked up Liverpool's possession game with only Coutinho looking likely of unlocking the visitors' defence. He tested Brad Guzan's gloves with a few long distance crosses and shots but the Boro goalkeeper was equal to the test. With Arsenal winning at home to Everton, nerves started to grow around the ground as Liverpool continued to struggle in the final third. Liverpool's Brazilian midfielder Philippe Coutinho celebrates scoring his team's second goal The anxiety levels would've been turned up another notch had referee Martin Atkinson awarded Boro a penalty after 22 minutes. Patrick Bamford burst in behind Dejan Lovren and the defender, who was the last man, seemed to bundle the striker to the ground inside the penalty. Atkinson waved away the appeals and it was a decision Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville labelled \"terrible\". With half-time approaching and Klopp looking frustrated on the touchline, Wijnaldum changed the complexion of the game with the opening goal. He latched onto a clever flick from Firmino, strode into the area and fired a powerful effort past Guzan at his near post. Liverpool players celebrate Adam Lallana's goal After half-time, Liverpool were much more comfortable in possession in the final third and Sturridge showed a quick change of direction after 50 minutes to win a free-kick about 25 yards out. Coutinho stepped up and whipped a clever low effort into the far corner - the third time he has scored directly from a free-kick this season. Liverpool made it 3-0 after 56 minutes with Lallana netting his first goal of 2017 after a swift counter attack following a Boro corner. The lead was an unassailable one for Boro to chase as Coutinho volleyed just wide of the post from another quick break before picking out Firmino on his own in the area only for his strike partner to fluff his lines.

Crystal Palace. Jose Mourinho picked a young side at Old Trafford ahead of the Europa League final against Ajax on Wednesday, and 21-year-old Harrop benefitted by opening the scoring in the 15th minute with a fine run and finish from 12 yards. Paul Pogba added a second four minutes later, shooting low past Wayne Hennessey inside the box after Jesse Lingard's pacey run. Palace hit the post in the second half through Christian Benteke's header, but it stayed 2-0, meaning United finish the season in sixth, 24 points off winners Chelsea, while Palace end up in 14th. As expected, there was a nod to the future at Old Trafford on the final day of the season, with Mourinho fielding United's youngest-ever Premier League XI, averaging 22 years and 284 days old. Joel Pereira started in goal, while Scott McTominay made his first start and Demetri Mitchell made his debut, but it was Harrop who impressed most. Paul Pogba celebrates scoring Manchester United's second goal against Crystal Palace Also making his first appearance for the senior side, Harrop took just 15 minutes to get on the scoresheet, latching onto Pogba's fine ball, driving into the area and finding the far corner with a superb effort. Pogba turned scorer minutes later, finishing under Hennessey after Jesse Lingard had broke from his own half and fed the Frenchman inside the box. There was a lack of chances for the hosts in the second half, as Benteke did hit the foot of the post after rising highest in the penalty area, before Luka Milivojevic forced a good save from Pereira with a 20-yard free-kick. Sixteen-year-old Angel Gomes became United's youngest debutant since Duncan Edwards, and the first player to play in the Premier League born in 2000, when he came on with five minutes remaining for Wayne Rooney.

final day of the season. Jack Butland recovered from a calamitous first-half error that almost gave Southampton the lead to consistently deny the Saints late on in the game after Crouch had nodded Stoke ahead on the hour mark. James Ward-Prowse, Steven Davis and substitute Manolo Gabbiadini were all denied by Butland, as the Southampton players ended the season to a chorus of boos around St Mary's and cries of 'you don't know what you're doing' directed to Claude Puel. Puel's future remains uncertain at the club despite an eighth-placed finish, while Stoke end the campaign in 13th following the win thanks to top-scorer Crouch's seventh top-flight goal. Mame Biram Diouf was switched from striker to right wing-back to accommodate Crouch in Stoke's changed 3-4-3 formation, and brought a strong save from Fraser Forster within a minute in an electric opening. Nathan Redmond probed behind Charlie Austin, making his first start since December in place of Gabbiadini, but Stoke batted away cross after cross as Southampton piled on the pressure. Austin finally met a driven cross from Bertrand in the 34th minute, but fired wide as he slid in under pressure from Bruno Martins Indi. James Ward-Prowse in action at St Mary's The best drama came in the last 60 seconds of the half though as Southampton failed to clear a corner and Diouf's follow-up header was cleared off the line - setting up a Saints counter-attack. Butland, way out of goal, dwelled far too long on the ball after rushing out and Redmond nicked the ball off him before hitting the bar with his attempted lob as the sides went in goalless at the break. Mark Hughes switched to a four-man defence in the second half and it paid dividends on 60 minutes, when Geoff Cameron - moved to right-back - got to the byline and stood the ball up for Crouch to head in at the back post. Peter Crouch is the only player to reach double figures for Stoke this season after his goal against Southampton Puel responded by bringing on Gabbiadini and Sofiane Boufal for Austin and Dusan Tadic five minutes later much to the displeasure of the home fans, and both substitutes tested Butland late on. After a brilliant double-save to stop Davis and Ward-Prowse on 73 minutes, Butland rushed out to block Gabbiadini one-on-one moments later. Mark Hughes is 7th manager to win 150 PL games.

the Premier League season. The Swans went into the Liberty Stadium contest assured of survival and on a run of four games unbeaten, but fell behind in the 33rd minute as Jonny Evans nodded the Baggies in front. But Jordan Ayew netted his first Swansea goal since his January move to level things up in the 72nd minute before top scorer Llorente hit home with five minutes of normal time remaining to seal the three points. Paul Clement's men have ended the season in 15th place with 41 points while West Brom sneaked a top 10 finish on goal difference despite failing to win any of their final nine Premier League games. The sides mostly traded possession in the opening stages of the game. Salomon Rondon had the first chance in the 11th minute but could only direct his header into the hands of Kristoffer Nordfeldt before Leroy Fer fired over the crossbar at the near post a few minutes later. Leroy Fer puts pressure on Salomon Rondon at the Liberty Stadium Rondon was again testing the goalkeeper after 20 minutes as Darren Fletcher slid a lovely ball into the Venezuelan's feet to put him through one-on-one with Nordfeldt, but the Swansea stopper saved again. The home side could twice have taken the lead as the game reached the half hour, with Fer toe-poking an effort wide before Federico Fernandez nodded a Kyle Naughton cross past the post. But West Brom found the breakthrough in the 33rd minute with their 16th goal from a corner this season - the highest in the Premier League - as Fletcher's whipped delivery found the unmarked Evans at the back post to nod home. 16 - West Brom have now scored 16 goals from corners in the Premier League this term; the most of any team.

Gylfi Sigurdsson delivered a free kick in the 52nd minute that met the head of Llorente but the West Brom defence managed to clear in a packed box before Fernandez headed wide. Llorente then saw an effort saved by Ben Foster before Alfie Mawson headed the resulting corner wide. Fernando Llorente celebrates his winner against West Bromwich Albion But the home side got their equaliser in the 72nd minute and it was a first in a Swansea shirt for Ayew. It was another fine free-kick delivery from Sigurdsson to find Llorente at the back post. He in turn nodded back across for the Ghana international in the middle who headed past Foster into the bottom corner. Llorente rounded off Swansea's comeback with 13 minutes remaining as he scored his 15th goal of the Premier League campaign. Ayew fed Luciano Narsingh down the right-hand side of the box and his floated cross was volleyed home by the Spaniard. Evans could have spoiled the survival party in the final minute of injury time as he tried his luck at the near post, but Nordfeldt denied him as Swansea saw out the game and ended the season five games unbeaten.

Needing a point to book their place in Europe's elite-club competition next term, captain Vincent Kompany's fifth-minute header eased the early City nerves at Vicarage Road. Two Sergio Aguero goals in 13 first-half minutes, and a fourth from Fernandinho before half-time, put the game beyond the makeshift Watford outfit Walter Mazzarri named for his final game at the club. And things went from bad to worse for the Hornets as Gabriel Jesus' capped a fine City performance with their fifth on 58 minutes. The result confirms City's place in the group stages of next season's Champions League, while Watford finish a disappointing campaign just one place above the relegation zone. Mazzarri sprung a surprise on his final outing as Watford boss, naming captain Troy Deeney and two goalkeepers among his substitutes, while Gael Clichy replaced Aleksandar Kolarov for City at left-back. But it was another defender, Kompany, who made the early impact, rising highest to head Kevin De Bruyne's corner beyond Heurelho Gomes. Jesus should have doubled City's lead on 17 minutes, but his decision to square to Aguero allowed Watford to clear. Aguero called Gomes into a point-blank save moments later but managed to breach the Brazilian's defences on 23 minutes, drilling low into the bottom corner after De Bruyne's incisive through pass. Having found his scoring touch, Aguero doubled his tally on 36 minutes, applying the finishing touch to a scintillating counter which started with goalkeeper Willy Caballero. Three then became four as Fernandinho bundled his way through a crumbling Watford defence and poked past Gomes four minutes before the interval. Allowed to regroup at the break, Stefano Okaka's fierce drive, which drew a fine save from Caballero, raised the spirits of the home faithful. Mazzarri then received a lecture from referee Jon Moss, and Watford's fans began to call for him to be sent to the stands. Normal service soon resumed on the hour though, when Jesus stole in ahead of Tom Cleverley to scoop Aguero's cross over Gomes. Deeney's omission and then introduction with the Hornets trailing 5-0 - which received the biggest cheer of the day from the home fans - again suggested all was not well between him and Mazzarri. It proved to be an acrimonious end to Mazzarri's year in charge but a satisfying finale - albeit not a particularly taxing one - for Pep Guardiola and City.

Tottenham took the lead midway through the first half through the England striker, sweeping home inside the box after Heung-Min Son's cross. Son then added a second on 36 minutes, finishing on the volley from 15 yards after Dele Alli's delightful scooped assist, before Ben Chilwell made it 2-1 following some questionable goalkeeping by Hugo Lloris after the break. Kane scored his second of the game, heading in from close range on 63 minutes, and Son made it four with 20 minutes remaining, finishing well into the bottom corner from 20 yards after Kane had fed him. But Kane had the last say once again, firing home from 20 yards late on for 5-1, before adding a fourth with another low effort from the edge of the box past Kasper Schmeichel, taking his tally to 26 for the season, two ahead of Everton's Romelu Lukaku in the Premier League scoring charts. Mauricio Pochettino put out a strong Tottenham side despite having second place already secured, and though they had much of the play early on, the first chance fell to Leicester. Kane celebrates Spurs' third goal with team-mates at the King Power Jamie Vardy forced Hugo Lloris into a good save after Riyad Mahrez slipped him through on goal on 10 minutes, but it was one-way traffic thereafter. Son missed a golden chance to give Spurs the lead, blazing over the bar from 15 yards after Alli's through ball, but it was 1-0 on 25 minutes. Having got to the byline, Son cut back for Kane, who swept home from eight yards, despite the ball being slightly behind him. The creator turned scorer 11 minutes later, as Son volleyed home into the bottom corner from 15 yards after Alli's superb chipped pass over the top of the Leicester defence. Leicester improved after the break, and though Son went close with an acrobatic effort from Kane's dinked ball, the hosts soon halved the deficit. Lloris made a hash of his clearance as he came rushing out of the penalty area, allowing Wilfred Ndidi to feed Chilwell, who composed himself and slotted home for his first senior goal as the Spurs goalkeeper slipped attempting to get back. Riyad Mahrez vies with Tottenham's Eric Dier But Spurs regained their two-goal cushion just four minutes later through Kane, nodding home from close range after Moussa Sissoko had headed the ball back across goal from a Toby Alderweireld cross. Son got his second on 71 minutes, curling beyond Schmeichel into the bottom corner from 20 yards after Kane's pass in midfield to make it 4-1, before Kane himself took over the game. Kane grabbed his hat-trick on 89 minutes, cutting inside on the edge of the box before firing brilliantly past Schmeichel at his near post from 20 yards. Minutes later it was six for Spurs and four for Kane, again finishing into the bottom corner with a fierce effort from the edge of the box. Kane has now scored 96 goals for Spurs at the age of just 23, and is the first Tottenham player since Jimmy Greaves in 1968/69 to score four hat-tricks in a season.

Southampton at St Mary's Stadium. The United goalkeeper, who was starting in place of David de Gea, denied Gabbiadini after Eric Bailly was adjudged to have handled a high ball despite replays showing the incident occurred outside the penalty box. There were chances for both sides to win it after that, with Romero keeping Southampton at bay and Anthony Martial striking the post for United, but a breakthrough never arrived. Jose Mourinho rotated his side again with one eye on next week's Europa League final, making four changes from Sunday's 2-1 defeat to Tottenham and leaving the likes of Marcus Rashford, Ander Herrera and Michael Carrick on the bench. Claude Puel also made wholesale alterations from his side's 2-1 win at Middlesbrough, and the much-changed Saints should have had an early opener when Gabbiadini was denied from the spot after just six minutes. It was a lucky escape for United, and Bailly almost made amends for his error when his low shot was saved by Fraser Forster a few minutes later. Martial then dragged an effort wide after he was played in by Wayne Rooney, but the game reached half-time with little other goalmouth action. Southampton stepped up the tempo after the break, with Romero parrying a powerful free kick from Dusan Tadic after Phil Jones had felled Cedric Soares on the edge of the box. The United 'keeper was called into action again shortly afterwards, first denying Saints midfielder Oriol Romeu, then acrobatically tipping a curling strike from James Ward-Prowse around the post. Mourinho threw on Carrick, Herrera and Rashford in the closing stages, but it was Martial who came closest to breaking the deadlock. The Frenchman charged forward before bending his shot off the post with Fraser Forster beaten. The onrushing Mkhitaryan could only blast the rebound earlier. Southampton did most of the attacking in the final stages, but there was no separating the two sides, with the draw keeping them sixth and eighth respectively.

The Chilean scored simple goals in the 72nd and 81st minutes to put Arsene Wenger's side within one point of fourth-place Liverpool ahead of Sunday's final round of Premier League fixtures. Arsenal will now look to beat Everton in their final match and hope Liverpool drop points against relegated Middlesbrough if they are to maintain their record of finishing in the top-four in each of Wenger's 21 seasons in charge. They could mathematically still catch third-placed Manchester City, who beat West Brom 3-1 on Tuesday night, but that scenario would require defeat for Pep Guardiola's side at Watford with Arsenal enjoying a five-goal swing on the final day. Arsenal would have expected to have improved their goal difference against a Sunderland team which will definitely now finish the season bottom, but David Moyes matched Arsenal's back three system and his side frustrated their hosts for long spells. Aaron Ramsey takes on Lee Cattermole Sanchez was passed fit to start and thought he had created the opening goal on eight minutes, but his long-range strike deflected off the arm of Olivier Giroud as it beat Jordan Pickford and was correctly disallowed. Three minutes later, Giroud wasted the best chance of the first half when he collected Aaron Ramsey's pass inside the six-yard box, but his shot was kept out by Pickford's outstretched hand. There were thousands of empty seats at the Emirates Stadium and those that turned up were not treated to a first-half goal. Petr Cech denied Didier Ndong and Jermain Defoe, while Hector Bellerin struck the side-netting instead of picking out Sanchez. Sanchez celebrates putting Arsenal ahead The second half opened in farcical circumstances as Nacho Monreal's 40-yard back-pass almost beat a stranded Cech, who conceded an indirect free-kick as he clawed it away. Seb Larsson's subsequent set-piece from six yards was headed over by Granit Xhaka. Giroud glanced Monreal's cross just wide and Pickford kept out Danny Welbeck's low drive before Sanchez finally made the breakthrough with 18 minutes left. Xhaka's lofted ball into the penalty area found Mesut Ozil on the left of the six-yard box and his first-time ball was tapped into an empty net by Sanchez to the relief of the below-capacity home crowd. Sanchez chipped a cheeky effort onto the bar and Pickford produced two superb saves to deny Xhaka and substitute Alex Iwobi before Arsenal wrapped up the points with nine minutes left. Granit Xhaka puts Fabio Borini under pressure in the early stages at the Emirates The inspired Pickford brilliantly pushed away Giroud's close-range volley, but the ball fell to Sanchez, who was perhaps fractionally offside as he headed the ball into an empty net from two yards. Pickford still had time to push a late Shkodran Mustafi header onto the bar, but the goalkeeper's heroics could not prevent Arsenal from taking their late-season top-four charge down to the final day.

Pep Guardiola's side needed to better the result of Arsenal to seal their place in the Champions League spots before the final game of the season on Sunday, but must now wait until the final match as the Gunners beat Sunderland 2-0 on Tuesday evening. City scored two quick first-half goals with Gabriel Jesus opening the scoring in the 27th minute before Kevin de Bruyne added the second two minutes later with a fine curling strike. Yaya Toure scored his first home goal of the season 12 minutes into the second half, with Hal Robson-Kanu netting a consolation for West Brom in the 87th minute but it was ultimately a comfortable win for the hosts. City move above Liverpool into third and will now need a point away to Watford on the final day of the season to secure their top-four place - and even if they were to lose it would take a five-goal swing for fifth-place Arsenal to overhaul them. Meanwhile the Baggies have now gone eight games without a victory and remain on 45 points with a trip to Swansea on Sunday. Gabriel Jesus opened the scoring in the first half at the Etihad The game took a while to get going in the opening exchanges with City seeing the majority of possession. Leroy Sane had a penalty call waved away by referee Craig Pawson in the 13th minute after going down under pressure from Allan Nyom before Aleksandar Kolarov forced a fine save from Ben Foster with a free-kick a minute later. Sane was involved once again not long after as he powered into the box and took a few seconds to shape his shot, but he could only put the shot wide of the post with a rare West Brom effort coming in the 25th minute as Nacer Chadli fired a free-kick straight into the hands of Willy Caballero. 1:46 - There were just one minute and 46 seconds between the goals by Gabriel Jesus and Kevin De Bruyne. Vibrant. — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) May 16, 2017 But City found their shooting boots two minutes later as Jesus opened the scoring. Sergio Aguero released De Bruyne down the left and he squared for his team-mate who knocked home from close range. The Belgian was involved again shortly after as the hosts doubled their lead, latching onto a poor clearance from the West Brom defence before powering home from the top of the box, bending the ball past Ben Foster. Kevin De Bruyne scored a fine second goal for Man City City could have added a few more before the half was over as Aguero thrashed an effort straight at the Baggies goalkeeper before Sane tried his luck with five minutes to play but despite a fine cut-back from Jesus, he could only lift the ball over the crossbar. Guardiola's side once again dominated the game in the second half, and added a third to their tally in the 57th minute through Toure. He played a fine give-and-go with Aguero before racing through on goal and slotting home for his fifth goal of the Premier League season.

Jesus could have nabbed his second of the evening with just over 20 minutes of the game to play as he danced his way through the middle of three West Brom shirts before unleashing a fierce drive, but Foster was equal to it, leaping to push it behind. Gabriel Jesus vies with Jake Livermore during the Premier League match City continued to dominate proceedings as the game drew towards its conclusion with Aguero shooting just wide in the 74th minute before Foster was once again on hand to deny Jesus a second of the game ten minutes later, twice saving from the efforts of the young Brazilian at the near post. But West Brom managed to pull a goal back with three minutes of normal time to play although it was merely a consolation as Nyom drove towards the touchline before pulling back for Robson-Kanu who slotted home past Caballero.

celebrated winning the Premier League title with a thrilling 4-3 victory over Watford on Monday amid a party atmosphere at Stamford Bridge. The Blues made nine changes from the team that clinched the title at West Brom on Friday, and it was departing captain Terry who scored the opener from a corner in the 22nd minute. Terry appeared to have tears in his eyes after the celebrations but, less than 90 seconds later, it was his miscued header that gifted Etienne Capoue the equaliser. Cesar Azpilicueta and Michy Batshuayi scored either side of half-time to make it 3-1 to Chelsea, only for Daryl Janmaat to reply with a fine individual goal before substitute Stefano Okaka levelled in the 74th minute.

Their final game is v Sunderland (H) pic.twitter.com/DEE9QE5dWV — Sky Sports Statto (@SkySportsStatto) May 15, 2017 But Cesc Fabregas came off the bench to snatch the winner with two minutes remaining and Sebastian Prodl was sent off in a fiery finish before fireworks and streamers filled the air. The champions now finish the campaign at Stamford Bridge against Sunderland on Sunday when they will lift the Premier League trophy, and a victory would see them finish on 93 points, the second-highest tally behind Jose Mourinho's 2004/05 Chelsea side, and become the first side to win 30 games in a Premier League season. Watford, meanwhile, could end just a point above the relegation zone if they lose to Manchester City on the last day. Terry saluted the fans after scoring Having secured the title on Friday, and perhaps with one eye on the FA Cup final on May 27, Antonio Conte made nine changes to his starting line-up from the win over West Brom. After being given a guard of honour, Chelsea took their time to settle into their stride, and it was Terry who put them ahead in the 22nd minute when he finished from a corner. Terry's celebrations soon turned to frustrations, though, as he headed up into the air in his own box and Capoue nodded in from close range. Batshuayi celebrates Chelsea's third goal and his second in as many games Eden Hazard dragged a shot wide on the half-hour mark before Azpilicueta restored Chelsea's lead when he fired in after a corner came out to him on the edge of the box. Batshuayi made it 3-1 when he tapped in from Nathan Ake's pass shortly after half-time, only for Janmaat to quickly reply with a fine individual goal, driving down the left side and then finishing into the far corner. Heurelho Gomes denied Batshuayi at close range and then tipped a low shot from Azpilicueta wide. Watford levelled when substitute Okaka fired in, but Fabregas made it 4-3 when he finished from the edge of the area with two minutes remaining. The Hornets finished with 10 men as Prodl was dismissed, and tempers flared up again before the final whistle went and fireworks shot into the sky to celebrate Chelsea's title win.

In a game they could ill-afford to lose, Hull got off to a nightmare start as Andrea Ranocchia's third-minute error presented Wilfried Zaha with the opener, before Christian Benteke notched his sixth goal in nine games on 34 minutes. Harry Maguire looks on dejected as Palace race into the lead Hull were incensed Zaha was not penalised for handball in the build-up to Palace's second, while they were also denied a penalty for Jason Puncheon's clear handball. Marco Silva threw two extra forwards on at half-time but it was too little, too late for the toothless Tigers as a Luka Milivojevic penalty and Patrick van Aanholt's late strike settled the contest. The result sees Hull join Sunderland and Middlesbrough in the Sky Bet Championship and maintains Sam Allardyce's record of never being relegated from the top-flight. James Tomkins and Yohan Cabaye returned for Palace while Evandro and Michael Dawson - making his first start in four - were recalled as both managers made two changes ahead of the season-defining clash. 4 - This was Crystal Palace's joint-biggest winning margin in Premier League history (also 5-1 v Newcastle in Nov 2015). Savage. — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) May 14, 2017 Palace entered the game knowing they would secure their top-flight status if they avoided defeat, while Hull needed to win away for only the second time to keep their survival hopes alive. The visitors got off to the worst possible start as Ranocchia's mis-kicked clearance fell perfectly for Zaha, who settled the Selhurst Park nerves with a clinical third-minute finish. Yohan Cabaye congratulates Wilfried Zaha for his early strike One nearly became two on 10 minutes, but Tomkins' glancing header failed to punish Hull's motionless, zonal defence. The same motionless rearguard would cost the Tigers shortly after the half-hour mark as an unmarked Benteke was allowed to attack a corner, and his towering header doubled Palace's lead. 15 - Christian Benteke has scored 15 PL goals this season; the most since 2012-13, his debut campaign in English football (19). Mojo. — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) May 14, 2017 Hull protests, for a Zaha handball in the build-up, fell on deaf ears, and further insult was added when Kamil Grosicki's free-kick was blocked by Puncheon's arm. The offside flag came to Hull's rescue, preventing Palace from extending their lead before the interval, where Marco Silva sacrificed two defenders for forwards Shaun Maloney and Jarrod Bowen. Michael Dawson reacts as Hull City are relegated to the Championship And 20-year-old Bowen was presented with a great chance to spark a Hull revival on the hour, but, despite being unmarked in the area, he failed to steer Sam Clucas' cross on target. But that was as close as Hull came to rescuing themselves as Milivojevic, after Dawson hauled down Jeff Schlupp in the area, made it three from the spot before Van Aanholt secured a fifth successive Premier League season for the Eagles with the fourth in the final minute.

In his first Premier League start since January, Daniel Sturridge repaid Jurgen Klopp's faith by opening the scoring after 35 minutes. Philippe Coutinho then scored a quick double for the visitors after the break, hitting his second in controversial circumstances, before Divock Origi added Liverpool's fourth 14 minutes from time. The result means Liverpool will guarantee a top-four finish with victory at home to Middlesbrough on the final day next Sunday. And with Manchester City also in pole position to finish among the Champions League places, Arsenal must now rely on slip-ups from the other two as we enter the last week of the 2016/17 season. Klopp opted to hand Sturridge only his sixth league start of the season at West Ham, while Adam Lallana also returned to Liverpool's starting XI. West Ham, meanwhile, were looking to replicate the performance against Tottenham which saw them guarantee safety and all-but end the title race. And it was the hosts who enjoyed a bright start in their final home game of the season, with Sam Byram guilty of a missed opportunity early on after dragging his effort wide of the far post. An end-to-end half then saw Joel Matip rise highest to meet Coutinho's corner, but the defender's header bounced off the bar before Winston Reid cleared the danger. Simon Mignolet was then called into action, with the Liverpool goalkeeper only able to parry Edimilson Fernandes' half-volley from 25 yards out. Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool celebrates scoring his side's first goal with Adam Lallana during the Premier League match at West Ham Liverpool were looking dominant as the half progressed, and were rewarded for their efforts 10 minutes before the break. From halfway inside his own half, Coutinho played Sturridge through on goal - who was onside courtesy of some lax defending - and the Liverpool striker made no mistake when one-on-one with Adrian, rounding the West Ham 'keeper before sliding into the empty net. But despite a half which saw Liverpool enjoy 71% possession and 11 attempts on goal, it was West Ham who really should have levelled just before half-time. Manuel Lanzini's corner found its way to Andre Ayew at the back post, but from three yards out he could only hit the post before striking the upright once more on the rebound - with Mignolet then smothering the ball to prevent it from going over the line. West Ham United's Jonathan Calleri (left) and Liverpool's Georginio Wijnaldum battle for the ball Liverpool shot out the blocks after the break, calling Adrian into making a hat-trick of saves in the opening two minutes. The West Ham 'keeper tipped away Origi's effort before getting a boot to Lallana's fierce half-volley, while the third came after denying Gini Wijnaldum from 20 yards out. Wijnaldum then ratted a superb volley off the bar, but as the ball fell to Coutinho, the Brazilian weaved his way through the West Ham defence before driving an effort past Adrian to double Liverpool's lead. The third came in controversial circumstances as referee Neil Swarbrick failed to penalise Wijnaldum for a handball in his own area - a blistering counter-attack followed, with Coutinho slamming an effort beyond the helpless Adrian. A fourth arrived for Liverpool soon after, with Origi rolling in from six yards out after Wijnaldum's miscued effort. Victory leaves Liverpool four points above fifth-placed Arsenal, who do have a game in hand at home to Sunderland in midweek. Manchester City also face West Brom on Tuesday, live on Sky Sports 1, and victory or a draw for City would mean Arsenal have to at least draw with Sunderland to take their slim hopes of Champions League football to the final day.

Having called the famous stadium home for 118 years, they produced a strong performance to bid farewell in style. Victor Wanyama's powerful header opened the scoring (6) and Harry Kane scored his first top-flight goal against United two minutes after the break. Wayne Rooney threatened to spoil the party when he halved the deficit (71) but Tottenham held on in the pouring rain. The win means Spurs leave White Hart Lane without defeat this season ahead of a move to Wembley, with their new home set to be ready for the 2018/19 campaign. Jose Mourinho's side can no longer make the top four and must now beat Ajax in their Europa League final on May 24 to reach next season's Champions League. Tottenham Hotspur fans wave flags prior to the final match at White Hart Lane The hosts played up to the party atmosphere and struck after just six minutes. Wanyama peeled off Rooney and planted a header past David de Gea after an excellent deep cross by Ben Davies. It was the perfect start for Spurs against a United side that lacked energy in the first half, registering just one shot on target. With the Europa League final in mind, Mourinho made eight changes as Rooney captained the side and Paul Pogba missed out following the death of his father on Friday. Anthony Martial squandered their best chance of the first half, curling narrowly wide of the far post. And they were fortunate to go in at the break just one goal behind as De Gea made saves from Heung-Min Son, Dele Alli and Kane, while the Spurs forward also nodded over. The save to deny Son was particularly impressive, with the South Korean bundling through the United defence only to be thwarted by the Spanish goalkeeper. But his heroics proved to delay the inevitable as Tottenham capitalised on a fast start to the second half to double their lead. United failed to defend an Eriksen set-piece and Kane diverted in his 28th goal of the season. The new White Hart Lane is visible from the old stadium Jesse Lingard dragged a shot wide and Martial again curled inches past Hugo Lloris' far post as United's frustration mounted. Their improved play was rewarded on 71 minutes when Rooney turned home Martial's cross although the final touch came off Jan Vertonghen. And substitute Marcus Rashford wasted a stoppage-time chance to steal a point, slicing wide from Michael Carrick's fine through ball. Kieran Trippier was replaced late on after picking up an injury but otherwise it was the ideal Spurs sign off to their famous home. They end their season with visits to Leicester and relegated Hull City, while United travel to Southampton - live on Sky Sports - and conclude at home to Crystal Palace.

strengthened their grip on a top-four finish with a nervy 2-1 victory over dethroned champions Leicester. City took the lead in contentious circumstances, David Silva's 29th-minute strike allowed to stand despite Raheem Sterling's attempt to play the ball from an offside position. But there were no complaints with the hosts' second as Gabriel Jesus stroked a penalty home after Yohan Benalouane's clumsy foul on Leroy Sane. Shinji Okazaki's sumptuous volley reduced the arrears before half-time and Leicester thought they had snatched a point when Riyad Mahrez converted a 76th-minute penalty. But referee Robert Madley spotted Mahrez had struck the ball twice and disallowed the goal as City clung onto a victory that moved them up to third in the Premier League. Leicester, who see a two-game winning streak come to an end, remain ninth on 43 points. Leroy Sane is brought down in the box by Yohan Benalouane Five years on from his dramatic title-winning goal against QPR, there was no starting spot for Sergio Aguero as Pep Guardiola, in the wake of City's thumping victory over Crystal Palace, named an unchanged side for the first time this season. Andy King and Ben Chilwell replaced injured Leicester duo Danny Drinkwater and Robert Huth, whose absence saw Christian Fuchs deputise at centre-back. And it took Guardiola's men just four minutes to penetrate the makeshift Leicester defence, Fernandinho escaping Danny Simpson but heading Kevin de Bruyne's corner wide. 2 - David Silva has scored in back-to-back Premier League games for the first time since December 2014. Magician. — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) May 13, 2017 But it was not just the visitors who showed defensive frailties as the unmarked Wilfred Ndidi glanced Marc Albrighton's corner over on eight minutes. The breakthrough finally came shortly before the half-hour mark as Silva stroked Sane's cut-back beyond a stricken Kasper Schmeichel. Gabriel Jesus scores Manchester City's second from the penalty spot Sterling tried to help the effort on its way from an offside position, sparking mass protests from the Leicester players but, after consulting with his linesman, Madley awarded the goal. One soon became two as Benalouane sent Sane flying in the area and Jesus, after denying Yaya Toure the chance to score on his birthday, coolly converted from 12 yards. 23 - Shinji Okazaki has ended a run of 23 games in all competitions without scoring for Leicester. Rocket. — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) May 13, 2017 City, strolling towards the break with a two-goal lead, were stopped in their tracks as Okazaki spectacular improvised volley cut the hosts lead three minutes before the interval. And, after a subdued first-half display, the goal breathed life into the Foxes, Albrighton drawing Willy Caballero into action with a scuffed 49th-minute effort. Shinji Okazaki reduces Manchester City's lead to 2-1 After Fuchs blocked Sterling's goal-bound effort on 70 minutes, the visitors had a glorious chance to equalise when the second penalty of the game was awarded after Gael Clichy's foul on Mahrez. However, in bizarre circumstances, an eagle-eyed Madley correctly disallowed the goal after Mahrez slipped and struck the ball twice. Riyad Mahrez scores his penalty which is later disallowed for taking two touches Leicester maintained their threat deep into ten minutes of added time but Jamie Vardy's near-post flick was the closest they came as City signed off their season at the Etihad with a victory.

Resolution. — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) May 13, 2017 But King scored his 16th Premier League goal of the season just two minutes later to give Eddie Howe's side a deserved win and leave Burnley 14th in the top flight. Unchanged from draws in last weekend's fixtures, both mid-table sides looked as though they were already thinking about post-season holidays early on. Steve Cook, without a goal in 113 appearances, attempted a rather audacious shot from distance in the opening quarter's only real moment of excitement, both sets of fans cheering as it cleared the stand behind Burnley's goal. Junior Stanislas scored for the second consecutive Premier League game But Stanislas caught Stephen Ward, and everyone inside the Vitality, napping on 25 minutes when he latched onto a long diagonal from Lewis Cook and calmly stroked the ball past Tom Heaton to put the home side ahead. Sean Dyche brought on Andre Gray and Robbie Brady for the second half as Burnley raised the intensity, Scott Arfield stirring the pot with a whipped shot from distance that had Artur Boruc diving in the 57th minute. Scott Arfield came closest for Burnley Lys Mousset, kept in the starting line-up despite an own-goal on his full Premier League debut last week, then headed straight at Heaton from a looping cross before being withdrawn with cramp shortly after. With the game drifting into the afternoon sun undisturbed, Vokes stunned the home crowd with a superb glancing header into the top corner from Johann Berg Gudmundsson's cross on 83 minutes. Vokes put Burnley level with just seven minutes remaining But King got the wrong side of James Tarkowski just two minutes later to latch onto Ryan Fraser's low cross and ensure Bournemouth's players enjoyed their final home game lap of honour having claimed all three points.

"2:40 Middlesbrough 1-2 Southampton highlights Middlesbrough 1-2 Southampton highlights Southampton survived a late Middlesbrough fightback to earn a 2-1 victory at the Riverside Stadium. Three minutes before the end of a scrappy first half, Jay Rodriguez got on the end of a pinpoint Shane Long cross to fire his side into the lead, but it was the second 45 minutes where the best of the action took place. Firstly, Nathan Redmond scored a fine second in the 57th minute, before Long wasted a golden chance to put the game to bed seven minutes later, blazing a penalty over the bar. Jay Rodriguez celebrates his goal with team-mate Ryan Bertrand It looked like that miss could prove to be pivotal as Patrick Bamford headed his first-ever Premier League goal to get Boro back in it with 18 minutes remaining, but the home side couldn't muster an equaliser as their final home game ended in disappointment. The result means Middlesbrough are guaranteed to finish with their lowest Premier League points total, while Saints moved level on points with West Brom in eighth after a first success since April 8. Saints made seven changes to the side that were beaten by Arsenal in midweek, handing full debuts to Martin Caceres and Jeremy Pied, with the former called into action very early on to block well from Bamford. Patrick Bamford celebrates after pulling a goal back for Middlesbrough The hosts showed why they came into this encounter with just one win in their last 19 league games as they offered next to no threat to Fraser Forster's goal in the first half. Down the other end, Long was proving to be a real handful down the channels, and he almost created an opening in the 32nd minute, but Brad Guzan was down well to cut out the Saints forward's low cross. It wasn't long before Saints did put a telling move together, though, with Long at the heart of it once more. Jordy Clasie fed the Saints forward down the right channel, Long looked up, picked out the run of Rodriguez perfectly, and the former Burnley hitman fired home on the half volley. Maya Yoshida heads the ball away from a free kick Boro came out with added impetus after the break, and went close to an equaliser just minutes into the half, but Adam Forshaw saw his goal-bound strike deflected wide. Bamford wasted another chance to equalise when he sliced into the roof of the net, before Redmond made the hosts pay for their lack of potency, ruthlessly curling into the top corner after striding into the box, taking advantage of some slack Boro marking. Then came the moment that should have sealed the three points for Claude Puel's men. Long was always beating Guzan to the long ball, with the Boro stopper clumsy as he went to ground, upending Long and gifting the Saints forward the chance to get himself on the scoresheet from the spot. 760 - Patrick Bamford has scored his first competitive goal since netting for Middlesbrough v Wolves in April 2015 - 760 days ago. Overdue. — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) May 13, 2017 Long sent Guzan the wrong way, but got underneath his spot-kick, firing over, clipping the bar en route. Five minutes later and Boro were back in it. Substitute Viktor Fischer curled a perfect corner into the middle, Bamford stood his ground and diverted the ball home, with the side of his head. Whether he knew much about it is a different matter, but after more than two years without a goal, he won't mind. The goal did rouse the Teessiders to try snatch an unlikely point, with Forster forced into a fine stop to deny Calum Chambers in stoppage time, but Saints held on for the three points.

First-half goals from Fernando Llorente and Kyle Naughton handed Swansea their third win in four Premier League games, leaving them four points clear of 18th-placed Hull - who travel to Crystal Palace on Nissan Super Sunday. The result means Hull will go down if they lose to Palace, while a draw is unlikely to be good enough given their inferior goal difference. Fernando Llorente celebrates scoring the opening goal at the Stadium of Light Meanwhile, the Swansea players - who had paid for their fans to attend the match in the north east - ensured their 3,000 supporters left the Stadium of Light elated as they edged ever closer to safety. It was just the one change for Sunderland as Seb Larsson came in for the injured George Honeyman, while Paul Clement kept faith with the same Swansea XI which beat Everton last weekend. The visitors were on top from the off and were rewarded for their bright start when Llorente headed in his 14th league goal of the season. It came from another Gylfi Sigurdsson assist - his 13th this campaign - with the Icelandic's ball in met by Llorente ahead of Sunderland goalkeeper Jordan Pickford, who came rushing out to try and punch clear.

Giroud#PL @SwansOfficial — Sky Sports Statto (@SkySportsStatto) May 13, 2017 Despite a lacklustre first half from the hosts, they did have a couple of opportunities to equalise - firstly through Billy Jones, but he could only head wide from 10 yards out. Jermain Defoe was then denied from a narrow angle, as Lukasz Fabianski spread himself to deny the Sunderland forward following Jones' knockdown. The Swans upped the ante towards the end of the half however, and were rewarded when Naughton flashed an effort into the top corner from a tight angle in the third minute of added time. That was Naughton's first ever Premier League goal for Swansea in what was his 141st appearance, and it left the hosts with a mountain to climb after the break. Sunderland grew into the game in the second half, and they should have had a penalty when Sigurdsson stuck out an arm to block Seb Larsson's free-kick - but referee Andre Marriner waved away the Swede's furious protests. Paul Clement has seen his Swansea side pick up 10 points from their last four games With 20 minutes to go, Sunderland's Jones missed a gilt-edged chance as he could only fire agonisingly wide after Fabianski spilled Khazri's free-kick. Swansea failed to register a shot in the second half, but they withstood everything Sunderland threw at them to claim their first away win since January. Sunderland meanwhile went out with a whimper in their final Premier League match at the Stadium of Light for at least a year, while striker Jermain Defoe could be one of a handful of players to have played his final home game for the club.

The France striker put Arsenal ahead (42) and Mesut Ozil made it two (55) before Peter Crouch's controversial handball halved the deficit (67). But the excellent Alexis Sanchez restored the visitors' two-goal advantage (76) and Giroud added late gloss with their fourth (80). Alexis Sanchez scored before he was substituted with an apparent injury Manchester City's 2-1 victory over Leicester earlier on Saturday put pressure on Arsene Wenger's side but they responded to move within one point of fourth-placed Liverpool. Jurgen Klopp's team face West Ham at the London Stadium on Nissan Super Sunday. Defeat for Stoke in their final home match of the season means they have won just once since March 4 and are guaranteed to finish in the bottom half of the table. The only concern for Wenger will be the apparent injury picked up by Sanchez, who limped off shortly after scoring his 50th Premier League goal and may now be a doubt to face Sunderland on Tuesday. The Gunners boss made four changes from the 2-0 victory at Southampton but his side looked settled from the start. They dominated the first half and deservedly took the lead through Giroud three minutes before half-time. Preferred to Danny Welbeck after scoring at St Mary's, he tapped home after a smart run and cross by Hector Bellerin. The Gunners had earlier gone close through Nacho Monreal when the Spaniard's header rattled the woodwork and bounced clear. Rob Holding and Marko Arnautovic in action at the bet365 Stadium Shkodran Mustafi and Sanchez both had chances too and such was Arsenal's control, Stoke left the field at the break to boos from the home crowd. Their woes deepened shortly after the interval as Sanchez and Ozil combined beautifully to double the visitors' lead. The Chile forward threaded an inch-perfect pass to Ozil, who neatly lifted his finish over the advancing Jack Butland. Stoke finally rallied and should have pulled one back when Mame Biram Diouf nodded wide from Marko Arnautovic's low cross. But they made their pressure count minutes later, albeit in controversial circumstances. Arnautovic was again the creator as he burst past Rob Holding and crossed to the near post, where Crouch guided home via his right hand. It looked set to tee up a frantic final 20 minutes but Sanchez put the game beyond the hosts with the Gunners' third of the evening. Having picked up a thigh injury and signalled to the bench, he found the far corner of Butland's net with his final act before being substituted. Giroud made the points safe with his second of the match with 10 minutes remaining, turning in Aaron Ramsey's excellent delivery. The Welsh international also went close himself and Petr Cech saved well from Geoff Cameron as Arsenal passed a significant test of their top-four credentials.

The England international was issued with an ultimatum by manager Ronald Koeman on Thursday, who told the 23-year-old he has one more week to sign a new deal at Goodison Park or face being sold. Despite the demand, Barkley started for the hosts and then stepped up in the 56th minute to power home Everton's only goal from 25 yards out. Defeat for Watford means their Premier League safety is still not confirmed, while Everton can now draw a line under a three-game winless run. Build-up to the match was dominated by talk of Barkley, but 45 minutes before kick-off news broke of a different Everton midfielder committing his future to the club, with Kevin Mirallas penning a three-year contract extension. Watford meanwhile made three changes as they looked for the one point which would guarantee safety. The rain came down hard early on at Goodison Park But it was the hosts who started brightly under the Friday night lights at Goodison, with travelling goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes called into action early on. Barkley should have put the hosts ahead after some neat build up-play with Idrissa Gueye, but his strike from 10 yards out was too close to Gomes. Moments later, Gomes did well to deny Phil Jagielka from point-blank range before then turning Tom Davies' effort round the post. Watford did have their chances though, but Adrian Mariappa headed over and Abdoulaye Doucoure saw his deflected effort saved as it finished goalless at the break. 43 - Everton have won 43 points at Goodison Park in the PL this term, their most in a top-flight campaign at home since 1989-90 (45). Sweet. pic.twitter.com/sRlJdTJ7M5 — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) May 12, 2017 It was an inspired half-time substitution from Ronald Koeman which brought Everton to life, as Enner Valencia brought pace and vigour to his side, which was somewhat lacking in the opening 45. The returning Morgan Schneiderlin perhaps should have done better after Gomes punched a cross into the midfielder's direction, but he volleyed over from distance with the Watford 'keeper floundering. Troy Deeney then came close to breaking the deadlock, but the Watford skipper fired wide at the near post when he needed to glance it across goal. And just two minutes later, Watford were made to pay - Jagielka found Barkley, who stormed down the pitch unchallenged before sending an effort skidding past Gomes, who perhaps should have done better. Barkley went off to a standing ovation after 80 minutes Everton should have doubled their lead shortly after, but Schneiderlin headed over, and from then on it was Watford who looked more likely to score. Mariappa again headed wide and then at the death it was Okaka who latched onto a loose ball into the box but could only fire straight at Joel Robles. Everton clung on for victory in their final home game of the season, and their tally of 43 points at Goodison is their most in a top-flight campaign since 1989-90.

Batshuayi had not scored in the league since August but slid to meet a Cesar Azpilicueta cut-back in the 82nd minute - just moments after coming off the bench - to ensure the Blues secured a second league crown in three seasons and Antonio Conte triumphed at the first attempt. Chelsea had been frustrated during a goalless first half in which the hosts defended stubbornly, yet a game seemingly set for stalemate might have swung the other way had Salomon Rondon and Nacer Chadli finished fine second-half chances. Michy Batshuayi slides in to seal the goal that sealed the Premier League title for Chelsea Eden Hazard and Diego Costa had toiled in front of goal as Chelsea looked forced to wait at least until the weekend, but Batshuayi proved the unlikely hero to spark wild celebrations from Conte on the touchline at the final whistle. Tottenham's loss at West Ham last Friday and Chelsea's 3-0 defeat of Middlesbrough on Monday had meant the stage was set, and a dramatic late success at The Hawthorns means Conte's men have an unassailable 10-point lead over Spurs, who have three games to play. Tony Pulis had warned his side would do their \"damnedest\" to make Chelsea work for the prize and Rondon fired an early warning, beating David Luiz to a header that forced Thibaut Courtois to tip behind with just a minute on the clock. Eden Hazard takes on Sam Field in the early stages at The Hawthorns Cesc Fabregas, who starred in the win over Boro that put his team-mates on the brink, was soon plotting again, lofting a pass forward that Pedro miscued, before delivering an inswinging free-kick that just evaded Gary Cahill. A Pedro cross struck Chris Brunt's arm yet left referee Michael Oliver unmoved, and though Chelsea were dominant in possession, the hosts carried a threat on the break, which could have counted had James McClean's pass not forced Rondon to check his run. Hazard tumbled under Jonny Evans' attention, the appeals half-hearted, and Chelsea continued to be frustrated by a disciplined Baggies defence, Fabregas and Pedro firing wide from the edge of the box as Conte paced his area. David Luiz and Salomon Rondon battle for the ball during a goalless first half Chelsea resumed action with sharpened focus, Ben Foster brilliantly pushing away a Victor Moses drive and Claudio Yacob forced to clear on the line when Hazard jinked at the byline as the breakthrough remained elusive. Costa was taunted by the home fans as he slipped in the box while attempting to swivel and an Albion side growing in confidence so nearly punished Chelsea, Rondon breaking free only to be denied by a desperately backtracking Azpilicueta in the 71st minute. Conte had watched on with a grimace as Rondon raced away and Nacer Chadli had a glorious opportunity minutes later, only to fire wide. The Chelsea boss threw on Willian and Batshuayi for Pedro and Hazard as the half entered its final stages and a man seemingly surplus to requirements picked his moment, tucking beyond Foster as his team-mates exorcised demons of last term's underachievement with a fifth title of the Roman Abramovich reign.

The Chilean had toiled with his team-mates at St Mary's but he elevated a low-key Gunners display just before the hour mark, his quick feet and cool finish breaking the deadlock before substitute Olivier Giroud (82) sealed a win to keep Champions League qualification in sight. Defeat was tough on a Saints side that had crafted the better openings and forced Petr Cech into fine first-half saves from Manolo Gabbiadini and Nathan Redmond. Injury before the break to Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain was a sour note but Arsene Wenger's men, given renewed hope by victory against Manchester United at the weekend, ended a 14-year barren league run on the south coast at the most crucial of times to climb to fifth in the table. Alexis Sanchez skillfully made the breakthrough for Arsenal before Olivier Giroud sealed a crucial victory They still require their rivals to slip up if they are to qualify for the Champions League for a 20th successive season but have now closed in to within three points of Manchester City and four of Liverpool, with a game in hand on the Reds. Southampton had not mustered a shot on target during Sunday's goalless draw with Liverpool but here they threatened from kick-off, Redmond dangerous first with a cross and then a cut-back, which Steven Davis ballooned behind. Arsenal - with Shkodran Mustafi in for Laurent Koscielny - eased into the contest, waiting patiently for a break, but though Oxlade-Chamberlain gave his marker the slip with a drop of the shoulder, Aaron Ramsey's first-time swipe at the square ball flew wide. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain receives treatment before leaving the field injured A Cech save at Dusan Tadic's feet was a warning of Southampton's threat on the counter and despite Arsenal's growing authority, the hosts might have gone ahead on the half-hour, Gabbiadini denied as Cech spread himself superbly. Jack Stephens timed a tackle perfectly in the other box to thwart Mesut Ozil, the contest suddenly sparking, but Wenger suffered a setback shortly before the interval when Oxlade-Chamberlain limped off, Hector Bellerin sent on in his place. Nathan Redmond of Southampton closes down Rob Holding of Arsenal Redmond struck from range, forcing Cech to claw away (41), and Saints picked up where they left off at the restart, even if Davis miscued again when Gabbiadini rolled into his path. Sanchez, struggling to make an impact, grimaced as he was pulled up for a foul throw and Wenger looked on nervously as his side struggled for inspiration. But the breakthrough came in style in the 59th minute, Arsenal's talisman pivoting as he collected an Ozil ball to feet then cutting back inside to fox two defenders before slotting low for his 20th goal of the season. Olivier Giroud came off the bench to head Arsenal's second at St Mary's A Xhaka long-ranger made Forster work as Arsenal finally upped the tempo, though James Ward-Prowse might have done better at the other end with a decent Ryan Bertrand delivery. Sofiane Boufal took his cue from Sanchez as he twisted between yellow shirts, only to fire well over the bar, but Giroud - sent on with 10 minutes left - made a swift impact to settle nerves, heading Ramsey's nodded assist beyond Forster to keep hopes of a familiar season finish alive.

Two first-half goals by Diego Costa and Marcos Alonso sent the Blues on their way and Nemanja Matic scored at Stamford Bridge for the first time to wrap up the win in the second half. The league leaders, who are seven points clear of Tottenham with three games to play, can clinch the title with victory at West Brom on Friday Night Football. Boro barely threatened and the defeat makes it a swift return to the Championship one year and one day since they earned promotion against Brighton. Spurs' defeat at West Ham last Friday eased the pressure on Antonio Conte's side and they took full advantage to move within touching distance of a second title in three years. They now need just three points from their remaining three matches, with the visit to The Hawthorns followed by home games against Watford and Sunderland. Football Writers' Player of the Year N'Golo Kante missed out with a muscle injury, handing Cesc Fabregas the opportunity to start. The Spaniard was at the centre of Chelsea's commanding first-half display, creating their first chance inside 120 seconds. His fine pass picked out Alonso but the wing-back saw his left-foot volley hit the crossbar. Cesc Fabregas provided two assists against Middlesbrough The near miss only delayed the inevitable as Fabregas dragged an effort wide and Alonso went close again before Costa opened the scoring for the seventh time this season, more than any other player. The striker collected Fabregas' pass from the right and tucked home under Brad Guzan. Middlesbrough continued to struggle with Chelsea's cross-field passes and Alonso profited to force a second 11 minutes before half-time. The wing-back drilled a low strike across Guzan and the hapless Boro 'keeper diverted the ball into his own net. The half-time interval did little to halt Chelsea's charge as Pedro rattled the bar and Costa almost turned in his second at the far post. Diego Costa opened the scoring for the seventh Premier League game this season They grabbed their third through Matic on 65 minutes with Fabregas once again pulling the strings. His flicked pass found the Serbian in space and Matic controlled on his chest before firing through Guzan's legs. The assist makes Fabregas the first player in Premier League history to record at least 10 in six different seasons. A miserable evening for Boro threatened to get worse as Chelsea pushed to add further punishment but the last big cheer of the evening was reserved for John Terry. The club captain was introduced for David Luiz with six minutes remaining, capping a straightforward night for Conte's side.

surrendered ground in the race for Champions League qualification with a goalless draw against Southampton. Jurgen Klopp's laboured side had looked set for a nerve-settling breakthrough when Jack Stephens handled in the box in the second half but Milner - who had scored all previous 12 attempts from the spot for his club - was this time denied by Fraser Forster (66). Philippe Coutinho and substitute Daniel Sturridge had late chances against a Saints side that sat deep for long spells but though stalemate was a missed opportunity to consolidate a top-four spot, Arsenal's win over Manchester United at least puts Liverpool's fate back in their own hands. The Merseysiders climb a point above Manchester City into third but they have played a game more than both Manchester sides and the Gunners - seven further back with two fixtures in hand - remain in a race that continues to intrigue. James Milner (left) is held by Southampton's Serbian midfielder Dusan Tadic Klopp, whose team have now failed to beat Southampton on four occasions this season and taken just two points from a possible nine at Anfield, had called for a special atmosphere, but though his side bossed possession in the Merseyside sunshine, a packed Saints midfield kept early openings to a premium. Oriol Romeu's dithering was almost punished by Roberto Firmino 15 minutes in, Maya Yoshida blocking smartly, and Forster comfortably claimed the handful of high balls that came his way. The visitors continued to soak up pressure as keep-ball came to nothing and Coutinho - in the starting XI after shrugging off a dead leg - dropped deeper in search of action. Roberto Firmino (left) failed to unlock the Saints Klopp caught the eye on the sidelines, hurling a water bottle to the turf in anger after Lucas Leiva was penalised for a tussle with Dusan Tadic, but the action on the pitch drew groans as Firmino lashed wide from range and Joel Matip punted forward to epitomise the dearth of ideas. Southampton had not had a first-half shot on target but despite the Kop's roar as competition was renewed, the game's pattern failed to change and it was Claude Puel who made the first substitution, Nathan Redmond on for Sofiane Boufal. Milner at left-back had looked the best outlet and he finally had a chance in familiar territory when Stephens raised an arm in the box after grappling with Lucas. Jurgen Klopp says his side will keep pushing in the fight for a top four finish in the Premier League. His side were held to a draw by Southampton. Jurgen Klopp says his side will keep pushing in the fight for a top four finish in the Premier League. His side were held to a draw by Southampton. After a stale hour, the stage was set but the man who has kept his nerve from 12 yards seven times out of seven this season watched Forster drop to his right and push the ball away. Klopp threw on Sturridge and Adam Lallana in a bid to maintain momentum, the former showing quick feet to craft a yard but prodding straight at the goalkeeper. Simon Mignolet was lucky to escape punishment after appearing to handle just outside his area under pressure from Tadic, but though Forster came to Southampton's rescue when he tipped over a close-range header from Marko Grujic, time ticked away and the travelling Saints fans sang gleefully about another shut-out. Claude Puel said it was a fantastic defensive display from his side as they held Liverpool to a goalless draw at Anfield in the Premier League.

United made eight changes from their Europa League semi-final first leg against Celta Vigo on Thursday, and they fell behind shortly after half-time as Granit Xhaka's long-range shot deflected over David de Gea and into the net. Danny Welbeck doubled the lead three minutes later and Arsenal comfortably held on to give Arsene Wenger his first competitive win over Jose Mourinho. The victory also keeps Arsenal in the hunt for a top-four finish, although they still need either Liverpool or Manchester City to drop points. Henrikh Mkhitaryan is challenged by Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain The Gunners are seven points behind Liverpool with two games in hand, while defeat is United's first in the league since October 23, and leaves them four points outside the top four with three games left to play. United did have their top-four fate in their own hands after Liverpool's draw with Southampton earlier in the day, but Mourinho, perhaps with one eye on the Europa League return leg with Celta Vigo on Thursday, opted to rotate his starting line-up at the Emirates. Axel Tuanzebe was handed a first Premier League start while Phil Jones and Chris Smalling returned in defence and Eric Bailly, Paul Pogba and Marcus Rashford dropped to the bench.

Wayne Rooney captained United and he flicked an early cross over the bar before sliding through Anthony Martial, who shot at Petr Cech. De Gea then made a good save on the stretch at the other end to deny Aaron Ramsey after a through ball from Alexis Sanchez. Granit Xhaka celebrates scoring his sides first goal Although Arsenal largely looked the more threatening side, they took until the half-hour mark to create further chances. Welbeck saw a couple of close-range shots blocked before Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's deflected effort was pushed away by De Gea. But just as it seemed as though Arsenal were starting to raise the tempo, Holding almost gifted United the opener with a pass across his own goal that was picked up by Rooney, whose shot was saved by Cech. United continued to frustrate the hosts after half-time, but they were undone in the 54th minute when Xhaka's 30-yard attempt deflected off Ander Herrera's back and looped over De Gea. Danny Welbeck celebrates scoring Arsenal's second goal Welbeck made it 2-0 three minutes later, heading in off the bar from Oxlade-Chamberlain's cross. Rooney went closest to a response for United as he saw a free-kick saved and then fired over the bar from the edge of the box, but otherwise it was comfortable for Arsenal as they recorded a much-needed win.

"report": "2:54 Watch highlights from Man City's win over Crystal Palace Watch highlights from Man City's win over Crystal Palace David Silva shone as Manchester City moved up to third in the Premier League after beating Crystal Palace 5-0 at the Etihad on Saturday. Pep Guardiola's side led 1-0 at half-time thanks to Silva's strike just one minute and 54 seconds into his return from injury - the Spain international's 50th goal for the club. However, despite dominating the first half, City did not increase their lead until early in the second period when Vincent Kompany converted a low cross with a thunderous strike. The game was over as a contest minutes later when the hosts scored again thanks to Kevin De Bruyne's low shot from the edge of the area, before late strikes from Raheem Sterling and Nicolas Otamendi completed the scoring. As a result, City leapfrog Liverpool in the race to qualify for next season's Champions League, while 16th-placed Palace still need one more win to be all but mathematically safe from the drop. Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola was delighted by the performance Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola was delighted by the performance With Mamadou Sakho, James Tomkins and Scott Dann all unavailable with injury, Palace manager Sam Allardyce opted to play Jeffrey Schlupp as a makeshift central defender. However, it was Schlupp's partner at the back, Martin Kelly, who was at fault for City's opener, the defender heading Sterling's cross from the left-hand byline straight to the unmarked Silva, who finished unerringly from eight-yards out. Kevin De Bruyne (left) is congratulated after giving Man City a 3-0 lead The move began with a beautifully weighted ball over the top from Silva - back after two games out with a hamstring injury - to pick out Sterling, who had somehow managed to ghost in on Andros Townsend's blindside. That second-minute strike was just the lift in confidence City needed after struggling for form in recent weeks, with the twinkle-toed duo of Silva and Leroy Sane running the show before the break. Crystal Palace manager Sam Allardyce was left frustrated by his side's defensive display Crystal Palace manager Sam Allardyce was left frustrated by his side's defensive display But despite the increasingly busy Wayne Hennessey twice being called upon at his near post to keep out well-struck shots from Sane, it was actually the visitors who came closest to scoring next. And they would have done were it not for a brilliant reaction save by Willy Caballero, continuing to deputise for Claudio Bravo after the goalkeeper was ruled out for the season, to keep out Christian Benteke's close-range header 10 minutes before half-time following good wing play down the right by Townsend. Guardiola will no doubt have been disappointed that his side were only one goal ahead at the interval, although not for long as City made an electric start to the second half, Kompany finding the net at the Etihad for the first time in nearly two years with a clinical strike just four minutes after the break. Raheem Sterling celebrates after scoring Man City's fourth After Palace had cleared a left-wing corner, De Bruyne picked up possession before the Belgian spotted his compatriot in space some 14-yards out, although the City captain still had much to do as he thundered an unstoppable volley into the top right-hand corner of the net. With the breathing space of a two-goal cushion, City were now rampant, with De Bruyne hitting the top of the bar with a free-kick, before Hennessey was again needed to beat clear a low drive from Sane. Those near misses mattered little, however, as City soon added a third on the hour-mark, although on this occasion there were questions over Hennessey's positioning for the goal. Gabriel Jesus, starting up front in place of the injured Sergio Aguero, found De Bruyne some 25 yards from goal and from a tight angle towards the right edge of the box, the forward beat the Palace 'keeper with a low shot that the Wales international got a hand to, but could not keep out. Sterling then added a fourth eight minutes from time following a well-worked goal. Yaya Toure's inch-perfect cross-field pass found Pablo Zabaleta in space on the right of the area, with the substitute's clever knock-down being drilled into the back of the net by Sterling as the England international again reached double figures for the season. And the scoring was rounded off when Otamendi glanced in De Bruyne's stoppage-time free kick.

Highlights of Bournemouth's 2-2 draw with Stoke on Saturday Stoke scored their first away goals in 10 hours of football but could still only draw 2-2 at Bournemouth on Saturday. The Potters needed Lys Mousset, making his full Premier League debut for Bournemouth, to end their drought with a first-half own goal (33) before Junior Stanislas levelled shortly after the break (62). Mame Biram Diouf scored his first goal in 11 months to put Stoke back in front with just 17 minutes remaining, but another own goal - this time from Ryan Shawcross - ensured Mark Hughes' side continued their run of six away games without a win. Bournemouth's Lys Mousset made his first Premier League start The controversial late equaliser - Josh King had looked offside in the build-up - guarantees Bournemouth their Premier League status for another season while Stoke - all but safe - remain in 13th and are not yet mathematically sure of avoiding the drop. Mousset was making his first Premier League start after coming in for the injured Benik Afobe, while Stoke's Saido Berahino was dropped to the bench for Diouf after battling sickness this week. After a tentative opening, Adam Smith shook the game into life when he rattled the post with a left-footed drive on 22 minutes after a galloping run from right-back. Adam Smith and Joe Allen tussle with each other at the Vitality Stadium Moments later Harry Arter's risky challenge left its mark on Joe Allen, as the Bournemouth midfielder escaped with only a yellow card much to the Stoke players' protests. Stoke eventually broke their away duck when Marko Arnautovic's corner was nodded into the top corner just after the half-hour mark, with Geoff Cameron claiming the plaudits before Mousset was revealed to be the guilty party. Arnautovic was left ruing a missed header following good work by Allen to pick him out at the back post, with the Austrian unable to arrow his effort below the crossbar to double Stoke's lead in the 60th minute. Less than two minutes later, another marauding run from right-back saw Smith cross low into the area and find Stanislas - following Josh King's dummy - who prodded home to level the score. Diouf put Stoke City 2-1 up at the Vitality Stadium With 17 minutes remaining and substitute Jonathan Walters being readied on the bench, Diouf finally scuffed the ball into the net after Simon Francis failed to clear under pressure from Arnautovic. However, Stoke could not hold on for the win, with Shawcross unknowingly directing the ball into the corner of the net in the 81st minute after King - who looked offside - miscued his close-range effort.

Premier League safety after moving onto 40 points with a 2-2 draw against West Brom at Turf Moor. Sam Vokes tapped home from close range to fire Burnley ahead in the 56th minute, but Salomon Rondon (66) ended his drought to level for West Brom in what was their first league goal in almost nine hours. Birthday boy Craig Dawson then put West Brom ahead with a header from inside the six-yard area (78), but Vokes was on hand to head in his second four minutes from time to earn a point for the hosts. The result leaves Burnley six points above the drop zone, with their safety all but confirmed despite Swansea's win over Everton due to a far superior goal difference. West Brom end their of run of four straight defeats, but must go back to a 3-1 win over Arsenal in March for their last victory in the league. Burnley began the match without defender Michael Keane, whose ever-present run in the league this season came to an end after picking up a knock in training, while Tony Pulis made four changes to the side that lost 1-0 to Leicester, opting to field youngster Sam Field and hand a debut to Marc Wilson. Sam Vokes celebrates Burnley's opening goal The hosts enjoyed plenty of possession in the first half, but only really tested West Brom goalkeeper Ben Foster on one occasion. That chance fell for Vokes after 21 minutes, but his cut across goal following George Boyd's looped cross was kept out by the left foot of Foster. Rondon, who was looking to end a goal drought dating back to mid-December, had a couple of decent chances for the visitors but twice saw efforts deflect wide off Kevin Long. James McClean and Jeff Hendrick compete for the ball at Turf Moor Scott Arfield seemed destined to find the net in the 35th minute, but a sensational last-ditch sliding tackle from James McClean blocked his effort. It was Vokes who gave Burnley the lead 11 minutes after the break, with the forward turning home Ashley Barnes' cross. West Brom responded well, however, and scored their first goal in eight hours and 51 minutes when Rondon's strike on the turn nestled into the far corner - his first goal since a hat-trick against Swansea on December 14. The visitors then went ahead through Dawson, who almost had the honour of being the match-winner on his 27th birthday before Vokes' late intervention. Vokes has now scored three goals in his last three games A long ball into the box from Robbie Brady was met by Vokes, whose header looped over Foster and bounced into the empty net to level the scores. There was a late chance for James McClean to steal if for the Baggies, but he failed to get enough power on his attempted lob over Burnley 'keeper Tom Heaton.

Jones' diving header in the 69th minute gave David Moyes' Sunderland the victory, though Hull had several clear chances to score in both halves. Defoe added a second in stoppage time from Seb Larsson's cross, bundling the ball over the line from close range, but replays showed the England striker was offside. Jordan Pickford made several fine saves from Sam Clucas and Abel Hernandez to keep the hosts at bay, and the result means Hull are now in the relegation zone, a point off 17th-place Swansea with three games remaining following their 1-0 win over Everton. The defeat was also Hull manager Marco Silva's first at home in the league since March 2014, 42 games ago. With the shackles off, relegated Sunderland played with more freedom in the first half, and went close earlier on as George Honeyman headed just wide from Jones' cross. Hull then had two chances in quick succession; first Clucas' half volley from 15 yards was beaten away well by Pickford, before Harry Maguire's 20-yard effort flew just wide of the left-hand post. Hernandez, who had returned to the starting XI for Marco Silva's men, then did superbly to weave past two Sunderland defenders on the right of the box, but his left-footed effort went just wide of the far post. Jason Denayer and Alfred N'Diaye battle for the ball Defoe almost put Sunderland ahead early in the second half, but his effort when one-on-one with Eldin Jakupovic was saved by the Hull stopper, while Alfred N'Diaye made a hash of a clear chance at the other end with Pickford stranded. Lazar Markovic saw a header tipped over the bar by Pickford before the hour mark, and John O'Shea then did brilliantly to block Hernandez's effort from 10 yards. Sunderland took the lead with 21 minutes remaining through Jones, who drifted into the six-yard box unmarked from Honeyman's corner to head past Jakupovic. Oumar Niasse poked an effort wide of the right-hand post with 15 minutes to go, before Pickford's heroics denied Hull again, this time beating away Hernandez's first-time effort from N'Diaye's centre. Hull pushed forward, but it was Sunderland who got the next goal, as Defoe finished off his thigh from close range (90+2) from substitute Larsson's delivery, though he was half a yard ahead of Maguire when the ball was delivered.

Wilfred Ndidi gave the hosts the lead in the 38th minute before Riyad Mahrez scored on his 100th Premier League appearance early in the second half. Marc Albrighton capped off the win when he finished off a swift counter in injury-time. The victory sees the Foxes move up to ninth and Shakespeare becomes the fourth manager to win his first five Premier League home games after Manuel Pellegrini, Sven Goran Eriksson and Carlo Ancelotti. While Shakespeare's future beyond the end of the season is unclear, this was yet another impressive win to add to his resume, having taken over in February with the Foxes fighting relegation. Watford, meanwhile, have now lost three in a row and finish the season with trips to Everton and Chelsea before hosting Manchester City. Leicester were unchanged from their win over West Brom, but top scorer Troy Deeney dropped to the bench for Watford in place of Stefano Okaka. There was little between the sides in the early stages, with Tom Cleverley curling a first-time shot wide from the edge of the box and Adrian Mariappa then turning a cross onto his own post at the other end. Heurelho Gomes made a sharp save to turn away a header from defender Christian Kabasele, but the visitors improved as the half wore on and Kasper Schmeichel had to save from Okaka and Cleverley. It was against the run of play when Leicester opened the scoring, with a cross falling for Ndidi to fire in from close range. Mahrez struck the top of the bar shortly afterwards, and the Algerian doubled the lead shortly before the hour-mark (58), finishing from a tight angle after Mariappa failed to clear. Jamie Vardy shot at Gomes and substitute Islam Slimani blazed over the bar as the Foxes pressed for more goals. Watford's only opportunities came from distance, with Schmeichel saving from M'Baye Niang and Cleverley, and it was the hosts who had the final say as Albrighton finished to beat Gomes at his near post in injury-time (90+3).

The Welsh side needed three points to leapfrog Hull City into 17th place after the Tigers lost 2-0 to already-relegated Sunderland earlier in the day. And that is exactly what happened during a nervy encounter at the Liberty Stadium as Llorente nodded home from a Jordan Ayew cross in the 29th minute to seal a vital win for the Swans. They now have 35 points - one more than Hull - while Everton missed the chance to go into the top six above Arsenal and remain in seventh spot. Swansea made one change from the side that drew with Man Utd last weekend as Martin Olsson replaced Stephen Kingsley at left-back, while Ronald Koeman made two alterations from the 3-0 loss to Chelsea, although neither could muster much in the way of chances during the first 25 minutes. The home side had a penalty shout in the 28th minute, with Gylfi Sigurdsson going to ground just inside the box after an apparent foul from Gareth Barry but referee Martin Atkinson waved away the claims. The Iceland international thumped the pitch in fury, but he was not left angry for long as Llorente netted a few seconds later. Fernando Llorente opens the scoring for Swansea City Ayew put in some fantastic work down the right-hand side, digging the ball out under pressure from Barry to fire a cross into the box that met the head of the Spanish striker at the back post, rising above marker Phil Jagielka to score his 13th goal of the season and crucially put Swansea ahead. It spurred on the hosts and they could have nabbed a quick second in the 33rd minute as Sigurdsson's cross from the right flank fell to the feet of Alfie Mawson at the back post. He found himself with plenty of space to shoot, but a great interception from Mason Holgate saw him turn the ball wide. 1956 – Everton have lost their first league game in Wales since a 0-1 defeat at Cardiff in December 1956. Unstuck. — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) May 6, 2017 Koeman made a change at the break as Ross Barkely replaced Dominic Calvert-Lewin and he had an almost instant impact as Everton started the half strongly. He pumped a free-kick into the box, but Jagielka could not direct his header on target before Llorente cleared a rebounded cross into the box from Barry. Ten minutes into the second period and Swansea could have doubled their lead. A poor headed clearance from Jagielka saw the ball fall to the feet of Ayew and he took aim, but his effort smashed against the woodwork and went wide. Despite an improved display from Everton, who were seeing plenty of the ball, it was Swansea that continued to have the better chances. Sigurdsson delivered successive corners just before the 70-minute mark, with the first meeting the head of Federico Fernandez but ricocheting off the shoulder of Barkley before another Llorente header was well collected by Maarten Stekelenburg. Alfie Mawson and Dominic Calvert-Lewin contest a header at the Liberty Stadium The hosts went close again in the 78th minute as they looked to secure their victory, producing a fine counter-attack that saw Tom Carroll skip away down the left-hand side before firing a cross into the box for the incoming Leroy Fer, but he was denied by the foot of Stekelenburg who pushed his effort onto the post and ultimately wide. Everton were camped in the Swansea half in the final 10 minutes as the game drew to a nervous conclusion for the home fans. Barkley whipped a free-kick into the box with three minutes of normal time to play, which was flicked on by Kevin Mirallas at the near post for the head of Ashley Williams but it just evaded the former Swans defender before going wide. Ultimately, they were unable to find their way past a determined Swansea side as the fans roared them home in added time, with scenes of celebration as the full-time whistle was blown.

Lanzini's fired home from close range with 25 minutes remaining following some pinball in the Spurs area as they failed to clear Aaron Cresswell's cross. The result means Chelsea can win the Premier League by winning their next two games, at home to Middlesbrough on Monday Night Football and at West Brom next Friday, before Spurs next play at home to Manchester United on Nissan Super Sunday. Lanzini finishes up from close range after pinball in the penalty area. West Ham had goalkeeper Adrian to thank for keeping Spurs at bay throughout the game, producing superb saves from Harry Kane and Heung-Min Son in both halves, as the hosts held on for a vital win over their London rivals. West Ham now have 42 points, and are mathematically safe from relegation. After a gritty opening 20 minutes, the first big chance fell to Spurs and Kane, who was denied twice by Adrian. Harry Kane sees an effort saved by Adrian in the first half First, his 20-yard effort was fumbled by the Hammers stopper, before Dele Alli's rebound was blocked and Kane's second effort was superbly turned over the bar by Adrian's foot. From the resulting corner, Adrian then tipped away Eric Dier's header with a smart save as Spurs came to life. But West Ham had chances of their own and went close when Lanzini was played through by Mark Noble, only for Hugo Lloris to rush out and just about get enough on the ball outside the box to avoid a foul and red card. West Ham United's Andre Ayew and Tottenham Hotspur's Dele Alli battle for the ball With Lloris grounded, Cheikhou Kouyate tried to lob the ball into the net, but could not hit the target from the edge of the box. Christian Eriksen wasted a good chance on the hour mark, poking straight at Adrian after a fine Tottenham move involving Son and Kyle Walker, before Adrian tipped wide Son's effort from 20 yards towards the bottom corner. But it was the hosts who took the lead on 65 minutes through Lanzini, who lashed home low from five yards out after Sam Byram and Andre Ayew had kept the ball alive in the box from a Cresswell cross. Eric Dier and Jonathan Calleri compete for the ball Tottenham threatened to fall apart after falling behind, as Toby Alderweireld's mistake in defence allowed Jonathan Calleri a clear sight at goal, but his effort was saved brilliantly by Lloris. Eriksen shot just wide from range late on, before Ashley Fletcher missed a late one-on-one on the counter attack, but it ended 1-0 to West Ham, a Premier League-high seventh win by that scoreline this season.

driving seat for a top-four finish with a 1-0 victory at Watford. The Germany international's audacious stoppage-time overhead kick brought a subdued first half at Vicarage Road to a spectacular end, laying the foundation for a crucial win for Jurgen Klopp's men. As Liverpool failed to double their lead in the second period Watford improved, but there was no way back for Walter Mazzarri's men, who saw Sebastian Prodl thunder a volley against the bar in injury time. With just three games remaining, the victory sees Liverpool strengthen their grip on third place ahead of the Manchester clubs, who they lead by three and four points respectively. Watford, whose end-of-season stagnation continues, remain in 13th place on 40 points. Unchanged from last week's defeat to Crystal Palace, Liverpool were boosted by the return of Adam Lallana to the bench after recovering from a groin injury to end a four-and-a-half-week lay-off Midfielder Philippe Coutinho was injured early on for Liverpool Adrian Mariappa was drafted into the Watford line-up in place of Jose Holebas and his fifth-minute challenge on Philippe Coutinho led to Lallana's earlier than expected introduction, with the England international replacing the Brazil midfielder in the 13th minute after he failed to run off a suspected dead leg. The substitution of injured Watford defender Miguel Britos then punctuated the game further as both teams struggled to settle in the opening 20 minutes. It took until four minutes before the interval for the game's first attempt on goal as Lallana's looping volley from the edge of the area cannoned off the underside of the Watford bar. Lucas Leiva was then booked for simulation after trying to win a penalty from a Tom Cleverley challenge, but referee Craig Pawson was unmoved. The Brazilian quickly atoned for his mishap though, floating a delightful ball forward for Can who produced an exquisite, acrobatic finish that flew past Heurelho Gomes. 3 - Lucas Leiva has provided 3 assists in his last 5 Premier League games, as many as in his previous 163 top-flight apps. Renaissance. pic.twitter.com/Xq2BaaaS6C — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) May 1, 2017 A goal of the highest quality understandably boosted Liverpool in the second period, with only the reactions of Gomes, denying Divock Origi twice, preventing the visitors from doubling their lead. But, while the Merseysiders were pursuing a second, Watford grew in confidence, Etienne Capoue's fierce 20-yard drive drawing a fingertip save from Simon Mignolet on 70 minutes. Emre Can scores for Liverpool against Watford Liverpool had the chance to wrap up the victory six minutes later but, after holding his run to latch onto Can's through pass, Lallana's shot was deflected behind. Daniel Sturridge was introduced moments before Daryl Janmaat tried to catch a misplaced Mignolet out with a near-post shot seven minutes from time, but the Belgian recovered just in time to avoid embarrassment. Sturridge was thwarted by a fine late save from Gomes as Watford kept their hopes of getting something from the game alive. And Liverpool were so nearly made to pay for their profligacy as Prodl smashed a volley against the frame of the goal deep into injury time - but it wasn't to be as the Reds sealed a third consecutive away victory. 3 - Liverpool have won 3 consecutive Premier League away games under Jurgen Klopp for only the second time (also in October 2016).

Wayne Rooney's penalty on the stroke of half-time, controversially awarded after Marcus Rashford went down under a challenge from Lukasz Fabianski, appeared to have United on course for victory before Sigurdsson curled in 11 minutes from time. The point was well deserved and could prove precious for Swansea, who remain in the relegation zone, two points behind Hull with three games remaining to preserve their Premier League status. Meanwhile, Manchester United extended their unbeaten Premier League run to 25 matches, but missed the chance to move into third ahead of Manchester City's game with Middlesbrough and Liverpool's trip to Watford on Monday Night Football. And Jose Mourinho's frustration will be even greater after injuries to defenders Luke Shaw and Eric Bailly ahead of Thursday's Europa League semi-final against Celta Vigo. Shaw limped off as early as the ninth minute, replaced by Antonio Valencia, in a first half which saw Swansea dominate both possession and chances. Luke Shaw limped off in the early stages of the game Bailly's weak clearance almost deflected in off Sigurdsson, but ricocheted just wide, and Fernando Llorente forced a smart save from David de Gea with Daley Blind forced to head the rebound away. Sigurdsson was inches away from tapping into an empty net after De Gea used his feet to keep out Jordan Ayew's low shot, but Swansea failed to make their superiority count and they were punished by a harsh penalty in first-half injury time. Rashford latched onto Jesse Lingard's through ball and nicked the ball past Fabianski as he dived at his feet, but the United player appeared to engineer contact and went down easily. Referee Neil Swarbrick delayed before pointing to the spot amid furious protests from the Swansea players and Rooney sent the goalkeeper the wrong way with almost the final kick of the half. The United skipper nearly added a second, but his goalbound shot was blocked by team-mate Anthony Martial, before Bailly was injured tackling Llorente and was replaced by Matteo Darmian after an hour. Wayne Rooney is congratulated by his Manchester United team-mates after scoring a penalty against Swansea Fabianski reacted brilliantly to stop Martial's deflected shot with his feet and later pushed away Valencia's rasping drive, to keep Swansea - who saw Jefferson Montero stretchered off six minutes after coming on as a 65th-minute substitute - in the game. And they were rewarded by Sigurdsson's sumptuous free-kick in the 79th minute, awarded after Rooney fouled Ayew on the edge of the area. Ander Herrera stood on the goal-line by the post, before leaving that position to join the wall, and the Swansea midfielder punished him by curling the set piece to where the Manchester United midfielder had been standing to level up the game. Gylfi Sigurdsson of Swansea celebrates scoring his side's equaliser with Martin Olsson It should have been even better for Swansea when Sigurdsson curled a free-kick into the area in injury-time, but Llorente could not connect with the goal at his mercy. However, Swansea boss Paul Clement will surely be satisfied with a point ahead of games against Everton (h), Sunderland (a) and West Brom (h) as their survival scrap looks set to go down to the wire. A disappointed Mourinho will now focus his attention on Thursday night's Europa League semi-final before United continue their top-four push at Arsenal next week on Super Sunday.

Pedro's long-range strike, followed by Cahill's bundled effort and a simple tap-in for substitute Willian made sure Chelsea went seven points clear of title rivals Spurs before their Super Sunday clash with Arsenal. Meanwhile, the defeat for Everton means they remain seventh in their first home loss this calendar year. The match got off to a fast start as Dominic Calvert-Lewin's driven ball into the area almost rebounded off the post for Lukaku to tap in from six-yards out, only for the Premier League's top goalscorer to unfortunately slip before pulling the trigger. Chelsea fired a warning shot of their own moments later through an unlikely source in Cahill, who smashed a shot from 25-yards out which Maarten Stekelenburg was just about able to smother. Eden Hazard sprung into life in the 11th minute as he picked up a fine through ball from Diego Costa to burst through on goal, but despite skipping around Stekelenburg, the angle was too tight for the Belgium international to apply the finish. Romelu Lukaku slipped before taking a shot on goal early on in the first half After Nemanja Matic's marauding run was ended by Stekelenburg covering his shot, Lukaku threatened with an effort from distance at the other end which skidded just wide of the post. Costa then blasted a shot over the bar from close-range after being set through by a David Luiz long ball. The half became increasingly scrappy as referee Jonathan Moss gave yellow cards out to Cahill, Calvert-Lewin and Cesar Azpilicueta to see out a tightly-contested 45 minutes. Chelsea came close to breaking the deadlock early in the second half after a corner routine saw Victor Moses thump a low cross across the face of the goal, but the driven ball was too fast for Costa to tap in. Everton responded first through Enner Valencia, whose effort was blocked by Thibaut Courtois before Lukaku had a tame shot straight at the goalkeeper from 18-yards out. Chelsea's Pedro opens the scoring at Goodison Park Despite Everton increasing appetite for adventure going forward, Chelsea's Pedro opened the scoring with a fine strike. From 25-yards out, he moved the ball onto his left foot and thumped a strike into the top corner to score his eighth league goal of the season. Lukaku nearly levelled with a free-kick from just outside the box, but his curled strike was just over the bar. But the Toffees would pay the price for their lack of end product as Chelsea doubled their lead through Cahill, who bundled the ball into the net following a driven free-kick into the box by Hazard. Chelsea introduced Cesc Fabregas and Willian off the bench, and they combined to give their sid a three-goal lead. The onrushing Fabregas picked up a threaded Costa pass before squaring to Willian to finish and ultimately give Chelsea a comfortable victory.

"report": "2:44 Middlesbrough 2-2 Man City Middlesbrough 2-2 Man City Manchester City twice came from behind to dent Middlesbrough's Premier League survival hopes with an absorbing 2-2 draw at the Riverside on Sunday. Former City striker Alvaro Negredo put Boro ahead in the 38th minute, only for Sergio Aguero to reply from the penalty spot after half-time. Boro were fuming at the award of the spot-kick for a foul on Leroy Sane, but they were ahead again in the 77th minute when Calum Chambers finished from close range. They failed to see out the win, however, as Gabriel Jesus snatched a point for City when he headed in with five minutes remaining. Sergio Aguero scored City's first goal from the penalty spot While a point apiece was probably a fair result on the balance of play, it appears more valuable for City than Boro, who are now six points from safety with three games left to play. City stay fourth, but miss the chance to capitalise on Manchester United's earlier draw against Swansea. Pep Guardiola made five changes from the stalemate with United on Thursday, with Aleix Garcia making his first Premier League start, Willy Caballero replacing the injured Claudio Bravo in goal and Jesus starting for the first time since February 13. An open start to the game saw Aguero and Negredo both fire across the face of goal in the early stages. But City's threat waned as the half wore on and Marten de Roon went close for the hosts when he shot over from 10 yards out. Alvaro Negredo (left) celebrates scoring the opening goal for Middlesbrough against Manchester City Jesus headed wide from a good position shortly afterwards, but Boro took the lead in the 38th minute as Negredo finished from the edge of the box after a swift break. City needed a spark and they improved significantly after the introduction of Sane and Raheem Sterling early in the second half. The equaliser, though, came in controversial circumstances as Sane appeared to be already falling as he went down in the box under a challenge from De Roon. Boro players were clearly angered by the decision to award the penalty, but Aguero kept his cool from the spot as he fired into the corner. City were not level for long as Negredo did well to keep the ball alive in the box and then pass through for Chambers to finish from six yards out. However, Jesus snatched a point for City when he headed in from Aguero's cross with five minutes remaining.

Dele Alli scored his 17th league goal of the season to break the deadlock on 55 minutes and Harry Kane picked himself up to score from the penalty spot three minutes later. The three-minute second-half spell settled the match, with Kane, who has scored in five consecutive league games against the Gunners, once again their nemesis. Chelsea's impressive 3-0 win at Everton earlier on Super Sunday put the pressure on Spurs, but they responded to ensure the gap to top spot remains four points. The victory also means they are guaranteed to finish above Arsenal in the Premier League for the first time since 1995. The result keeps Arsene Wenger's side sixth and they now face a real battle to secure Champions League qualification, having lost ground on top-four rivals Manchester City and Manchester United, who dropped points to Middlesbrough and Swansea respectively. Chelsea's thumping victory threatened to dampen enthusiasm at the Lane but Mauricio Pochettino's men maintained their focus and were the better side throughout. The Spurs boss preferred Kieran Trippier to Kyle Walker, while Moussa Dembele dropped to the bench having failed to shake off an ankle injury suffered against Crystal Palace. Harry Kane scores his 21st league goal of the season Wenger kept faith with his 3-4-3 formation, with starts for Aaron Ramsey, Olivier Giroud and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, but a sluggish opening spell by the visitors put Spurs on the front foot. Toby Alderweireld flashed an early header over before the home side squandered two glorious chances in quick succession. Watch Harry Kane and Jan Vertonghen deliver their post-match reaction to Sky Sports Watch Harry Kane and Jan Vertonghen deliver their post-match reaction to Sky Sports The first fell to Alli, who nodded wide from three yards under pressure from Oxlade-Chamberlain. That glaring miss was swiftly followed by another as Christian Eriksen blazed over an equally gilt-edged opportunity. Son's deflected strike fortuitously broke six yards out but the Denmark international guided his volley over Petr Cech's crossbar. The wasteful finishing seemed to give Arsenal a boost and they grew into the match as the interval approached. Arsene Wenger cut his interview short following Arsenal's 2-0 defeat but admitted Spurs deserved the victory overall Arsene Wenger cut his interview short following Arsenal's 2-0 defeat but admitted Spurs deserved the victory overall Aaron Ramsey called Hugo Lloris into action with a low strike before Alexis Sanchez guided a curling effort wide. But that revival proved to be short-lived as the Gunners conceded twice in three minutes after the break. Alli reacted quickest to open the scoring after super play by Eriksen and Arsenal barely had time to catch their breath before falling two behind. Referee Michael Oliver awarded a penalty for Gabriel's challenge on Kane Gabriel upended Kane in the box and the England striker took full advantage from the spot, netting his 21st league goal of the season. The hosts continued to push for a third as Jan Vertonghen, Kane and Alderweireld each forced smart saves from Cech. They also had a second penalty appeal waved away by referee Michael Oliver when Son's flick appeared to make contact with Sanchez's arm. Arsenal pushed back in the closing stages but they rarely troubled Lloris, with Theo Walcott drawing a routine stop from the Frenchman late on. With four matches remaining in the title race, Pochettino's side can close the gap to Chelsea to one point if they win at West Ham on Friday Night Football. Antonio Conte's league leaders then face Middlesbrough at Stamford Bridge on Monday Night Football. Arsenal have the perfect chance to bounce back at home to top-four contenders Manchester United next Sunday, live on Sky Sports.

in their relegation battle after a 0-0 draw with Southampton at St Mary's. With the game heading for a stalemate, Southampton were given the chance to earn a somewhat undeserved victory in stoppage time, but Dusan Tadic saw his penalty saved by Jakupovic. There was little other goalmouth action of note in the match, with Kamil Grosicki coming closest for the visitors early on as his free-kick hit the post. Hull City players celebrate with Eldin Jakupovic The result sees Hull pull three points clear of the bottom three, with Swansea in 18th playing on Sunday at Manchester United, and condemns Sunderland to Championship football next season. Saints stay ninth. An unchanged Hull were slightly the better side in a poor first half, and almost took the lead as early as the sixth minute. Grosicki curled a delightful free-kick over the wall towards the top corner, but the ball clipped the outside of the post and flew wide. The hosts really struggled to find any rhythm, and did not muster a single shot on or off target in the opening period. Jakupovic celebrates with fans after the match After the break, the action remained a little cagey. Harry Maguire was having a fine game for Hull, however, and made a crucial late block to deny Sofiane Boufal early in the second half. Tadic then went close with a volley, before all the entertainment came in the final 10 minutes. Firstly, Jakupovic made amends for a poor punch by racing out to block from Redmond, before Oumar Niasse blazed over from a good position down the other end. Andrea Ranocchia (right) pulls back Manolo Gabbiadini Then, just seconds into stoppage time, Alfred N'Diaye clumsily bundled Maya Yoshida to the floor, leaving referee Mike Dean no option other than to point to the spot. Tadic stepped up confidently, struck the penalty low to Jakupovic's left, but the Hull stopper superbly clawed the ball out and away from danger. Substitute Michael Dawson missed a late header that would have completed a most dramatic final flurry, but Saints held on for the draw.

The best chance of the game fell to the Hammers, with Andre Ayew forcing a fine save from Jack Butland with an acrobatic effort. Xherdan Shaqiri went close on two occasions in the second half, while Saido Berahino also saw a fine effort tipped wide by Adrian, but both sides eventually had to settle for a point. The result means Stoke reach the 40-point mark and stay 11th, while West Ham are a point behind in 14th, eight points clear of the drop zone. During a first half lacking in chances, Winston Reid pulled off a superb block to deny Berahino from close range, before the West Ham defender pulled off a similar tackle later in the half from Stoke's January signing. Andre Ayew has his overhead kick saved by Jack Butland Then came the chance for Ayew, whose brilliant overhead kick from Arthur Masuaku's left-wing cross was tipped away brilliantly by Butland, who impressed in front of England manager Gareth Southgate. West Ham almost took the lead on the stroke of half-time through Jonathan Calleri, who instead of wrapping his left foot around the ball from a rebound eight yards out, opted for a bizarre 'Rabona'-style effort, which was blocked. The game livened up in the second half with chances for both sides, the first falling to Cheikhou Kouyate, who struck just wide from 15 yards out on the right. Shaqiri then bundled an effort wide from six yards, before Berahino came close with a fierce effort from an acute angle, tipped wide brilliantly by Adrian. Marko Arnautovic battles with Edimilson Fernandes Butland then made two fine saves from Manuel Lanzini, first beating away a fierce effort from 20 yards, then saving with his feet from a close-range header. Stoke had the chance to win it with 14 minutes remaining as Shaqiri's fine ball found Marko Arnautovic, but the Austrian could not convert on the stretch as Adrian kept West Ham level again.

Josh King scored the winner in the 88th minute at the Stadium of Light to relegate the Black Cats, who needed to better Hull's result at Southampton to prolong their stay in the top flight for at least another week. But Hull held on for a 0-0 draw against Southampton, helped by a 90th-minute penalty save from Eldin Jakupovic, to seal Sunderland's fate. Jermain Defoe and Fabio Borini went closest for the hosts in an open game while King hit the bar for the Cherries in the 20th minute. The win means Bournemouth pass the 40-point mark and are now 10 points clear of the relegation zone, while Sunderland have been relegated from the Premier League on four occasions, having spent nearly all of the season in the bottom three. John O'Shea shows his disappointment They have only won five matches and the swathes of empty seats at the full-time whistle told their own story. But Sunderland did have their chances in a game that could have gone either way, with Defoe unusually wasteful for the hosts with eight shots and only one on target. Having made four changes, including handing Steven Pienaar a first appearance since February 11, the hosts made a nervy start in defence. A corner was turned just wide in the first minute before King almost headed in a cross from Fraser. Sunderland's Wahbi Khazri takes on Lewis Cook The Black Cats also threatened, with Borini's swerving shot parried away by Artur Boruc and Defoe firing over from a good position. King went close with a brilliantly executed chip over Jordan Pickford from the left side of the box that hit the underside of the bar. Sunderland's best chance fell to Defoe but he volleyed straight at Boruc from eight yards out after Didier N'Dong headed over the top of the defence. Jermain Defoe looks for a way past Harry Arter Defoe had another shot into the side-netting before King's effort on the turn was blocked by Donald Love. There were more chances at both ends at the start of the second half, with Marc Pugh curling a shot wide and Boruc making a good save to deny Borini. Boruc was again called upon to save from Sunderland substitute George Honeyman at the near post and then keep out a first-time effort from Borini. But as the Black Cats committed men forward in the closing stages they were caught on the break as Fraser passed across goal for King to tap in. A penalty to Southampton gave Sunderland brief hope of delaying their relegation, but Jakupovic's save sealed their fate.

The Foxes are now nine points clear of the drop zone and have reached the tally that is traditionally seen as safe from relegation, with the England striker sliding home in the 43rd minute to seal the three points. It was a fifth Premier League game in a row that the Baggies have failed to score in and their fourth consecutive defeat, although will feel aggrieved that they should have been awarded an 80th minute penalty. However, they had few real chances to speak of aside from a Chris Brunt header in the first half and remain in eighth on 44 points but winless in over a month, while Leicester move up into 11th. Tony Pulis made three changes from their last Premier League outing, leaving Darren Fletcher out of his starting XI for the first time since he moved to the club in February 2015, while Shinji Okazaki replaced Leonardo Ulloa up front for Leicester. The game was a physical battle throughout, with numerous fouls and free kicks littering the opening exchanges which kept referee Mark Clattenburg busy in his final ever Premier League game. Indeed, Danny Drinkwater was arguably lucky not to be sent off in the 16th minute as he produced a crunching tackle on Nacer Chadli, but only received a yellow card. Jamie Vardy netted his 17th goal of the season at The Hawthorns West Brom had the first chance of the half in the 18th minute as Chris Brunt tested Kasper Schmeichel, latching onto the end of a long Jonny Evans pass at the back post but his header was tipped over the crossbar by the Foxes captain. Neither side could truly muster anything better as the half wore on but it was Leicester that took the advantage with two minutes of normal time to play. Salomon Rondon played a pass into a pocket of space that allowed Okazaki to latch onto the ball, sliding it into the path of Vardy who expertly dispatched past Ben Foster to see the Foxes ahead. 3 - Jamie Vardy has scored in all three of his Premier League appearances away at West Bromwich Albion. Thorn. — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) April 29, 2017 The second period saw plenty more chances and Leicester could have had the win sown up after a few minutes of the restart. Vardy flashed a ball across the face of goal from the left-hand side but Okazaki just missed the chance to poke it home as it ran wide. West Brom were on the attack a minute later as Rondon had his first real sight of goal but his strike on the turn was well collected by Schmeichel. Gareth McAuley then headed on a Chadli corner but Evans could not meet it at the back post. Danny Drinkwater chases down James Morrison during the Premier League match Just after the hour mark and Riyad Mahrez showed flashes of brilliance that had been lacking for much of the game as Drinkwater powered through the middle of the park, before fining the Algerian on the right. He rounded Allan Nyom with ease before going for goal, but just clipped the outside of the post. But West Brom continued to press for the equaliser as the game drew to a conclusion. Schmeichel collected from a James Morrison header in the 78th minute before the hosts had a big shout for a penalty turned down two minutes later as Robert Huth nudged Rondon in the back, sending him to ground inside the area, but Clattenburg waved away the calls. Claudio Yacob and Jamie Vardy had a physical tussle during the first half Mahrez could have wrapped up the victory for Leicester with eight minutes of normal times to play as he danced into the box from the right flank before curling towards goal but his effort just evaded the top corner, much to his frustration. But Leicester managed to keep West Brom at bay for the remainder of the game to secure a vital three points and extended the Baggies barren run in front of goal.

In a performance of defensive steel and clinical finishing, goals from Ashley Barnes and substitute Andre Gray brushed aside a timid Palace outfit, who slipped back to their early season showings in front of the Selhurst Park faithful. The hosts looked vulnerable up against Burnley's direct style and seemed to miss the influence of Mamadou Sakho, who suffered a knee injury against Tottenham in midweek. Burnley, who were pre-season favourites to go down, are now sitting pretty on 39 points, eight points clear of Swansea while Palace remain on 38 points and still have a little bit of work to guarantee Premier League football next season. Ashley Barnes (left) celebrates scoring the opening goal with Scott Arfield Unlike recent victories over Chelsea, Arsenal and Liverpool, the onus was Palace to make the running and force the game against the Clarets, who were happy to play on the break with a direct approach. It worked a charm as the hosts looked lacking in ideas with the ball. In comparison, Burnley's gameplan of getting the ball up to Sam Vokes and Barnes caused chaos. It took just eight minutes for them to create an opening - and Barnes took it. Stephen Ward found space down the left and fired in a low cross which was missed by Martin Kelly and Barnes was on hand to fire home from six yards after having two bites at the cherry. Frustrations boiled over in the stands after the goal as Burnley's James Tarkowski while celebrating the goal was hit with a lighter seemingly thrown from the Palace end. Burnley celebrate in front of the travelling fans as they pulled clear of relegation Barnes had the ball in the net again eight minutes later, but this time the officials spared Palace's blushes. Burnley won two aerial challenges inside the Palace box and the ball dropped to Barnes from close range but despite scruffily knocking the ball home, his effort was ruled out for handball as he used his arm to control the dropping ball. Vokes was the next Burnley player to win a header in the Palace box under no pressure but his header from 15 yards sailed inches wide with Wayne Hennessey beaten. The goalkeeper then had to repel a Barnes header after another cross from the left evaded the Palace centre-backs. Burnley sat a little deeper in the second period as they soaked up spells of Palace pressure but Tarkowski and Michael Keane, especially, kept Christian Benteke very quiet. The Belgian was replaced on 71 minutes after failing to influence the game. Wilfried Zaha was Palace's only real dangerous outlet and he wanted a penalty with 11 minutes remaining when Jon Flanagan came through the back of him but referee Bobby Madley judged that the defender got a toe to the ball. Minutes later, Burnley doubled their advantage with a classy counter attack. Sloppy passing in midfield was seized upon by George Boyd and he hit a majestic pass in behind for Gray, who steadied himself and fired past Hennessey at his near post.

The 174th meeting between City and United, which offered little in terms of action, burst into life six minutes from time when Fellaini saw red following a heated altercation with Aguero. The late flashpoint came after a drab encounter in which Pep Guardiola and Jose Mourinho failed to strengthen their respective claims for Champions League qualification. Aguero came closest to deciding the game, striking the post early on and blazing a glorious chance over, after the returning Gabriel Jesus had a goal ruled out for offside in stoppage-time. But 10-man United clung on for a point that leaves them in fifth, a point and a place behind City with five games remaining. Mourinho sprung an early surprise at the Eastlands, with the returning Henrikh Mkhitaryan deployed up front with Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial out wide. Manchester's City Sergio Aguero is closed down by Michael Carrick It failed to have the desired effect though, as Aguero turned Kevin De Bruyne's sumptuous cross against the post in the ninth minute, as City ensured both teams got off to an even start. Despite going on to dominate the opening quarter, City nearly handed United the initiative when Claudio Bravo needlessly flapped at a Martial cross, but the Chilean goalkeeper avoided another embarrassing moment in an error-strewn season by saving Mkhitaryan's follow-up. The pace and directness of Rashford and Martial saw United grow as an attacking threat, but the visitors still needed a world-class save from David de Gea, denying Aguero's 32rd-minute drive, to keep City at bay. Aguero turned stand-in centre-back Daley Blind inside out two minutes later but he rashly blazed over the bar, before De Bruyne's thumping drive drew De Gea into action. Yaya Toure (left) rides the challenge of Henrikh Mkhitaryan Raheem Sterling burst forward two minutes before the interval but the quality of his finish was found wanting as he too fired over. United should have taken the lead on the stroke of half-time, but an unmarked Ander Herrera somehow managed to steer Rashford's free-kick wide from six yards, typifying a frustrating opening period for the Manchester rivals. Sterling's finishing was found wanting early in the second period when his tame shot was saved, before Matteo Darmian's hesitancy when clearing presented Fernandinho with a chance, only for the ball to race clear. De Bruyne's deflected drive nestled in the side-netting shortly before the hour as City strengthen their grip on possession and the flow of the game. Eric Bailly inadvertently blocked Nicolas Otamendi's goal-bound header on 67 minutes before Sterling managed to test De Gea with a shot four minutes later. Aguero shows his frustration after missing a chance A largely uneventful game erupted seven minutes from time when Fellaini, having just been booked for preventing Aguero from breaking, hauled the Argentine down. Aguero's appeals for a second yellow prompted a wild reaction from Fellaini, who threw his head towards the City striker, earning a straight red from referee Martin Atkinson. City, looking to capitalise on their man advantage, brought on Jesus and the Brazilian sent the Etihad into raptures when headed the ball into the United net in stoppage-time, but the linesman correctly ruled it out for offside. Aguero then blazed a glorious chance over at the death United held on for a point - how crucial it will be in the race for Europe remains to be seen.

Despite having nearly 70 per cent possession, Arsenal failed to break down the Foxes back line until the 86th minute, when Nacho Monreal's wayward effort hit the unfortunate Huth and deflected past Kasper Schmeichel. Leicester twice went close through Riyad Mahrez in the first half, while Alexis Sanchez crashed a long-range effort off the crossbar on the stroke of half-time. The result means Arsenal are now four points off fourth-place Manchester City and six off third-place Liverpool, though the Gunners have two games in hand on Jurgen Klopp's side. Arsene Wenger opted for a 3-5-2 formation again, starting Monreal as part of the central defensive three, while Theo Walcott started up front for the Gunners. Leonardo Ulloa vies with Laurent Koscielny Despite Arsenal's dominance in possession, it was Leicester who had the first two chances of the game as Jamie Vardy struck just wide from a Marc Albrighton cut-back, before Mahrez forced Petr Cech into a fine save with a fierce half-volley from 10 yards. Walcott then brought another save from Schmeichel with a poked effort from eight yards, while at the other end, Mahrez hit the side-netting on the break. Arsenal ended the half on a promising note as Sanchez went close, hitting the bar with a superb effort from 25 yards following what was a hugely frustrating opening 45 minutes for the Chilean. Wilfred Ndidi looks to steal the ball from Theo Walcott Schmeichel had to be alert in the second half as Granit Xhaka's deflected shot almost caught him off guard, before sub Shinji Okazaki had an effort from 12 yards blocked brilliantly by man-of-the-match Gabriel. Arsenal finally broke the deadlock with four minutes remaining as the ball broke to Monreal on the edge of the box. His effort, which was heading well wide of goal, came off the chest of Huth as Olivier Giroud put him under pressure, leaving Schmeichel no chance. There was an embarrassing incident in the final moments as a frustrated Christian Fuchs directed a throw-in towards the head of Sanchez at point-blank range, after the Arsenal man had been standing on the byline in an attempt to put the Austrian off. Mesut Ozil and Wilfred Ndidi tussle in midfield Sanchez, who was hit on his shoulder but belatedly went down holding his face, was booked for the incident, before Arsenal held on for a much-needed victory.

Middlesbrough 1-0 Sunderland Middlesbrough 1-0 Sunderland Middlesbrough boosted their slim survival hopes while all-but ending Sunderland's with a 1-0 Tees-Wear derby victory at the Riverside Stadium. Marten de Roon's eighth-minute strike for a superior Boro outfit proved decisive as Steve Agnew claimed the first victory of his tenure on Teesside. The victory, Boro's fifth of the season, moves them to within six points of safety and six clear of Sunderland, with four games left to secure their top-flight status. For Sunderland, despite having a game in hand on their relegation rivals, defeat leaves them 12 points from safety, rooted to the foot of the Premier League. It means David Moyes' men will be relegated if they lose to Bournemouth next time out, and Hull get a point against Southampton. Marten de Roon scores for Middlesbrough against Sunderland On a night where both clubs' top-fight status virtually hung on the result, nerves seem to get the better of Boro, who invited pressure in the opening exchanges, Jermain Defoe's volley drawing Brad Guzan into action on seven minutes. Both those jitters were put to one side in emphatic fashion in the eighth minute as Adam Clayton's floated pass released De Roon and the Dutchman, who showed a greater desire than Jordan Pickford to reach the ball, slotted the hosts in front. 2 - Marten De Roon has scored two goals in his last four Premier League appearances, as many as in his previous 26 combined. Utility. — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) April 26, 2017 One should have become two in the 20th minute but Pickford came to Sunderland's rescue, denying Stewart Downing his first goal since October 29 after a defensive mix-up involving Billy Jones and Jason Denayer. Such was Boro's dominance that Calum Chambers was given licence to join in with attacks, but his 23rd-minute drive flashed a yard wide. Sunderland manager David Moyes catches the ball Sunderland regrouped and tested Guzan for the second time on 34 minutes, Didier Ndong's rasping drive stinging the palms of the American. Guzan made a fine diving save to prevent Wahbi Khazri's free-kick from levelling the game three minutes into the second period. And the Boro stopper was the centre of attention four minutes later when his attempted punched clearance led Victor Anichebe to go to ground, but referee Mike Dean was unmoved by the penalty appeal. From then on, a valiant defensive display from Boro kept a Sunderland side bereft of ideas at bay, despite Fabio Borini and Adnan Januzaj entering the fray. Downing nearly capped a potentially defining victory with a late drive but his miss did not take the gloss off the performance for Boro, who prevailed in the 130th league meeting between the two North East rivals.

After Chelsea's victory over Southampton stretched their lead at the top to seven points, this was a boom or bust scenario for Spurs, who left it late to cut the gap back to four with five games to go. Eriksen produced the boom with a rare bit of quality in a scrappy game, firing home a wondrous 30-yard strike straight into the bottom corner with 12 minutes left, which made it eight league wins in a row for Mauricio Pochettino's men. Mauricio Pochettino felt his side fully deserved their win over Crystal Palace and has challenged them to maintain the pressure on Chelsea Mauricio Pochettino felt his side fully deserved their win over Crystal Palace and has challenged them to maintain the pressure on Chelsea Palace had won six of their last eight Premier League games but despite looking resolute in defence, offered little going forward and lost Mamadou Sakho to a serious looking knee injury. The title race now rolls onto Super Sunday, where Chelsea visit Everton before Tottenham host Arsenal in a mouth-watering north London derby, with both games are live on Sky Sports. Kyle Walker, who came into the Spurs team along with Ben Davies, saw plenty of the ball in the early stages but failed to find Harry Kane in the middle with some sloppy crossing. It rather summed up Spurs' performance in the opening half as Palace looked strong and organised without the ball. Chances were at a premium, which frustrated the visitors, who were perhaps lucky not to be reduced to 10-men on 34 minutes when Victor Wanyama - already on a booking - slid in and got nowhere near the ball as Andros Townsend nicked the ball past him. The contact was minimal but referee Jon Moss had a long chat with the Spurs midfielder, letting him know that he was walking a fine line. Wanyama and Mousa Dembele were replaced at the break as Pochettino tried to inject some tempo in their attacking play - but they continued to struggle to find gaps in Palace's back-line. Mousa Dembele and Wilfried Zaha battle for the ball during the Selhurst Park encounter The turning point in the game was perhaps when Sakho left the field on a stretcher after severely twisting his knee when trying to foul Kane. The loss of the on-loan Liverpool man seemed to make Tottenham believe a winning goal was possible and Dele Alli squandered a presentable chance on 58 minutes when planting a volley from close range just wide of the far post. Mamadou Sakho had to be stretchered off during the home match with Spurs It was one-way traffic towards the Palace goal, but a clinical final ball from Spurs was missing with Kane, who headed straight at Wayne Hennessey, and Walker both going close. Quality was in short supply and Chelsea must have been thinking a six-point gap was theirs - until Tottenham's great Dane produced a moment of magic on 78 minutes. Harry Kane says it was a tough game, but that made victory 'perfect' for Tottenham against Crystal Palace Harry Kane says it was a tough game, but that made victory 'perfect' for Tottenham against Crystal Palace Picking the ball up about 25 yards from goal, he drew back his right foot and struck an exquisite effort low and hard, which swerved and wobbled into the bottom corner. It was the only wobble on the night for Spurs, who have now kept 16 clean sheets this season - more than any other side, and they saw the game out comfortably.

"report": "2:53 Chelsea 4-2 Southampton Chelsea 4-2 Southampton Diego Costa reached a Premier League milestone as Chelsea tightened their grip on the title with a 4-2 win over Southampton at Stamford Bridge. Former Blues midfielder Oriol Romeu (24) had cancelled out Eden Hazard's early opener (5) but fit-again Gary Cahill restored their lead just before the break and Costa then netted twice to end a seven-game drought in style, the first his 50th in England's top flight. Ryan Bertrand headed an injury-time consolation for a Southampton side that fought gamely but a victory that feels pivotal sees Antonio Conte's men stretch their lead at the top to seven points. Diego Costa celebrates scoring Chelsea's fourth against Southampton Nearest rivals Tottenham can cut the gap again by beating Crystal Palace on Wednesday - live on Sky Sports - but after their FA Cup semi-final win over Mauricio Pochettino's challengers at the weekend, the Blues landed another psychological blow with just five games left. Conte had restored Hazard and Costa to his line-up after starting them on the bench at Wembley, but a Blues backline bolstered by Cahill following illness had an early scare when David Luiz and Cesar Azpilicueta dithered with Manolo Gabbiadini lurking. Eden Hazard scored Chelsea's opener against Southampton A smart set-piece saw Dusan Tadic loop a ball to Jack Stephens at the far post, his volley too tame to trouble, but Chelsea responded with a sweeping attack, Costa delaying his cut-back so Hazard could swing without breaking stride to find the bottom corner. Southampton responded, Tadic and Cedric Soares involved in a one-touch move that Sofiane Boufal might have finished, but the hosts broke at ominous pace and Hazard came close to a second (18), leaning back when Costa deftly flicked into his path as Conte howled into his hands on the touchline. Steven Davis saw a long-range effort deflected wide but the visitors drew level from the subsequent corner when Azpilicueta nodded backwards and Gabbiadini centred from an angle, Thibaut Courtois parrying only as far as Romeu as Chelsea's Premier League run without a clean sheet stretched to 11 games. The home fans roared as Chelsea upped the tempo, N'Golo Kante seizing the moment with a driving run from wide right to byline, before Costa fell in the box under the legitimate attention of Davis and Nemanja Matic - urged on after his weekend thunderbolt - lashed off-target. Oriol Romeu scored against his former club but it proved in vain Boufal smashed into side-netting as the Saints' set-piece armoury continued to cause bother but Chelsea finished the half strongly and made it count when Marcos Alonso headed Kante's floated delivery back across goal and Cahill rose, applying a rudimentary finish as Costa shaped for an overhead kick. Southampton snapped into tackles after half-time encouragement but Chelsea settled any jitters just minutes after the break when Cesc Fabregas showed for a short corner then scooped a ball with his laces that Costa muscled his way to meet, stooping to plant past Fraser Forster (54). Claude Puel threw on Nathan Redmond in a bid to wrestle back momentum and Conte booted the bench as another corner carried danger, Gabbiadini blasting into the netting after a controlling touch made the angle too tight (70). Gary Cahill restored Chelsea's lead just before half-time Fabregas, whose weighted pass for Costa had set up the opener, made way to hearty applause and though a late comeback never looked likely, Davis drilled a loose ball goalwards that, with Courtois committed, needed an intervention. Chelsea tore forward as space opened up, Kante's chip palmed away by Forster (81), but the job here was done and satisfied home hordes took further delight in a late cameo for departing John Terry. Costa sealed a convincing win a minute from time, sparking a stylish move with a give-and-go on the edge of the box before slotting low into the corner, and though there was still time for more action, Bertrand's injury-time header (90+4) was a mere blot as Conte's men edge closer.

Anthony Martial scored his 25th goal for United after a devastating counter-attack 21 minutes in to give the visitors the lead, before the returning Rooney - making his first start since early March - bundled the ball home six minutes before the break to make it two. United's tempo dropped after the interval but they were rarely troubled by a Burnley side who have won just once in 11 league games, and are now just five points clear of the bottom three. Rooney celebrates Anthony Martial's opener for United The result means that is now 23 games unbeaten in the league for United, who move to within a point of Manchester City in fourth ahead of Thursday's Manchester derby, live on Sky Sports. Rooney was back in the starting line-up for United, as was Martial, who replaced the injured Zlatan Ibrahimovic as the central striker, but they were bystanders in the early stages as Burnley did all the early pressing, Robbie Brady going close with a volley. Nine minutes in, Rooney was given the chance to get his return to the side off to a flier after Martial had fed Ander Herrera and the Spaniard had poked the ball into Rooney's feet, but though the United skipper swivelled and flicked for goal, Ben Mee did brilliantly to half-block, making Tom Heaton's save more comfortable. Martial and Rooney both impressed on their return to the starting XI Rooney then looped a cross-shot onto the roof of the Burnley net as United countered at will, but the Clarets remained a threat themselves with some direct play. It wasn't long before a United counter paid dividends, however, as Martial opened the scoring. The France international carried the ball clear after a Burnley corner and laid it off to Herrera, before collecting the return pass and slotting home - a goal that is now set to trigger an £8.4m bonus payment to Monaco. Burnley responded well, and put plenty of crosses into the United box, but Mourinho's men stood firm, and six minutes before the break, they were two goals to the good. Pogba did brilliantly to keep the move alive, dragging the ball away from the defender before nudging it through for Martial, who was denied by Heaton, the ball rebounded to Rooney, who just sneaked the ball over the line. After the break, Burnley really struggled to find any fluidity, and Pogba almost made them pay for their sloppy play, as he picked up the loose ball, before rifling an effort at goal, but Heaton got two strong hands to the ball to beat it away. Paul Pogba (left) takes on Andre Gray in the early stages at Turf Moor The game petered out as the half wore on, with Michael Keane going closest to getting his Burnley side back in the match late on, but he headed wide after getting up highest to meet a free-kick. Substitute Marcus Rashford and Pogba again almost netted a third late on, but were both denied by the fingertips of Heaton as United saw the game out with relative ease.

"2:29 Highlights as Crystal Palace came from behind to beat Liverpool 2-1 at Anfield on Sunday Highlights as Crystal Palace came from behind to beat Liverpool 2-1 at Anfield on Sunday Christian Benteke scored twice on his Anfield return as Crystal Palace came from behind to beat Liverpool 2-1 on Sunday. Philippe Coutinho had put Liverpool ahead on 24 minutes with a glorious curling free-kick from distance but Benteke levelled just before half-time, exploiting some slack defending to convert at the far post. Former Liverpool striker Benteke then headed a 74th-minute winner after the home side failed to deal with a corner, his fifth goal as an opposition player at Anfield denting his old club's top-four hopes. The result leaves Liverpool just three points clear of fifth-placed Manchester United, who have two games in hand on the Reds, but sends Palace seven points clear of relegation. Christian Benteke and Mamadou Sakho celebrate Crystal Palace's equaliser against Liverpool with a game of rock, paper, scissors. But who won? Christian Benteke and Mamadou Sakho celebrate Crystal Palace's equaliser against Liverpool with a game of rock, paper, scissors. But who won? Mamadou Sakho, ineligible to play against his parent club, was replaced by James Tomkins in the Palace defence, while Jurgen Klopp named an unchanged starting XI despite pre-match rhetoric of injury problems. Palace, whose last five wins have been with their lowest possession of the season, were happy to let Liverpool have the ball early on and look for either the wings or target-man Benteke as an outlet. Liverpool's Brazilian midfielder Philippe Coutinho (C) opened the scoring with a free-kick The Belgian carved out the game's first chance after 19 minutes, shrugging off Lucas Leiva then dancing between Dejan Lovren and Joel Matip before curling a shot just wide of the post. Kept at distance by the Palace defence, Coutinho needed a set-piece to finally pick his spot, sending Hennessey dashing across goal in vain with an inch-perfect free-kick to put Liverpool ahead midway through the first half. Crystal Palace duo of Andros Townsend and Christian Benteke say their win over Liverpool gives them a little breathing space going into the final few games Crystal Palace duo of Andros Townsend and Christian Benteke say their win over Liverpool gives them a little breathing space going into the final few games But Klopp's side were unable to hold on to their lead until half-time. Minutes after being booked for diving, an unmarked Benteke finished into the roof of the net from Yohan Cabaye's cross to the back post (42), following up an initially muted celebration with a rock-paper-scissors handshake with on-loan team-mate Sakho. Liverpool pressed after the break, with Coutinho clipped by Martin Kelly in the Palace box but staying on his feet to see his shot blocked. Christian Benteke played down celebrations when he scored against former club Liverpool at Anfield Cabaye blazed over the bar from just yards out in the 71st minute as Palace continued to threaten on the break, and delivered a decisive blow just three minutes later. Liverpool failed to clear a Palace corner and Benteke was allowed to run free into the six-yard box and he stooped low to head home beyond Simon Mignolet. Klopp, limited in first-team players on the bench, threw on Marko Grujic, Alberto Moreno and Trent Alexander-Arnold in search of an equaliser, but Palace held on for their sixth win in eight games under Allardyce as Liverpool surrendered ground in the race for Champions League qualification.

"report": "2:48 Bournemouth 4-0 Middlesbrough Bournemouth 4-0 Middlesbrough Bournemouth beat 10-man Middlesbrough 4-0 on Saturday to strengthen their Premier League place while sending their opponents closer to the drop. The home side took the lead after just 90 seconds as Josh King swept home from seven yards, before Benik Afobe made it 2-0 following a mishap in the Boro defence. Boro's task was made harder when Gaston Ramirez was sent off for two unnecessary yellow cards in the space of seven minutes, leaving the visitors down to 10 men for the remaining three quarters of the game. The hosts wrapped up the points in the second half through Marc Pugh's fine finish from 20 yards and Charlie Daniels' strike from a well-worked free-kick. The result means Middlesbrough are now nine points off safety with five games to play, though they do have a game in hand. Bournemouth are now up to 12th, seven points clear of the drop with 12 points to play for. Benik Afobe celebrates after giving Bournemouth a 2-0 lead Before the game, both sets of fans and players took part in a minute's applause in memory of Ugo Ehiogu, who died on Friday at the age of 44. Ehiogu played at Boro between 2001 and 2007. It took Bournemouth only a minute-and-a-half to take the lead through King's 12th goal in 16 Premier League games, finishing off a good move inside the box after Pugh's centre from the byline. It was 2-0 after 16 minutes when Adam Clayton was dispossessed on the edge of the box by Harry Arter, handing Afobe the simple task of sticking the ball home from 10 yards unmarked. Bournemouth and Middlesbrough players stand for a minute's applause to honour Ugo Ehiogu King should have made it 3-0 moments later, hitting the side-netting when through on goal, before Boro were reduced to 10 men. Having received a booking for a blatant dive minutes before, Ramirez was dismissed for a late tackle on Pugh, although contact with the Bournemouth man was minimal. Boro almost halved the deficit through Marten de Roon on the half-hour mark, but his superb half volley from long range was tipped wide brilliantly by Artur Boruc. Guzan made two fine saves to keep the score at 2-0 after the break, first from Afobe's diving header at the far post and then Ryan Fraser's long-range effort. Alvaro Negredo is put under pressure by Harry Arter and Dan Gosling But he could do nothing about Bournemouth's third, as Pugh (65) found the far corner after cutting in from the left and producing a scorching effort from 20 yards out. Daniels made it 4-0 after 70 minutes, receiving Fraser's clever free-kick and finishing into the bottom corner from 20 yards after Boro failed to close him down. Substitute Lys Mousset should have made it five with a minute remaining, but he volleyed over the bar from eight yards after Boro again failed to clear the ball from a cross. The result continues Boro's woeful run of form, leaving Steve Agnew's men without a top flight win since mid-December, 16 games ago.

Marco Silva's gameplan took a hit after just 25 minutes when Oumar Niasse received his marching orders for a high foot on M'Baye Niang; a decision greeted by controversy among both the players and the KCOM faithful. Just after the hour mark, Kamil Grosicki led a swift counter (62) after a Watford free-kick was cleared and squared for Markovic who headed onto the underside of the bar, before lashing in the rebound from close range. And nine minutes later Clucas rounded off the performance with a stunner (71), volleying home a Watford clearance from 30 yards to continue their fine run of home form and keep the threat of the drop at bay. Watford reached the sacred 40-point survival milestone last weekend against Swansea, but with just two points separating Hull and 18th-placed Swansea, the stakes were high in east Yorkshire. Oumar Niasse struggled to hide his dismay at Bobby Madley's decision The starting eleven of both sides remained largely unaltered from last weekend; Miguel Britos replaced Adrian Mariappa in the centre of the Hornets defence, while for the home side, Tom Huddlestone and Michael Dawson made way from Ahmed Elmohamady and Evandro. The game started with early confusion in the Tigers' defence when Harry Maguire passed a free-kick back to Eldin Jakupovic, the 'keeper forced to recover well to prevent a calamitous own goal. Clucas swiped over the first Hull chance of the game on 16 minutes, but just nine minutes later, the mood of the game shifted when Niasse and Niang simultaneously challenged for the same ball. Lazar Markovic opened the scoring against Watford on Saturday Niasse's contact on the AC Milan loanee's shin was minimal, but there can be no question his studs were raised, the aptly-placed Bobby Madley took mere seconds to brandish the red card, much to the frontman's dismay. With 12 minutes remaining in the half, Jose Holebas' corner was powerfully met by Sebastian Prodl as he leapt alongside Andrea Ranocchia; Jakupovic had to display his best reactions as he pushed the header over the bar. Hull rode out the remainder of the half on tenterhooks, and the half-time whistle was met by relief from the players, while boos directed at Madley rang out from the stands. The second half began in a tardy fashion, but after an hour that was all to change; Grosicki charged down the left and beat both Tom Cleverley and Nordin Amrabat. The attack came to nothing but it was a pre-cursor to what was to happen just minutes later. A Hornets free-kick was headed away by Maguire, before the ball found its way to Grosicki on the left. He drove forward and spotted Markovic in the centre of the 18-yard box, before looping in a cross that the winger headed onto the underside of the bar. The goal decision system ruled the ball had not crossed the line, but Markovic lashed the rebound over the line for good measure. Sam Clucas' stunner capped a superb second half performance from Hull Clucas curled a 25-yard free-kick narrowly wide before he doubled the scoring two minutes later, bringing down a Watford clearance and arrowing a 30-yard stunner past a helpless Heurelho Gomes. Watford hadn't really threatened thanks to the resolute defending of Maguire but this was the final nail in the coffin, Mazzarri bringing on Isaac Success and Stefano Okaka to little effect.

Fernando Llorente set the Swans on their way to victory, heading his 12th goal of the season home with after 10 minutes. A minute after Marko Arnautovic blazed a second-half penalty over, Tom Carroll's deflected effort wrapped up a crucial set of three points for Paul Clement's side. A first win in seven league outings keeps the Swans just behind relegation rivals Hull, whom they trail by just two points. Stoke, meanwhile, remain 11th in the table after losing for the fifth time in their last six games. Both sides welcomed back long-term absentees as Swansea captain Leon Britton played for the first time since New Year's Eve while Stoke goalkeeper Jack Butland made his first appearance since March 2016. With Swans boss Clement expecting relegation rivals Hull to win on Saturday, the hosts could ill-afford to drop points, and they flew out of the traps against a lethargic Stoke team. It took just 10 minutes for Swansea to hit the front, Llorente powering a header past Butland - a perfect response to pre-match criticism he received for a perceived sluggish style of play. Fernando Llorente celebrates scoring the opening goal against Stoke Swansea's positive start was stifled by an injury to Leroy Fer but his replacement, Sung-yeung Ki, ensured the Swans remained on top. That bright start so nearly counted for nothing, but Saido Berahino headed a glorious chance wide on 31 minutes, as his wait for a first Stoke goal continued. Jordan Ayew flashed an effort through Butland's legs and across the goal line in first-half stoppage-time as the hosts looked to end the half with a flourish. Gylfi Sigurdsson is closed down by Joe Allen Potential joy nearly turned agony for the hosts, but Berahino's troubles in front of goal continued as he headed Peter Crouch's knock-down straight at Lukasz Fabianski a minute later. Swansea started the second half brightly but Stoke created the first opening on 69 minutes when referee Michael Oliver awarded a penalty after Federico Fernandez's challenge on Xherdan Shaqiri. But a troubling afternoon in south Wales took a turn for the worse for the Potters as Arnautovic fired over from 12 yards. To add further insult, Swansea then swiftly doubled their lead, Carroll's long-range strike deflecting off Joe Allen and beyond the despairing reach of Butland. Tom Carroll celebrates putting Swansea City 2-0 up at the Liberty Stadium Butland was on hand to prevent Carroll from doubling his tally on 73 minutes, tipping the midfielder's long-range strike over the bar. Bruno Martins Indi fired a late chance over the bar but it proved immaterial, with Swansea's lead secure; whether their top-flight status is as safe remains to be seen. 1:00 - There was exactly one minute between Marko Arnautovic's missed penalty & Tom Carroll's goal for @SwansOfficial.

In a game of very few chances, West Ham, marshalled by Jose Fonte and James Collins, nullified the threat of the Premier League's top goalscorer Romelu Lukaku, who barely had a shot on goal. The hosts were the more threatening side as the game wore on with Manuel Lanzini and James Collins both forcing saves from Maarten Stekelenburg, but neither side could break the deadlock on what was a frustrating afternoon in east London. The point inches Slaven Bilic's side closer to top-flight safety - they are now seven points above the drop zone with four matches remaining. Everton, they move back above Arsenal into sixth but are two points behind Manchester United in fifth having played three more games than Jose Mourinho's men, who take on Burnley live on Nissan Super Sunday. West Ham made four changes with Jonathan Calleri making his first Premier League start in place of the injured Andy Carroll, while there was a change in goal for Everton with Stekelenburg replacing Joel Robles. There was a slow start to proceedings at the London Stadium with the pace of the game representing that of an end of season game. Adrian, who was back in goal in place of Darren Randolph, nearly produced a costly error when his clearance was charged down by Lukaku, but the Spanish goalkeeper quickly pounced on the ball ahead of Kevin Mirallas. It took until the 29th minute for the first shot to come and it fell to West Ham but Havard Nordtveit's deflected strike was easily saved by Stekelenburg. Jonathan Calleri is challenged by Ashley Williams at The London Stadium Cheikhou Kouyate then found some space 25 yards from goal but fired his shot wide of the post before Collins headed wide from Lanzini's cross as West Ham finished the half the stronger of the two sides. Ronaldo Koeman reacted at the break by sending on Gareth Barry and Ademola Lookman for Idrissa Gueye and Tom Davies. But it was West Ham who continued their momentum and Lanzini was in the thick of the action again. Andre Ayew picked out Edimilson Fernandes in acres of space on the right flank and the Swiss midfielder's scuffed shot found its way to Lanzini, but defender Phil Jagielka came to the rescue for the visitors, throwing himself at the shot to block with his head. Lukaku had a brief sight of goal as he found space on the right before brusting into the penalty area and beating Collins. However, the Belgium international dwindled on the ball too long as Fonte was there to dispossess the forward. Arthur Masuaku puts pressure on Ademola Lookman in the game at London Stadium Lookman, who had looked bright since coming off the bench, produced Everton's best shot of the game after 71 minutes, dragging a shot wide of Adrian's post. Moments later, the 19-year-old created another opening on the left-hand side but sent effort just over the crossbar. Another half-chance went begging for Ronald Koeman's side late on as substitute Dominic Calvert-Lewin produced the perfect cross for Lukaku but the ball sailed over the head of the Belgian. A last throw of the dice from West Ham in the final 10 minutes saw a corner find Fonte at the back post but his header was saved by Stekelenburg.

In what was billed as a must-win game for both teams for very different reasons, Arsene Wenger started with three at the back for the first time since 1997. But it was through a sublime Sanchez free-kick that Arsenal took the lead before Alvaro Negredo equalised just after the break. Ozil won the game for the Gunners with 19 minutes remaining as they moved to within seven points of Manchester City in fourth with a game in hand. Sanchez and Ozil's deals run out at the end of next season and, as with manager Arsene Wenger, there is huge uncertainty regarding their futures. The defeat for Middlesbrough leaves them without a win in 2017 and six points from safety with six games to play. Fabio da Silva takes on Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain In a bid to arrest four straight away defeats, Wenger freshened up his squad with the new formation and five changes from the team that limped to a 3-0 reverse at Crystal Palace. One of those changes saw Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain employed as a right-wing back and he struggled to get his bearings in the early stages, picking up a booking for a late foul on Fabio. Both teams struggled to find space in key areas due to the congested midfield. The game needed a flash of brilliance to break the deadlock - and Sanchez provided it three minutes before half-time. Alexis Sanchez of Arsenal is challenged by Ben Gibson of Middlesbrough Adam Clayton clumsily took down Granit Xhaka about 22 yards out, which presented the Gunners with an opportunity dead centre of goal. Both Ozil and Sanchez lined it up, but it was the Chilean who stepped up, whipping the ball skilfully over the wall and into the net. Middlesbrough goalkeeper Brad Guzan could only stop and stare as Sanchez wheeled away to celebrate his 19th Premier League of the season. The platform was there for Arsenal to kick on, however, their defensive fragility surfaced again after the break as Boro drew level on 50 minutes. On his 250th league appearance for Middlesbrough, Stewart Downing rolled back the years and provided his first Premier League assist for 17 matches. The winger roared forward down the right flank, cut inside and floated a wonderful ball into the box which caught Laurent Koscielny out of position. Negredo attacked the ball and poked it home with the underside of his boot to net his ninth league goal of the campaign. Arsenal's striker Alexis Sanchez celebrates an important win The Riverside Stadium was now rocking and the Middlesbrough players sensed weakness in the Arsenal backline. Downing's set-piece from the right found George Friend at the back post and his header found Daniel Ayala, who was only four yards out. The crowd expected the net to bulge but Ayala's diving header was poorly directed and Petr Cech made an outstanding block to keep the scores level. It was potentially a huge moment in Boro's season. Minutes later, Sanchez picked out Ozil with a delightful through ball but Guzan was just about quick enough off his line to divert the ball away from danger. Ozil wasn't to be denied though as he popped up to make it 2-1 on 71 minutes. Arsenal's striker Alexis Sanchez celebrates an important win Livewire Boro substitute Adama Traore handed possession back to Arsenal inside his own half and two passes later, the ball was in the net. Sanchez chipped a clever ball to Ramsey inside the area, who chested the ball into the path of Ozil to fire home from 10 yards. Middlesbrough's best route for an equaliser came from set-pieces and their best chance fell to skipper Ben Gibson with four minutes to play. However, his close-range effort after yet more shaky Arsenal defending was seized upon by Cech.

Roberto Firmino's goal earned a 1-0 victory at West Brom on Super Sunday. The Brazilian headed in the only goal of the game just before half-time to settle affairs at the Hawthorns and extend his side's unbeaten run to seven matches. West Brom will rue golden opportunities missed by Nacer Chadli and Matt Phillips, while James Milner should have volleyed in a second for Liverpool early in the second half and Alberto Moreno missed an open goal from 35 yards late on. The victory moves Jurgen Klopp's side up to third on 66 points - nine clear of fifth-placed Everton - with five games to play. West Brom remain in eighth position. Brazilian duo Firmino and Philippe Coutinho were restored to the starting line-up after both scored from the bench against Stoke last week and they combined to create Liverpool's first chance, Firmino slotting narrowly wide across Ben Foster from his team-mate's pass. Nacer Chadli and Georginio Wijnaldum of Liverpool battle for possession Phillips was the chief architect for West Brom in the first half with his scuffed shot almost being turned in by Hal Robson-Kanu in the third minute and he later crossed for Chadi, who somehow failed to connect from six yards with the goal gaping. Firmino guided a volley wide from a Coutinho cross and Robson-Kanu shot straight at Simon Mignolet as the first half looked destined to end goalless - until Chris Brunt fouled Divock Origi in added time. From Milner's free-kick, Lucas headed the ball on for Firmino, who evaded the attention of Craig Dawson to nod past Foster from six yards and give Liverpool the lead. Roberto Firmino and Emre Can celebrate the Brazilian's winning goal The goalscorer almost created a second in the 57th minute when he sent a pin-point cross in the direction of Milner at the far post - however the unmarked left-back volleyed over the bar from inside the six-yard box. Firmino was then flagged offside when he headed Lucas' ball across goal and Origi turned it into the net, while Coutinho blasted an effort over the bar just after the hour mark. Tony Pulis sent on three substitutes - James Morrison, James McClean and Salomon Rondon - with more than 25 minutes left to play and the latter carved out a glorious opportunity with 10 minutes left. Hal Robson-Kanu and Dejan Lovren had a lively tussle Rondon played a perfect pass through to Phillips who raced beyond the defence and only had Mignolet to beat, but the Liverpool goalkeeper rushed out to make a crucial save. Substitute Moreno should have scored a second in injury-time when goalkeeper Foster went forward for a West Brom corner and Liverpool broke away - but he haplessly failed to steer his 35-yard effort on the empty goal on target. Simon Mignolet was delighted Liverpool managed to keep a clean sheet after the recent criticism of their defence Simon Mignolet was delighted Liverpool managed to keep a clean sheet after the recent criticism of their defence Foster was effectively playing in midfield in a chaotic final minute, but Liverpool held on to take all three points and will continue their top-four push at home to Crystal Palace live on next week's Super Sunday.

Marcus Rashford's early strike and a deflected Ander Herrera effort were the difference between the teams on Sunday, as the gap between Antonio Conte's men and Tottenham in second place remains at four points with six games to play. Ander Herrera felt Manchester United produced a perfect performance against Chelsea Ander Herrera felt Manchester United produced a perfect performance against Chelsea However, Chelsea, who have been top since November 5, appear to have an easier run-in than Spurs as they only have to face one side in the top six, while the north Londoners have home matches against Arsenal and United. For United boss Jose Mourinho, who decided to rest Zlatan Ibrahmovic, the result leaves his team just four points behind Manchester City in fourth with a game in hand and stretches their unbeaten run in the Premier League to 22 games - the longest current unbeaten run in Europe's top five leagues. Marcus Rashford scores the opening goal The decision to rest Ibrahimovic was one of four changes from United's draw at Anderlecht on Thursday night as Jesse Lingard and Rashford lead the line. Thibaut Courtois picked up an ankle injury in training for Chelsea while Marcus Alonso felt unwell in the warm-up as Conte had to shuffle his pack. United's reliance on 28-goal Ibrahimovic this season has been a bugbear for Mourinho, who has openly criticised his attackers for not taking their chances. He would have been forgiven for thinking it would be another one of those days when Rashford shanked a presentable chance after running behind David Luiz on four minutes. Manchester United striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic was rested However, Mourinho did not have to wait long for the opener as Chelsea failed to heed Rashford's speedy warning. Nemanja Matic's pass in midfield was blocked by Herrera's hand but referee Bobby Madley saw no infringement and the Spaniard, who started at right-back to deal with Eden Hazard, sprung into action. He lifted his head and picked out an exquisite pass in behind Luiz, which was straight into Rashford's path. The striker stayed cool under pressure and lifted the ball over Begovic into the far corner to score his first goal in 20 Premier League appearances. Rashford celebrates his goal with team-mates It was the first time United have scored at Old Trafford before the 21st minute this season and Chelsea looked stunned. Meanwhile, United were at full throttle with Rashford leading the line with great maturity. He was inches away from tapping home skipper Ashley Young's low cross on 16 minutes before whipping over a tasty cross of his own four minutes later which Begovic clawed to safety. Gary Cahill admitted Chelsea performed below the standards that they have set themselves Gary Cahill admitted Chelsea performed below the standards that they have set themselves Chelsea's frustrations were summed up by Diego Costa, who was in a typically grizzly mood and picked up a booking on 32 minutes for a late tackle on Paul Pogba. Undeterred by the caution, Costa then clashed with Marcos Rojo inside the United area, as both players' theatrics were ignored by Madley. Chelsea's first shot on goal came just before half-time when Costa blazed wide from 30 yards. A reaction was expected from the lacklustre visitors after the break, but, instead, it was United that grabbed the crucial second goal of the game on 49 minutes. Some determined work down the left flank by Young caused the Chelsea back-line to drop deep. The ball popped out to Herrera on the edge of the box and his effort took a big deflection off Kurt Zouma before flying past Begovic. Ander Herrera of Manchester United scores his side's second goal The ruthless attacking play that has seen Chelsea score 65 goals this season was non-existent as United soaked up plenty of possession without really being troubled. Pedro fired a speculative attempt over the crossbar on 65 minutes - and that was as good as it got for the nervous west Londoners. Before Sunday's blank, Chelsea last failed to score in the Premier League in a 2-0 defeat at Tottenham - and it is Spurs that are on their tail with the finishing line in sight.

Spurs 4-0 Bournemouth Spurs 4-0 Bournemouth Tottenham maintained their relentless pursuit of Chelsea in the title race with a 4-0 win over Bournemouth, cutting the deficit to just four points. Goals from Mousa Dembele, Heung-Min Son, Harry Kane - who was making his first start since returning from ankle ligament trouble - and substitute Vincent Janssen saw off a timid Bournemouth side and stretched Spurs' winning run in the Premier League to seven games, which is their longest league run of victories for 50 years. The victory extended their unbeaten run at home this season, which now stands at 17 games, including winning the last 11. Harry Kane and Mousa Dembele gave their reaction to Spurs' 4-0 demolition of Bournemouth as both players got on the scoresheet Harry Kane and Mousa Dembele gave their reaction to Spurs' 4-0 demolition of Bournemouth as both players got on the scoresheet Chelsea have a chance to respond in their game in hand on Spurs when they visit Manchester United, live on Super Sunday. Kane, who replaced Janssen up front in one of two changes from Tottenham's victory over Watford, was seemingly in the mood to make up for lost time in his bid for goals and threatened early on. His close-range effort was beaten away by Artur Boruc on five minutes, although the offside flag had been raised. Heung-Min Son celebrates scoring Tottenham's second goal in a dominant performance Bournemouth needed to defend with perfect concentration in order to keep the rampant hosts at bay, but their resistance only lasted 16 minutes as Dembele grabbed his first goal of the season. A delivery from a left wing corner from Christian Eriksen landed at the feet of an unmarked Dembele at the back post, who made no mistake in rifling home. Mauricio Pochettino looks on from the sideline at White Hart Lane Spurs only needed to wait three minutes to double their lead as the Cherries displayed more haphazard defending. Jack Wilshere, whose every touch was roundly booed by the home fans, played a sloppy ball in midfield which was seized upon by Eriksen. The Denmark international fed Kane, who flicked a wonderful ball into Son's path and the South Korea international motored through on goal before slipping the ball into the far corner for his fifth goal from his last six shots on target in the Premier League. There was no response from the visitors as Boruc was by far the busier of the two goalkeepers, making smart low saves from Eriksen and Kane before the break. Mousa Dembele celebrates his goal Kane had scored five goals in his previous three appearances against Eddie Howe's side and there was an inevitability when he made it 3-0 on 48 minutes. Simon Francis' tame challenge allowed Kane to venture into acres of space in the area, and the England striker hammered the ball home from 15 yards out. The game maintained its one-way feel as Spurs took aim at Boruc's goal. The goalkeeper had to deal with eight shots on target in the second-half as Kane, Eriksen and Dele Alli were handed presentable opportunities but were thwarted by the Bournemouth shot-stopper. Harry Kane celebrates with team-mates after scoring a third goal for Tottenham Bournemouth rarely emerged from their own half and their efforts were summed up by Charlie Daniels' speculative effort on 72 minutes, which was their only shot on target. Tottenham even had time to give Kane and Alli a breather in the closing stages as they strolled in the sunshine. One of those replacements, Janssen, notched his first goal from open play for Spurs in stoppage time. Over to you, Chelsea.

It could prove to be an important point for both teams in the battle for survival as relegation rivals Hull City and Swansea lost at Stoke and Watford respectively. Robert Huth's early header and Jamie Vardy's smart finish gave Leicester a two-goal lead but Yohan Cabaye pulled one back and Christian Benteke controversially headed home the equaliser. Christian Benteke celebrates his equaliser against Leicester The result sees Palace move seven points clear and Leicester nine clear of 18th-place Swansea, with both clubs holding a game in hand on Paul Clement's side. The visitors will now turn their attention to a Champions League quarter-final second leg at home to Atletico Madrid on Tuesday. Sam Allardyce said his Palace side were poor defensively but were brilliant on the attack as they drew 2-2 with Leicester Sam Allardyce said his Palace side were poor defensively but were brilliant on the attack as they drew 2-2 with Leicester They had expected another fast Palace start after the Eagles' impressive win over Arsenal but instead took the lead after just six minutes. Palace had won their previous three home matches without conceding but sloppy marking saw them fall behind to Huth's towering header. It was the only effort on goal in a battling first-half display by the Foxes, who made just two changes from their energy-sapping Champions League first-leg defeat in Spain. Sam Allardyce stuck with the same XI that beat Arsenal impressively on Monday and while his side responded well to the early setback, a lack of creativity often let them down in the final third. Benteke dominated the aerial battle and enjoyed particular success against Danny Simpson but Kasper Schmeichel reacted well to keep out the Belgian's best effort of the half. Huth's towering header gave Leicester the early advantage And Leicester extended their advantage through Vardy seven minutes after the break. The England international latched onto Riyad's Mahrez pass and curled home his sixth goal in his last seven league appearances. The fine finish looked set to edge Leicester towards their second away league win of the season but Palace halved the deficit less than two minutes later. There was a touch of fortune about the goal as Jeff Schlupp's cross deflected off Simpson and into the path of Cabaye, who swept past Schmeichel. Huth scored after just six minutes but the visitors were pegged back It galvanised the home support and they were soon on their feet again when Benteke bundled in their leveller. Leicester felt the Palace forward climbed over Yohan Benalouane but referee Mike Dean disagreed, leaving 20 minutes for either side to find a winner. Benteke went closest for Palace but Schmeichel smothered his shot while Leonardo Ulloa and substitute Danny Drinkwater fired wide for the visitors. And a late penalty appeal for the home side was waved away after Patrick van Aanholt's low cross appeared to hit a sliding Huth on the arm. Allardyce's side now face a tough run of fixtures, with a trip to Liverpool followed by the visit of Tottenham. Leicester will look to overturn their 1-0 first-leg deficit against Atletico before resuming Premier League action at Arsenal.

Phil Jagielka scored for the third game in succession to put the hosts ahead in the 49th minute, but Sam Vokes quickly replied from the penalty spot after being brought down by a clumsy challenge from Joel Robles. Ross Barkley, who was at the centre of a controversial article on Friday that led to Everton banning The Sun newspaper, helped make it 2-1 as his shot deflected in off Michael Keane and then Ben Mee for an OG.

Phil Jagielka celebrates scoring the opener Everton did improve later in the half and Heaton pulled off a good save to keep out Holgate's low shot. Kevin Mirallas' free-kick also deflected narrowly wide, but the introduction for Enner Valencia at half-time for Idrissa Gueye helped Everton up the tempo. They took the lead in the 49th minute when Jagielka headed in at the back post, only to be quickly pegged back as Vokes scored from 12 yards after being fouled by Robles as he ran away from goal. Everton, though, managed to build momentum and Mirallas saw a shot saved before striking the post. Sam Vokes celebrates scoring his side's leveller with George Boyd Barkley helped get the breakthrough in the 71st minute as his shot took two deflections and looped past Heaton. The midfielder celebrated by standing on the hoarding in the Gwladys Street End, grabbing the badge on his shirt and saluting the crowd. There were more celebrations shortly afterwards as Lukaku turned Keane and fired past the goalkeeper.

The Potters led at the break thanks to Marko Arnautovic's well-taken early strike, the Austria international's sixth league goal of the season. However, the Tigers deservedly levelled matters six minutes after half-time via Harry Maguire's deflected shot, only for substitute Peter Crouch to head the home team back ahead midway through the second half. Stoke forward Xherdan Shaqiri celebrates his stunning long-range strike And Stoke wrapped up the win when Xherdan Shaqiri scored with a stunning 30-yard effort to move up to ninth in the table, while Hull remain two points clear of the drop zone in 17th as Marco Silva still seeks his first away win since taking over in January. Both teams made two changes after losing last weekend, with Stoke boss Mark Hughes even trying out a new formation as he sought to bring an end to a dreadful run of five games without a league win. Mark Hughes gives his thoughts following Stoke's 3-1 win against Hull Mark Hughes gives his thoughts following Stoke's 3-1 win against Hull And the home side made the dream start by opening the scoring after just six minutes through Arnautovic, who in the process became the highest-scoring Austrian in Premier League history. Shaqiri's crisp pass found Arnautovic racing clear down the left wing, before the forward cut back inside and thumped an unstoppable effort past a helpless Eldin Jakupovic and into the top right-hand corner of the net. Marko Arnautovic scores for Stoke City as Harry Maguire attempts to block his shot However, if Hughes thought that early goal would settle his team down, he was mistaken as the visitors took control of proceedings for the rest of the first half, only to fail to make their domination pay. Oumar Niasse saw one close-range effort saved by Lee Grant, before the Stoke goalkeeper had to be alert to keep out Lazar Markovic's well-struck volley. And from the resulting corner, returning centre-back Maguire somehow blazed over the bar with the goal at his mercy as the Tigers continued to waste chances to get back on level terms. The Potters also had their moments before the break, with the always dangerous Arnautovic going closest to doubling the home side's lead after being picked out by Shaqiri's delicious lofted ball, only to fire over the bar with just Jakupovic to beat. Maguire celebrates his equaliser against Stoke But it was Hull who got the next goal after 51 minutes to draw level, although in truth it was a scruffy effort that had a large element of good fortune about it. Stoke left wing-back Erik Pieters needlessly conceded a corner, which was worked short by Sam Clucas and after a series of ricochets, the ball dropped to the unmarked Maguire at the back stick. However, despite the central defender's shot being driven into the ground, it somehow bobbled past Grant at his near post with the aid of a deflection off Ryan Shawcross. Hughes responded to that setback by bringing on both Walters and Crouch just before the hour mark, and eight minutes later the duo combined to put Stoke in front again as the Irishman's inch-perfect cross was powered home by his strike partner for his 49th headed goal in the Premier League. And despite Grant having to be alert to keep out Kamil Grosicki's low shot with a quarter of an hour left to play, Stoke sealed the points when Shaqiri added to his growing list of stunning long-range left-footed strikes 10 minutes from time.

valiant 2-2 draw with West Ham at the Stadium of Light on Saturday. Wahbi Khazri scored direct from a corner (26) and substitute Fabio Borini netted with his first touch (90) as the hosts cancelled out strikes from Andre Ayew (5) and James Collins (47) for the Hammers. The encouraging performance will do little for Sunderland's survival bid though, with the Wearsiders left needing favours to avoid dropping into the Sky Bet Championship. The draw leaves the Black Cats rooted to the foot of the table, nine points from safety with just six games left to secure their top-flight status. Having seen Sam Byram dismissed for two bookable offences late on, West Ham held on for a point which sees them climb to 13th. David Moyes shuffled his pack following last Sunday's defeat to Manchester United, making four changes, the most notable of which saw Khazri handed his first start since October. Andy Carroll replaced the injured Michail Antonio and deputised for suspended captain Mark Noble, who was replaced in midfield by Edimilson Fernandes. And Carroll had a hand in West Ham's opener, turning Robert Snodgrass' deep cross back for Ayew, who kept his cool to poke the ball past the on-rushing Jordan Pickford., who had already denied a Manuel Lanzini free-kick. West Ham's Andre Ayew celebrates after opening the scoring in the game against Sunderland The Hammers were a yard away from doubling their lead on 21 minutes but, having shaped to pick out the far corner, Snodgrass' effort whistled past Pickford's near post. Byram's shoulder barge on Jermain Defoe went unpunished as Sunderland saw tame penalty appeals ignored by referee Andre Marriner. But their complaints soon turned to cheers as Khazri's corner flew into the back of the net via the post, ending the hosts' 701-minute wait for a league goal in front of their own fans. 2016 - Wahbi Khazri's goal was the first scored direct from a corner in the Premier League since Ben Watson vs Man City in Jan 2016. Whip. — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) April 15, 2017 West Ham should have restored their lead on 36 minutes but Ayew, having nipped ahead of the better-placed Snodgrass, swivelled and fired over from close range. Sunderland responded by seeing out the half the stronger of the two sides, with Khazri drawing Darren Randolph into a save in stoppage-time. The positivity evaporated just two minutes into the second period as, just as they did against Manchester United, the hosts conceded immediately after the restart, Collins glancing Snodgrass' corner home. Sunderland are staring relegation in the face after spirited draw Didier Ndong spurned the best chance of the game to haul the hosts level, but his rash 72nd-minute effort, after fine play from Khazri, typified Sunderland's plight. Things then took a turn for the worse when right-back Billy Jones sustained a serious injury following a collision with Arthur Masuaku and required seven minutes of treatment. 13 - Sunderland have conceded more headed goals than any other Premier League side this season. Bombardment. — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) April 15, 2017 However his replacement, Borini, wasted no time in lightening the mood, punishing Randolph's handling error to drill the hosts level at the end of normal time. The indication of 10 minutes of additional time, plus Byram's dismissal for a second booking, only added to the hosts' hope of staging a dramatic comeback but it failed to materialise as Sunderland were left on the brink of the drop. 4 - Darren Randolph has made more errors leading to goals than any other player in the Premier League this season.

In a low tempo first-half, Watford dominated the early stages and went closest just before the half hour when Lukasz Fabianski tipped Troy Deeney's clip over the bar as the Swans were forced under the cosh. The visitors were undeterred though and continued to press, though they were pegged back minutes before half-time when Capoue robbed Alfie Mawson, before volleying past Fabianski at the second attempt. Walter Mazzarri's Hornets seemed content to grind out the result in the second half and despite a host of attacking-minded changes from Paul Clement, they did just that. Etienne Capoue is pursued by team-mates while celebrating his goal against Swansea. Heurelho Gomes was seldom troubled in the Watford goal and the result does little for Swansea, who remain firmly embroiled in a relegation tussle, two points from safety heading into the final five fixtures of the season. Paul Clement was left without skipper Jack Cork after he sustained an ankle injury against West Ham last weekend; the midfielder's absence one of four Swansea changes. The return of Hornets' top-scorer Troy Deeney was one of three tweaks to the starting eleven by Mazzarri; the striker was left on the bench for their 4-0 defeat to Tottenham, though reports suggesting a rift between the pair were swiftly refuted by the Italian. Swansea manager Paul Clement admits next week's fixture against Stoke is a must-win for his side Swansea manager Paul Clement admits next week's fixture against Stoke is a must-win for his side Though Watford imposed themselves with much of the early possession, neither side could spark the game into life, until Gylfi Sigurdsson forced a point-blank save out of Gomes under pressure from Capoue nine minutes in. Iceland international Sigurdsson soon had another long-range effort held by Gomes, but Swansea's efforts amounted to half-chances and it was Watford, all-but guaranteed Premier League survivors, who went closest just before the half hour; Fabianski leaping like a salmon to keep out Deeney's connection on Janmaat's cross. The spike in action was short-lived though and it was the Swans who continued to press, but with three minutes left in the half, they were architects of their own downfall when Mawson gifted Watford the opener. Etienne Capoue opened the scoring for Watford. Capoue stole the ball from the young defender's feet and - though his first shot was saved - made no mistake the second time around as he volleyed past Fabianski via the post. As had panned out in the first half, the second half began in a sluggish fashion. Sigurdsson went close on 50 minutes when he dropped his shoulder and lost Sebastian Prodl, but his curling effort dropped disappointingly wide. Gylfi Sigurdsson had numerous chances to bring Swansea back into the game Ki Sung-Yeung floated a cross over the bar in a commanding position following a rare flowing passage of play from the visitors, but as the game progressed it transpired that Mazzarri had instructed his men to grind out the narrow win. Given the looming threat of relegation, Clement's men showed little sign of the fighting spirit one would expect; at times they seemed to sense the chance of an equaliser though nothing came to fruition. At the death, skipper for the day Sigurdsson had two chances to earn a precious point for his side, but as he advanced towards the box at the second attempt and beat Adrian Mariappa, Abdoulaye Doucoure intervened with a vital touch to remove the ball from his possession and ensure the three points remained in Hertfordshire.

"report": "2:39 Southampton 0-3 Manchester City Southampton 0-3 Manchester City Vincent Kompany scored his first Premier League goal since August 2015 as Pep Guardiola's side beat Southampton 3-0 to move seven points clear of the chasing pack in the race for Champions League qualification. The 31-year-old, who returned to City's starting line-up to make just his fifth appearance of the season, sent the visitors on their way to victory at St. Mary's in the 56th minute, rising highest to head David Silva's corner past Fraser Forster. The points were then made safe in the 77th minute with Leroy Sane finishing off a swift counter-attacking move before Sergio Aguero (80) completed the scoring on a comfortable afternoon for the visitors. Vincent Kompany celebrates after scoring the opening goal of the game against Southampton Victory moves City up into third ahead of Liverpool, who play West Brom on Super Sunday, and seven points clear of Everton in fifth and Manchester United in sixth, as Jose Mourinho's side host Chelsea on Sunday, live on Sky Sports. Meanwhile, Southampton, who saw a three-game unbeaten run come to an end, stay in ninth. Manolo Gabbiadini returned from injury to start his first match in just under a month, while Kompany's inclusion was the standout news as Guardiola made another four changes to the side that beat Hull last time out. City started on the front foot with Clichy creating an opening for Aguero at the far post but the striker fired an awkward volley wide at the far post. Jesus Navas and Nathan Redmond battle for the ball at St Mary's Aguero was back in the action again minutes later, bringing the ball down in the penalty area before firing a shot wide of the far post. City were dominating the ball with Southampton sitting deep, but they finally showed their attacking intent in the 15th minute when Nathan Redmond's pass released Gabbiadini on the right. The striker pulled the ball back for Tadic on the penalty spot but the Serbia international blazed the ball high over the crossbar. The visitors had a clear chance of their own in the 37th minute when Aguero produced a brilliant change of pace to get to the byline before picking out Silva at the far post, but the Spanish midfielder failed to hit the target with the goal at his mercy. Manolo Gabbiadini and Fernandinho vie for possession A minute later came the talking point of the first half when Leroy Sane strode through on goal before attempting to go around Fraser Forster. Sane went to ground after contact with Forster but the England goalkeeper appeared to get a significant touch on the ball which was spotted by referee Neil Swarbrick. After the break, Forster got a firmer hand onto a stinging drive from Jesus Navas to palm the ball over the crossbar. However, from the resulting corner, swung in by Silva, Kompany got his head to the ball first and Forster was unable to prevent it bouncing into the net. Leroy Sane celebrates adding a second for Manchester City Claudio Bravo, who had failed to stop any of the last seven shots on target he had faced, then caught a header from Maya Yoshida - the first save he had made since January 2. City then promptly wrapped up the win with two goals in three minutes. First, Silva's through-ball sent De Bruyne through and he squared for Sane to sweep past Forster for his ninth of the season. Then, in the 80th minute, De Bruyne chipped the ball into the Saints six-yard box and Aguero nodded home at the far post to seal an ultimately comfortable, and potentially crucial, victory.

Andros Townsend gave Crystal Palace a 1-0 lead with a close-range finish on 17 minutes, despite Arsenal's dominance in possession in the first period. The Gunners were second best after the break, and it was 2-0 just after the hour mark through Yohan Cabaye's looping effort, before Luka Milivojevic put Palace three ahead from the penalty spot after Emiliano Martinez brought down Townsend. Townsend slots home from Wilfried Zaha's cross in the 17th minute The result means Arsene Wenger's side are seven points off fourth-placed Manchester City albeit with a game in hand, while Palace are six points clear of the relegation zone, also with a game in hand. Arsenal have now lost four consecutive Premier League away games for the first time under Wenger, leaving them 20 points off Chelsea at the top and the same distance off Crystal Palace. Both sides were unchanged for the clash after the midweek fixtures, and it was Arsenal who went closest early on, with Mohamed Elneny forcing Wayne Hennessey into a good save from long range. Despite having very little possession in the opening stages, Palace were ahead on 17 minutes through Townsend, who turned home from eight yards after Wilfried Zaha's low delivery into the box. Danny Welbeck paces forward with the ball Hennessey was forced into action again by Alexis Sanchez, whose effort was destined for the bottom corner, before the Chilean struck just wide from the left angle. Palace could have easily been 2-0 up going into the break through Christian Benteke, who caused Arsenal problems throughout the game, but his effort at the near post when one-on-one with Martinez was tipped round the post by the goalkeeper. Benteke then saw a deflected effort on the turn blocked superbly by Hector Bellerin, before the striker had the ball in the net from a rebounded shot, only to be flagged marginally offside. And Palace deservedly went 2-0 up on 63 minutes through Cabaye, whose looping effort from just inside the area found the corner of the net following Zaha's centre. Palace team-mates celebrate Yohan Cabaye's goal in the second half Zaha, enjoying a fine season for Palace, was a menace all night for Arsenal's defenders down the right flank, deservedly picking up the man-of-the-match award. Referee Michael Oliver then awarded Palace a penalty just five minutes later after Martinez came racing out to clean out both Bellerin and Townsend inside the box, leaving Milivojevic to finish well into the bottom left corner from the spot. And Palace nearly made it worse before full-time, but Benteke's volley at the far post was cleared off the line by Nacho Monreal.

Zlatan Ibrahimovic put United 1-0 up on 30 minutes with a fine turn and low shot on the edge of the box, before Larsson was harshly sent off by Craig Pawson for a high tackle on Ander Herrera. Just 45 seconds after the restart, United were 2-0 up through Henrikh Mkhitaryan, who found the bottom left corner from 15 yards with his left foot as Sunderland stood off. Paul Pogba congratulates Henrikh Mkhitaryan after he scored Man Utd's second goal Substitute Marcus Rashford added a third with a minute remaining, finishing well into the bottom corner from inside the area after Ibrahimovic's assist. The result means Sunderland remain bottom of the Premier League, 10 points from safety with seven games remaining, while United are up to fifth, four points off fourth-place Man City but with a game in hand. Jose Mourinho made five changes from midweek, starting Luke Shaw following criticism over the past week. Sergio Romero came in for the injured David de Gea, while Marouane Fellaini was named captain. Sunderland made just one change, with Victor Anichebe replacing Fabio Borini. Ander Herrera is challenged by Jack Rodwell in the first half The first real chance of the game fell to Jesse Lingard, who was awarded with a new contract in midweek, but the Englishman's low effort from the edge of the box was tipped wide by Jordan Pickford. But Pickford could do nothing about the opening goal a minute later when Ibrahimovic's turn and shot from nothing 18 yards out curled into the bottom right-hand corner. Ibrahimovic has now scored 250 goals in 308 appearances since he turned 30 in 2011, having scored 232 before his 30th birthday. Sunderland were nearly level five minutes before the break through Anichebe, but Romero rushed out well to block the striker, who could argue that Eric Bailly's trailing foot shoved him off balance. The hosts were reduced to 10 men just two minutes before the break when Larsson's slightly high foot went through Herrera; referee Pawson did not hesitate in pulling out the red card when a yellow arguably seemed more appropriate. Luke Shaw is greeted by Jose Mourinho after being substituted After the break, United were ahead before Sunderland had managed to touch the ball as Mkhitaryan struck well into the bottom corner, but the Armenian had Lamine Kone to thank for standing off him inside the area. Chances were at a premium after the second goal, though Ibrahimovic did go close to adding a second with a deflected cross-shot, which Pickford reacted well to. Paul Pogba wildly volleyed over the bar from Ibrahimovic's cut-back, before Jermain Defoe fired just over the bar with a well-struck effort from the edge of the box at the other end. Rashford wrapped up the points in the 89th minute, finishing into the bottom left corner from 10 yards out after man-of-the-match Ibrahimovic had teed him up. It ended 3-0, meaning United are still in the hunt for a top four Premier League spot, while Sunderland have now gone 675 minutes without a goal in the top flight.

Five goals were scored in a pulsating first half, starting with Tom Davies' close-range finish for Everton in the first minute, but the hosts were soon pegged back by Islam Slimani's goal as Leicester broke after just four minutes. Marc Albrighton then put Leicester ahead with a direct free-kick from a crossing position on the left, before Lukaku equalised with a close-range header on 23 minutes. Romelu Lukaku's close-range header put Everton back on level terms The frantic first half ended 3-2 when Phil Jagielka's header from a corner found the corner of the net, and 12 minutes after the break Lukaku got his second with a far-post finish through a crowd of players. The result means Everton remain seventh, seven points off the top four, while Leicester are 11th, eight points clear of safety. Everton went ahead after just 30 seconds through Davies, who finished from close range following Kevin Mirallas' direct run through the heart of the Leicester defence, in which referee Bobby Madley played a useful advantage. Joel Robles watches Marc Albrighton's free-kick fly into the top corner to put Leicester ahead But Leicester, who made several changes from the side which beat Sunderland 2-0 ahead of their Champions League quarter-final against Atletico Madrid, replied instantly just three minutes later, Slimani finishing under Joel Robles after Demarai Gray played him through on goal on the counter attack. It was 2-1 to Leicester on 10 minutes as Albrighton's cross-shot from a free-kick found the top corner past Robles, who was anticipating a delivery into the box. Lukaku equalised on 23 minutes, netting in his eighth successive match at Goodison Park, finishing with a close-range header from Ross Barkley's sumptuous right-wing cross. Tom Davies celebrates his goal in the first minute against Leicester Barkley himself should have had Everton 3-2 up, taking the ball around Schmeichel before the Leicester goalkeeper somehow got a last-ditch glove on it before the midfielder could convert into the empty net. But from the resulting corner Everton took the lead again, as Mirallas' superb delivery was headed into the top corner by Jagielka from six yards. In contrast to the first 45 minutes, the second half began slower, but Everton gained a two-goal cushion via Lukaku's second, finishing up at the back post via Mirallas' corner and some questionable Leicester defending. Leicester nearly halved the deficit with 11 minutes remaining, but Leonardo Ulloa's header from a Riyad Mahrez corner was blocked by the face of Idrissa Gueye at point-blank range. Phil Jagielka celebrates scoring Everton's third goal And again the champions were close to creating a nervous last few minutes after Ulloa's glancing header from another Mahrez cross was superbly saved by Robles. But it finished 4-2, ending Craig Shakespeare's 100 per cent start as Leicester manager, while Ronald Koeman's Everton remain firmly in the hunt for the top six places.

Dele Alli opened the scoring in the 33rd minute with a superb long-range effort, and the goal was quickly followed up by strikes from Eric Dier and Heung-Min Son before half-time. Son volleyed in the fourth early in the second half and Spurs cruised to victory with Harry Kane hitting the bar from a late free-kick after playing the final 30 minutes on his return from injury. The win, which cut the gap to Chelsea until the Blues beat later Bournemouth to preserve their seven-point lead - is their 11th in a row at home in the Premier League and sixth on the spin in the league. Dele Alli celebrates scoring for Tottenham They did it without top scorer Kane in the starting XI, as he returned from a one-month absence on the bench, but goalkeeper Hugo Lloris did start after missing a game through illness. Injury-hit Watford made several changes from their midweek win over West Brom, with Troy Deeney a substitute and Daryl Janmaat and Adrian Mariappa starting in a second-string defence. But despite their absences, Watford made a positive enough start, even if Spurs did go close as Son's deflected shot hit the post and Vincent Janssen saw an effort well saved. Eric Dier scored Spurs' second goal After M'Baye Niang shot at Lloris and Craig Cathcart dragged an effort into the side-netting, Janssen should have put Spurs ahead when he turned a cross on to the crossbar from close range. Christian Eriksen then fired over as Spurs started to turn up the pressure. The opener arrived in some style in the 33rd minute, with Alli cutting in from the left and firing a superb shot into the far corner. Alli celebrates scoring Tottenham's opener Dier doubled the advantage shortly afterwards, finishing from just inside the area after Son's cross was blocked. Watford looked deflated after the quickfire double and they fell further behind before half-time as Son fired into the bottom corner from outside the box. Son then made it 4-0 in the 55th minute, finishing on the volley at the back post from Trippier's cross. Watford's Stefano Okaka controls the ball Kane was introduced on the hour mark in place of Janssen and went close to scoring when he took the ball round Heurelho Gomes but could not finish from a tight angle. Deeney also nearly netted after coming off the Watford bench, only to fire over the bar from a good position in the box. Kane nearly connected with a cross from Trippier before setting up a one-on-one chance for Son that he fired wide. Son missed another opportunity for his hat-trick when he shot against the bar, before Kane smacked the woodwork from a free-kick as Spurs eased to victory.

The midfielder, making his second league start of the campaign, fired an unstoppable shot past Eldin Jakupovic to seal victory for City in the second half at the Etihad. They had earlier taken the lead through Ahmed Elmohamady's own goal, the Hull defender turning into his own net after 31 minutes. Fabian Delph drills home Manchester City's third goal at the Etihad Sergio Aguero doubled their advantage shortly after half-time and Delph blasted home their third on 64 minutes before a mistake by Claudio Bravo allowed Andrea Ranocchia to score a late consolation. The result keeps Man City in fourth and extends their lead over Arsenal and Manchester United to seven points, although both clubs hold two games in hand on Pep Guardiola's side. United travel to Sunderland on Super Sunday, while Arsenal visit Crystal Palace on Monday Night Football. As for Hull, they remain two points above the relegation zone after 18th-place Swansea lost 1-0 at West Ham on Saturday. Guardiola made four changes from the 2-1 defeat at Chelsea but retained Delph after praising his performance at Stamford Bridge. His opposite number Marco Silva handed Michael Dawson his first league start since February in place of the injured Harry Maguire, while Evandro came in for Abel Hernandez. His Tigers were on the back foot almost immediately and had Jakupovic to thank for a fine double save after just four minutes. The Hull stopper initially denied David Silva on his 300th Man City appearance before reacting quickly to keep out Leroy Sane's follow-up effort. Aguero went close from distance as did Yaya Toure with a curling free-kick before Man City made their possession count. Manchester City celebrate their opening goal against Hull Jesus Navas' fine attacking display was rewarded when the Spaniard's cross was turned into his own goal by the hapless Elmohamady. It was Hull's fifth own goal of the season but the visitors responded well and had the chance to reply immediately through Oumar Niasse. The striker found himself unmarked in front of goal but miscued wide following good work by the lively Kamil Grosicki. That missed opportunity proved costly as City swiftly extended their lead after the break. Sterling, who was excellent throughout, teed up Aguero and the Argentine made no mistake, netting his 10th goal in his last 10 appearances. Sergio Aguero scored his 10th goal in as many appearances Man City's third also came courtesy of a Sterling assist but owed more to the quality of Delph's strike. The midfielder received a pass 25 yards from goal and unleashed a fierce drive into the far corner. Hull pulled one back through Ranocchia with five minutes to play as the Italian's first-time finish squirmed past Bravo. Having had little to do for much of the match it was an inauspicious finish to the game for the Chilean, who was preferred to Willy Caballero. In the end it mattered little to the result, which puts the onus back on Arsenal and Man Utd in the race for Champions League qualification.

Despite a spirited start on a scorching day on Teeside, Steve Agnew's men failed to find a way through the sturdy Burnley backline and kickstart what was already looking like a doomed survival attempt. Boro's last league win was on December 17 but though the early balls that found Rudy Gestede seems promising, they almost went behind inside 15 minutes when Robbie Brady's free-kick skimmed the top of the bar. Neither side had an attempt on target in the first half, and the second period saw the best of the chances for both sides; Brady swept wide following flowing build-up play, while Alvaro Negredo came off the bench to see an overhead kick expertly kept out by Tom Heaton. The breakthrough never came, leaving Boro six points from safety with seven games to play. Burnley, meanwhile, all-but secured their top-flight berth for another year. Agnew made four changes to the side that lost to Hull on Wednesday evening, Negredo dropping to the bench, while Steven Defour missed out through injury for the Clarets. Despite their comfortable return to the Premier League this season, Burnley arrived on Teeside as one of only two teams in the top four divisions yet to win an away game this season - the other being relegated Championship side Rotherham. Ashley Barnes of Burnley tussles with Adam Clayton It was relatively laboured start from both sides at the Riverside but Boro who emerged as the favourites to draw blood first. Stewart Downing aimed a cross at Antonio Barragan, though the winger ducked out under the challenge of Ben Mee at the vital moment. It became clear that forward balls into the path of Gestede would be the favoured tactic, and though numerous deliveries from Adam Forshaw, Adam Clayton and Barragan breached Burnley's defensive lines, each lacked accuracy. Stewart Downing of Middlesbrough and Matthew Lowton battle for possession Brady's first goal for Sean Dyche's men was a stunning free-kick against Chelsea in February and he was mere inches away from repeating that feat after 15 minutes. Victor Valdes was at full-stretch to try and tip the ball away, but it was the top of the crossbar that spared his blushes, however. His side had the next opportunity when George Boyd intercepted a cross from Lowton, turned and released a shot. The winger perhaps had too little time to aim his shot correctly as he sliced wide ten yards from goal. Boro had dominated the first half, but they, nor their opponents, had registered an attempt on target in the first half. That all changed after the break. It was a cagey start once again, but on 57 minutes Brady spurned what was probably Burnley's best chance of the game. Stephen Ward's cross was dummied by Ashley Barnes, leaving Brady the task of sweeping home the loose ball, but he watched as it curled wide of the mark. Just 10 minutes later, Negredo met Downing's cross with a superb overhead kick; stunning delivery, stunning execution but, unfortunately for Middlesbrough, a superb save from Heaton. Still Boro came forward and they were denied what could have been a season-defining decision five minutes from time; the tenacious former Burnley loanee Patrick Bamford latched onto a long ball out of defence but was felled by Michael Keane on his way. Martin Atkinson booked the defender, his tame decision swayed by the fact he had slipped as he geared up to make the challenge. But they received no such luck and had to settle for a stalemate in the spring sunshine. Boro's winless run stretches to 14 and the threat of relegation is now all-too close.

Everton fan Jon Walters gave Stoke the lead on 44 minutes with an unmarked close-range header, before substitute Coutinho drove home from just inside the area with 20 minutes remaining. And two minutes later Liverpool were ahead as Firmino's superb half-volley flew into the roof of the net from the edge of the box as the visitors broke. The result means Liverpool stay third, nine points ahead of fifth-place Arsenal, who have three games in hand. Stoke are 13th, eight points off the drop zone. Jurgen Klopp was forced to start youngsters Ben Woodburn and Trent Alexander-Arnold at the Bet365 Stadium, with Coutinho and Firmino both on the bench following illness and a groin problem respectively. Liverpool's Roberto Firmino celebrates scoring the winner It was a first half to forget for Klopp as Liverpool struggled to get into the game, though Stoke also struggled to create many clear-cut chances. The first chance fell to Stoke after Dejan Lovren made a hash of a clearance on the stretch, but Marko Arnautovic could only volley into the side-netting at an angle 10 yards out. Before Stoke took the lead with a minute of the first half remaining, Mike Dean waved play on as Woodburn, Liverpool's third-youngest starter in Premier League history, went down under pressure from Erik Pieters, though a penalty award would have been soft. Trent Alexander-Arnold looks to move forward with the ball Stoke went up the other end through Xherdan Shaqiri on the right, and his cross at the byline found the unmarked Walters to head past Simon Mignolet from six yards after Lovren and Joel Matip went missing. The goal was Walters' seventh against Liverpool in the Premier League. Both Woodburn and Alexander-Arnold were replaced at half-time by Brazilians Coutinho and Firmino, but Stoke should have been 2-0 up after Gini Wijnaldum's misjudged header fell to Charlie Adam, whose close-range effort was superbly touched wide by Mignolet. The chances then flooded Liverpool's way around the hour mark; first, Firmino's shot into the ground was tipped wide by Lee Grant, before Coutinho's low, controlled effort from the edge forced Grant into another good save. Xherdan Shaqiri battles with James Milner Lovren then got up highest from a Coutinho corner, but his header came off the top of the crossbar and clear. Liverpool were finally level with 20 minutes remaining through Coutinho, whose controlled effort into the bottom left corner came after Glenn Whelan's poor clearance inside the area. Just two minutes later Liverpool had completed their comeback, as Wijnaldum's lofted ball from deep found Firmino, who went early with the shot and half-volleyed superbly into the back of the net from 20 yards. Stoke were nearly level seconds later through Saido Berahino, but Mignolet somehow kept out his effort with his thigh from point-blank range after Arnautovic's teasing cross. Liverpool fought to see the game out, handing them their first away win in 2017.

Clasie, who came into the side in place of the injured Steven Davis, made the most of a rare start in midfield by firing the Saints in front midway through the first half after superb hold up play from Dusan Tadic. Southampton came close to doubling their lead after the break when Tadic curled an ambitious effort narrowly wide of the mark. West Brom pushed hard for an equaliser but were denied on a number of occasions by Fraser Forster, who made a series of key saves in the dying moments to secure the Saints all three points. Jordy Clasie celebrates after opening his Premier League account with Southampton Southampton's front four of Shane Long, James Ward-Prowse, Nathan Redmond and Tadic combined well in the opening stages but it was the hosts who had the first real chance of the match when James Morrison stung the palms of Forster with a well-struck drive from long-range. And for all of Southampton's intricate play in and around the West Brom box, their opener came from a long punt downfield from the England international goalkeeper. West Brom failed to deal with the ball, allowing Tadic to eventually feed Clasie at the edge of the box. The Dutchman made no mistake with his first-time finish - firing past Ben Foster to grab his first Premier League goal after 37 appearances for the Saints. Salomon Rondon and Maya Yoshida compete for the ball at the Hawthorns Claude Puel's side were boosted by the opener and could have doubled their lead shortly afterwards but Long slipped at the vital moment when clean through on goal. West Brom were creating as many chances at the other end and came close to an equaliser when Forster dived to keep out Salomon Rondon's goal bound header. The match continued in the same vein after the break with Southampton dominating possession but with the Baggies carrying a real threat on the break. Tadic curled a speculative shot just inches over the bar shortly before substitute Hal Robson-Kanu blasted a close-range effort off target under pressure from the onrushing Forster. Nathan Redmond takes the ball past Nacer Chadli as Southampton claimed victory away from home With time running out, West Brom continued to push men forward and were almost rewarded in the closing stages when Dawson fired a volley towards goal - only to see his shot saved by Forster with Allan Nyom unable to convert the resulting rebound. Jonny Evans had one last chance to salvage a draw for the hosts but his tame close-range effort was punched to safety by Forster in the fifth and final minute of injury time as Claude Puel's side held out for a hard-fought victory.

The Senegal international scored a brilliant long-range effort just before half-time to bring to an end a dreadful recent run of five straight Premier League defeats. As a result, the Hammers have moved up to 14th in the table, eight points from the drop zone, while Swansea - who were toothless in attack all afternoon - remain two points from safety after a fifth away defeat in a row. West Ham had Michail Antonio available after the forward was forced off against Arsenal due to illness. However, Andy Carroll was only fit enough for a place on the bench after also having to be substituted early in their midweek loss at the Emirates, with Robert Snodgrass replacing the striker in the Hammers' only change. The home side, though, were still without the likes of first-team regulars Aaron Cresswell, Winston Reid, Angelo Ogbonna and Pedro Obiang due to injury. Meanwhile, Swansea had top scorer Fernando Llorente back on the substitutes' bench after recovering from a recent ankle problem, and right-back Kyle Naughton was passed fit to play after injuring his hamstring in Wednesday's 3-1 loss to Tottenham Hotspur. And the visitors - who were unchanged from midweek - were also boosted by the news that No 1 Lukasz Fabianski, who took a heavy knock in that defeat, could start in goal. Not surprisingly, with so much at stake in the game, both sides made a cagey start to proceedings in the sunshine with neither 'keeper tested in the opening quarter of an hour. Wayne Routledge (left) is put under pressure by Arthur Masuaku of West Ham Gradually, though, the Hammers grew in confidence and came close to opening the scoring after 20 minutes. However, after Antonio had done well to work some space in the box and swing a cross to the far post, Fabianski was alert on his goal-line to keep out Snodgrass' close-range header. The Poland international then had to be equally agile to keep out Andre Ayew's well-struck shot on the half-hour mark as West Ham started to increase the pressure on their opponents. And that pressure did finally tell in the last minute of the half as West Ham broke the deadlock thanks to Kouyate's first Premier League goal of the season, and what a strike it was too. The midfielder played a neat one-two with Snodgrass, before collecting his return pass, striding forward and thumping an unstoppable 25-yard effort past a helpless Fabianski. Swansea manager Paul Clement reacted to that setback by bringing on both Luciano Narsingh and Llorente at the break to beef up the visitors' attacking options, but to little effect. If there was any team, though, who looked like scoring in the second half, then it was West Ham, who shook off the loss of key forward Antonio to a hamstring injury five minutes before the break to test Fabianski on several occasions. However, the Swans' keeper was at his agile best to twice deny Ayew late on as West Ham recorded just a second home win in the league in their last seven games.

Tottenham had seen off Watford 4-0 earlier in the day to cut the gap to four, but Antonio Conte's men sealed three points at the Vitality Stadium to maintain their push for a fifth league title. Adam Smith gave Chelsea the advantage in the 17th minute as he turned the ball into his own net from a Diego Costa shot, before Eden Hazard superbly slotted home the second not long after. Josh King netted his tenth goal in 11 Premier League games to pull a goal back for the Cherries just before half-time, but Marcos Alonso sealed the three points for the Blues with a sublime free-kick in the 68th minute. Bournemouth, who are seven points ahead of the relegation places, made one change from the midweek draw with Liverpool while Conte welcomed Victor Moses and Nemanja Matic back into the starting XI. Eden Hazard celebrates with team-mate Diego Costa It was an even start, but Chelsea took the advantage in the 17th minute. A ball forward from David Luiz picked out Moses on the right and his cross reached Diego Costa, who sliced his attempted shot. But it nestled into the back of the net after being diverted goalwards by the body of Smith. Just three minutes later, the Blues added another. N'Golo Kante, with his first Premier League assist for the club, picked out Hazard on the left and he danced towards the box, swerving around the oncoming Artur Boruc to coolly slot home. Bournemouth could have pulled a goal back after half an hour as Charlie Daniels fired into the box a ball that found Benik Afobe on the right. The striker hit a fine volley, but it could only rattle the crossbar and nick the foot of Thibaut Courtois before going wide. Marcos Alonso celebrates scoring Chelsea's third goal from a free-kick While Chelsea kept pressing for another goal - Moses just heading wide in the 38th minute - the hosts did pull a goal back with three minutes of normal time to play. Afobe found King on the right and the in-form forward curled home although the ball did take a nick off the thigh of Luiz on the way through. It could have been all square on the 45-minute mark as King and Afobe linked up one again, but Cesar Azpilicueta got a vital flick onto a cross from the former to see the ball evade the head of the waiting Afobe and go wide. 1 - N'Golo Kanté has provided his first ever Premier League assist for Chelsea in what is his 30th appearance. Slide. — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) April 8, 2017 The second period was a quieter affair although the attacking intent was still there from both sides, with the first real chance of the half coming after 57 minute. Costa found Alonso on the left and the wing-back took one touch before passing back into the box for his team-mate. But he could not get a toe to the cross to poke home and the home defence cleared. Chelsea added their third of the game 11 minutes later. Costa was fouled at the top of the box by Steve Cook to win a Blues free-kick, which Alonso and Luiz lined up behind. It was the wing-back who stepped up and curled a brilliant free-kick over the wall and into the top corner with Boruc only able to watch it on its way through. It could have been a quick second for Alonso, but he skewed a header just wide at the back post from a Hazard cross before Boruc made a brilliant save to deny Moses a Chelsea fourth. Hazard scores his side's second goal of the game at the Vitality Stadium Substitute Issy Mousset could have made things interesting on the 90-minute mark when a Daniels cross found him in the box, but Gary Cahill was able to nick the ball out of play before he could shoot and Chelsea saw out the victory to end Bournemouth's run of five Premier League games unbeaten.

Ozil gave Arsenal the lead on 58 minutes with a left-footed shot from the edge of the area, though Darren Randolph should have done better in the West Ham goal. It was 2-0 just 10 minutes later through Walcott, who struck home from 10 yards after Ozil's centre from a fine Arsenal move. The third came seven minutes from time through Giroud, who curled a fine effort into the corner from 15 yards just nine minutes after coming on. The result means Arsenal are back in the top five on goal difference, while West Ham are five points off the drop zone. Michail Antonio in action against Arsenal Arsenal were forced to start third-choice goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez due to injuries to David Ospina and Petr Cech, and also introduced Gabriel and Mohamed Elneny. West Ham had the better of the early chances, as Manuel Lanzini struck just over from a free-kick, before Mark Noble missed the far post with a low effort from inside the area. Arsenal had a strong penalty appeal turned down by Martin Atkinson after Theo Walcott was hauled down by Arthur Masuaku. Sam Byram puts pressure on Alexis Sanchez The hosts nearly went into the half 1-0 up, but both Hector Bellerin and Elneny saw their efforts from close range desperately blocked. Arsenal upped the tempo in the second half, and got their opener through Ozil's tame effort from the edge of the box, which Randolph parried into the net. Randloph kept West Ham in the game for a few more minutes at least with a good low save from Danny Welbeck's poked effort in the area, but he couldn't keep out Walcott on 68 minutes.

Alvaro Negredo gave Middlesbrough a surprise advantage in the fifth minute, but goals from Lazar Markovic, Oumar Niasse and Abel Hernandez in the first half gave Hull a convincing lead. Marten de Roon scored from an offside position to make the score 3-2 on the stroke of half-time, but defender Harry Maguire sealed the win for Hull in the second half. Swansea lost 3-1 to Tottenham, meaning the Tigers are now two points clear of the drop in 17th. Meanwhile, Middlesbrough's position looks even more perilous as they remain 19th, seven points away from safety. Marco Silva made one change to his Hull side that beat West Ham on Saturday, with Kamil Grosicki coming in for Curtis Davies. Meanwhile, Boro boss Steve Agnew elected to start Rudy Gestede up front with Negredo. Daniel Ayala and James Husband replaced Bernardo and the injured Fabio in the backline. Hull began the game on the front foot with a disallowed goal in the fourth minute. Markovic was played through on goal by Ahmed Elmohamady, but the former Liverpool forward decided to square the ball to Niasse, who tapped in but was half a yard offside. Alvaro Negredo (R) gave Boro a surprise lead Surprisingly, it was Boro who took the lead moments later. Negredo played an excellent lofted through ball to Traore on the right flank. He cut in and had a wayward shot, only for the Spaniard to slide in and tapped the ball in for his eighth goal of the season. Hull would find a deserved equaliser in the 13th minute. A whipped in cross by Andrew Robertson was deflected into the path of Ben Gibson, who made a mess of his clearance, allowing Markovic to score his first goal for the club. As the game became increasingly scrappy, Hull would go on to take the lead. Alfred N'Diaye flicked the ball over his head, and Hernandez flicked it on into the path of Niasse, who tucked his effort into the bottom-left corner. Middlesbrough would come close to grabbing a consolation through Gestede, as his header was tipped over the bar by Eldin Jakupovic. Negredo then had an effort which he curled just wide of the left post. On the stroke of half-time, Boro made it 3-2 through de Roon. A Boro corner was met by Gibson, whose header was nodded on into the net by De Roon. He was standing around two yards offside, but the linesman overruled referee Michael Oliver to award the goal. Hull began the second half on the front foot, with Victor Valdes called into action again to parry out a low shot from N'Diaye in the 59th minute. Harry Maguire scored Hull's fourth goal to seal a crucial win over Middlesbrough But 10 minutes later, Hull took a 4-2 lead. Robertson played in a curled free-kick from the left flank for Maguire to reach at the back post. He directed his header into the far corner to kill off any chance of a Boro fightback. With both teams clearly tiring in the second half, and the removal of Negredo in the 70th minute, Boro struggled to create any clear-cut chances as Hull did well to see the game out by keeping hold of the ball for long spells.

Wednesday night. The visitors took a 31st-minute lead through Christian Benteke's fifth goal in his last five Premier League games against the Saints. However, Southampton responded with strikes from Nathan Redmond just before half-time, and Maya Yoshida and James Ward-Prowse in the final four minutes of the game. As a result, Claude Puel's side have eased any relegation fears they may have had leading up to the game, but the Eagles are just three points clear of the drop zone and still deep in trouble. Southampton were without left-back Ryan Bertrand and striker Manolo Gabbiadini, while the Italian's possible replacement in attack, Sofiane Boufal, was also out. The Eagles, meanwhile, were unable to call upon the services of Scott Dann after the experienced central defender sustained knee ligament damage in Saturday's win at Chelsea. Nathan Redmond (right) celebrates his equaliser for Southampton The visitors were missing the injured trio of James Tomkins, Patrick van Aanholt and Loic Remy as well for the trip to the South Coast. Holding midfielder Luka Milivojevic almost opened the scoring with a 13th-minute free-kick that beat the wall and Fraser Forster in Southampton's goal, only to strike the outside of the post. However, in an end-to-end affair, the home side then went desperately close to making the breakthrough via unlikely means as Redmond rose high at the far post to meet Cedric's right-wing cross with a firm header, but Wayne Hennessey did well to claw his effort round the post. Ten minutes later, the Eagles took the lead through a lovely team goal involving first Jeff Schlupp and Wilfried Zaha down the left flank, before the ball was worked to the opposite wing via Jason Puncheon and Andros Townsend. Oriol Romeu and Wilfried Zaha battle for possession at St Mary's The England international then drilled across the six-yard box an inviting centre from which Benteke could not miss as the striker scored his third goal of the season against the Saints. Southampton levelled matters in controversial circumstances in the final minute of the half as James Ward-Prowse chased down a lost cause near the right touchline, before appearing to barge Zaha over. Referee Roger East saw nothing wrong with the challenge, though, allowing the Saints midfielder to swing a cross towards Redmond at the back post and the winger found the back of the net with a scuffed effort. Both teams had chances to retake the lead after the break, with Martin Kelly striking the post for Palace, while Shane Long spurned two wonderful openings for Southampton after being played clean through on goal. However, as the Saints continued to push forward, eventually their late pressure told as Redmond got free to the left byline and after Jack Stephens had flicked the ball on, his central-defensive partner Yoshida tapped home at the far post. The game was then over as a contest 60 seconds later as Dusan Tadic sent Cedric scampering down the right flank and the Portuguese's inch-perfect cross was tucked home by the waiting Ward-Prowse six yards out.

Mauricio Pochettino's men were two minutes plus stoppage-time away from falling adrift of leaders Chelsea after Wayne Routledge's 11th-minute opener. But Dele Alli drew Spurs level in the 88th minute before Heung-Min Son put the visitors in front in the first of seven additional minutes. Christian Eriksen then struck the visitors' third three minutes later to seal the vital victory that keeps Spurs second in the Premier League, seven points off top spot. A third league defeat in their last four outings, meanwhile, sees Swansea drop into the relegation zone. Heung-Min Son strikes late in the game to give Tottenham a 2-1 lead Hugo Lloris was taken ill ahead of kick-off, handing Michel Vorm the chance to start against his former club. However, despite their captain's absence, Spurs flew out of the traps and could have taken a first-minute lead had the returning Son not seen his shot blocked. Spurs' early dominance was replaced by a frenetic period, which ended with Swansea breaking the deadlock. Having comfortably dealt with three corners in quick succession, a long ball from Lukasz Fabianski released Jordan Ayew in behind the Spurs defence. 1 – Wayne Routledge has scored his first PL goal at the Liberty Stadium since Dec 2014, ending a run of 33 apps there without one. Relief. — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) April 5, 2017 His great footwork baffled former Swans defender Ben Davies, creating a yard to cross for Routledge who converted from close range. Alli's individual brilliance almost hauled Spurs level within five minutes, but having juggled the ball in the Swansea area, his audacious over-head kick whistled over the target. Spurs struggled to break down Swansea's well-drilled defensive unit, but when they did manage to penetrate, their accuracy let them down, Son blazing Davies' cutback over on 42 minutes. Leroy Fer clears the ball during the Premier League match against Tottenham Hotspur The second half began with both sides seeing penalty appeals declined, with referee Jon Moss choosing not to penalise Toby Alderweireld's challenge on Ayew and Federico Fernandez's alleged handball. Kyle Naughton almost followed in Routledge's footsteps by scoring against his former club, but his 56th-minute strike deflected just wide. Despite their dominance, chances were at a premium for Spurs and it took the introduction of Vincent Janssen on the hour, who encouraged a more direct approach, to inspire their revival. The Dutchman forced a fine save from Fabianski on 80 minutes, before Alli's goal-bound header five minutes later was parried away by the inspired Pole. But his defences were breached three minutes later when Alli reacted quickest to turn Eriksen's deflected shot home from close range, Christian Eriksen celebrates after his injury-time goal gives Tottenham a 3-1 lead The announcement of seven additional minutes only helped Spurs' cause - and it took just one for them to take the lead, Janssen's neat flick releasing Son who converted past Fabianski.

A mistake by Willy Caballero allowed Hazard to open the scoring on 10 minutes before Thibaut Courtois' error led to a swift equaliser for Sergio Aguero. Chelsea went back ahead thanks to Hazard, who converted the rebound after Caballero saved his spot-kick following Fernandinho's trip on Pedro. Eden Hazard and Gael Clichy battle for possession Courtois denied Aguero and John Stones miscued over the crossbar in stoppage time as City pushed for a leveller but ultimately came up short. The victory sees Chelsea take a big step towards the Premier League title but Tottenham's late comeback at Swansea ensures their lead at the summit remains seven points. Defeat for City means they miss the chance to move into third place and instead stay four points clear of Arsenal and Manchester United in fifth and sixth respectively. It also means Chelsea become the first team to do the league double over Pep Guardiola in a single season in his managerial career. The City boss sprang two surprises as Vincent Kompany made his first appearance since January and Fabian Delph was handed his first league start of the campaign. Antonio Conte made just one change from Chelsea's shock home defeat to Crystal Palace, bringing in Kurt Zouma for Nemanja Matic, and the hosts made the perfect start. It came courtesy of poor goalkeeping from Caballero, who failed to react when Hazard's low strike deflected off Kompany. But the visitors responded well and Aguero levelled midway through the half. A poor clearance by Courtois put Chelsea under pressure and when the goalkeeper kept out David Silva's initial effort, Aguero was on hand to turn home. Chelsea celebrate Hazard's second at Stamford Bridge It was a deserved equaliser for City, who also went close through Leroy Sane before Hazard grabbed a second 10 minutes before half-time. Fernandinho had no complaints when he tripped Pedro in the box, with Caballero's save giving the fortunate Hazard a second chance to spare his blushes. The second half followed a similar pattern as City enjoyed the majority of possession but struggled to break down a stubborn Chelsea rear-guard, bolstered by the half-time introduction of Matic. Kompany struck the crossbar with a looping header and Fernandinho blazed over on the volley but Chelsea looked comfortable until the final stages. They could have wrapped up the win earlier had Hazard not squandered a golden opportunity for his hat-trick with 15 minutes remaining. Hazard is mobbed by team-mates after scoring Chelsea's opening goal against Manchester City Instead, Raheem Sterling and Nolito entered the fray and Guardiola's reinforcements made a difference as City wasted two guilt-edged chances in added time. Courtois saved smartly from Aguero at the back post and Stones contrived to slice over from the resulting corner as Stamford Bridge breathed a sigh of relief. They continue their quest for a second title in three years at Bournemouth on Saturday, while Man City host Hull City.

Benik Afobe put the Cherries ahead in the seventh minute when he capitalised on a slack backpass from Georginio Wijnaldum to finish past Simon Mignolet. But Philippe Coutinho levelled before the break and Divock Origi headed the Reds in front in the 59th minute. That looked like it would be enough for Jurgen Klopp's side until King finished in the 87th minute to earn the Cherries a point. The draw is yet another setback for Liverpool this season against a team in the bottom half of the table, and leaves them third in the Premier League, two points ahead of Manchester City, who have a game in hand. On a night when City were beaten by Chelsea, it was an opportunity for Liverpool to strengthen their place in the top four. But, missing Sadio Mane through injury and with Joel Matip on the bench due to a back issue, they dropped points for the second time this season against the Cherries, who came from 3-1 down to win 4-3 in the reverse fixture. Problem for @Lfc is Lovren & Matip always missing games, need to be tougher. 3rd choice Klavan then has to play more & eventually it shows. — Jamie Carragher (@Carra23) April 5, 2017 Another shock looked on the cards as Afobe capitalised on a slack backpass from Wijnaldum to put the visitors ahead in the seventh minute. Liverpool struggled to muster a response and their best opportunity to equalise came from a corner that was flicked on and volleyed wide at the back post by Origi. Marc Pugh spurned a similar chance from a corner at the other end as he fired across goal on the volley from six yards out. Philippe Coutinho celebrates after scoring Liverpool's equaliser The hosts continued to lack a cutting edge and were almost caught out by a long ball over the top that King latched onto before firing a shot over the bar. However, Coutinho levelled before half-time, collecting Roberto Firmino's pass in his stride and then keeping his balance to finish past Artur Boruc. Philippe Coutinho has scored his 29th PL goal and is now the joint highest scoring Brazilian in competition history (level with Juninho) #PL — Sky Sports Statto (@SkySportsStatto) April 5, 2017 Liverpool upped the tempo after the break and went close when Nathaniel Clyne cut in from the right and saw a well-struck shot tipped onto the bar by Boruc. They took the lead after 59 minutes as Wijnaldum turned cleverly in the box and put in a cross for Origi to head home from close range. That looked like it would be enough for Liverpool as they appeared comfortable and kept Bournemouth pressed back inside their own half. Divock Origi celebrates after his goal gives Liverpool a 2-1 lead But the Reds' failure to extend their advantage proved costly as King fired in an equaliser with three minutes remaining after Harry Arter's shot fell to him 10 yards out. Liverpool pressed for a late winner but Klavan headed the best chance at Boruc.

The midfielder guided home Jeff Hendrick's left-wing cross after 58 minutes for his first goal since finding the net against Bournemouth back in December. As a result, the Clarets have now moved up to 12th in the table on 35 points, eight clear of safety, while Stoke have dropped a place to 11th after a record-equalling fifth straight away game without a goal in the Premier League. Burnley boss Sean Dyche made two changes from the team that lost 2-0 at home to Spurs on Saturday, with Belgian midfielder Steven Defour and Sam Vokes both recalled in place of Scott Arfield and Ashley Barnes. Joey Barton, Thomas Heaton and George Boyd embrace each other after Burnley beat Stoke Meanwhile, Stoke - who switched to three at the back - made four alterations following their weekend defeat at Leicester City, with the likes of Marc Muniesa, Mame Biram Diouf, Geoff Cameron and Charlie Adam all starting. Striker Peter Crouch was only fit enough for a place on the subs' bench due to a knee problem, while neither Phil Bardsley or Xherdan Shaqiri made the visitors' squad. The first half was a cagey affair and generally one to forget, with both sides seemingly content to get numbers behind the ball and wait for a mistake from their opponent, which never came. Barton (left) and Charlie Adam battle for possession in the first half The Clarets, without a win for two months, threatened from set plays, without ever really testing Lee Grant in the visitors' goal, while Stoke showed more attacking intent as they looked to end their own poor recent run of no wins in their last three matches. The closest Stoke came to breaking the deadlock before the break, however, was when Adam met Marko Arnautovic's left-wing corner with a firm header, but it was straight at Tom Heaton. The Austrian also wasted a couple of half openings after being played through on goal, only for heavy touches to see the chances go begging, although things did improve after the interval. Just before the hour-mark, Burnley did make the crucial breakthrough after brilliant footwork down the left by record signing Hendrick, who dribbled his way past three Stoke players before picking out Boyd, with the winger then beating Lee Grant with a composed finish. Thereafter, the home side held out relatively comfortably for a vital three points as the Potters' away-day misery continued, with Mark Hughes's team having now lost seven of their last nine league matches on the road.

Sunderland 2-0 on Tuesday. Slimani's header from fellow substitute Marc Albrighton's cross put the champions ahead on 69 minutes, just moments after both had been introduced in the second half. Sub Albrighton repeated the act with 12 minutes remaining, setting up Vardy for a trademark finish inside the area just moments after Victor Anichebe had hit the post with a deflected effort. The result means bottom side Sunderland are eight points off 17th-place Swansea, while Leicester are now 10th as Craig Shakespeare preserved his 100 per cent record since taking over from Claudio Ranieri. Leicester were unchanged after the 2-0 win over Stoke at the weekend, while Lee Cattermole, Seb Larsson and Didier Ndong started for Sunderland. In a first half lacking in real opportunities, Jordan Pickford was called upon twice in the Sunderland goal, first tipping over Robert Huth's header at the far post. Marc Albrighton and Jamie Vardy celebrate Then, with the half drawing to a close, Pickford pulled off a superb fingertip save from Demarai Gray's long-range effort, which was heading for the corner of the goal. The second half started off much like the first, without many chances for either side, before substitute Slimani put Leicester deservedly ahead on 69 minutes. The striker, introduced just seven minutes before alongside Albrighton, was superbly found by the winger eight yards out, and he glanced a header past Pickford for the opener. Sunderland nearly levelled moments later, but Anichebe's deflected effort came off the left post, before Jermain Defoe hit the side-netting from an angle. Vardy and Lamine Kone in action on Tuesday night The visitors were made to pay on 78 minutes, as Albrighton fed Vardy to finish superbly into the top left corner with his left foot from 14 yards, his seventh goal in nine games for club and country. That's how it stayed, and the result means Sunderland have not scored in six Premier League games.

The on-loan AC Milan forward put the Hornets ahead in the 13th minute with a brilliant strike from outside the box. He then provided a fine assist after half-time for Troy Deeney to become the first Watford player to score in four successive home matches in the top flight. Miguel Britos was sent off in the 65th minute after getting a second yellow card for bringing down Salomon Rondon, but the Hornets held out for a win that moves them 10 points clear of the relegation zone. They also move up to ninth in the Premier League, a place behind West Brom, who were unable to reproduce the same kind of performance that saw them take four points from Arsenal and Manchester United in their last two matches. Niang celebrates after putting Watford ahead in the first half While Deeney returned to the Watford starting line-up along with Sebastian Prodl, the Baggies started with the same side that drew at Old Trafford on Saturday. That, perhaps, contributed to their slow start, as they struggled to get on the ball in the opening half an hour. Nacer Chadli did have an early chance when he flicked a shot across an open goal from a tight angle after his initial shot rebounded up off Heurelho Gomes. Deeney tussles with Allan Nyom during the early stages at Vicarage Road But it was the Hornets who took the lead after 13 minutes as Deeney headed down for Niang, who cut inside and then fired a fantastic shot into the far corner. The hosts looked buoyed by the goal and they controlled the game until late in the half, when Chadli hit the post for West Brom with a 25-yard free-kick. Watford were forced into a change before half-time as Prodl went off with injury, while the visitors brought on Matt Phillips at the break. Deeney wheels away after putting Watford 2-0 up against West Brom But the Hornets doubled their advantage early in the second half, with Niang playing a brilliant first-time pass from halfway to split the West Brom defence and Deeney finishing past Ben Foster to score his 100th league goal for the Hornets. Chadli had a chance to cut the deficit shortly afterwards but he volleyed wide from Chris Brunt's pass over the top. Watford were then reduced to 10 men as Britos was shown a second yellow card for bringing down substitute Rondon as they tussled for the ball. While Walter Mazzarri fumed on the touchline, the Hornets defended resolutely to see out the win. Rondon headed on to the roof of the net and Allan Nyom saw a late volley blocked but otherwise West Brom struggled to create clear chances on a disappointing night for Tony Pulis' side.

Phil Jagielka edged the visitors ahead with a brilliantly improvised finish on 22 minutes before United piled on the pressure in the second half. Ibrahimovic had a header controversially ruled out for offside before scoring from the spot in the 94th minute after Ashley Williams was sent off for deliberately handling Luke Shaw's goal-bound shot. The hosts endured another hugely frustrating night at Old Trafford, striking the woodwork twice and squandering a number of chances. Jose Mourinho's side have now drawn their last three home league matches, scoring just two goals in the process. The result keeps them fifth but means they miss the chance to put pressure on fourth-place Manchester City, who face Chelsea on Wednesday. Jose Mourinho looks on as his Manchester United side struggle to break Everton down Everton, much improved from their Merseyside derby defeat, remain seventh and sit level with Arsenal on 51 points, although Arsene Wenger's side have three games in hand. Having been held scoreless against West Brom, United hoped Ibrahimovic's return from suspension would alleviate their troubles in front of goal. But the striker looked a little rusty when wasting the first chance of the game, allowing Williams to recover and block his left-foot strike. Zlatan Ibrahimovic went close in the first half for United Kevin Mirallas, one of two Everton changes from Saturday's Anfield loss, looked bright alongside Romelu Lukaku and forced the corner that led to their opener. Williams' looping header kept the ball alive and Jagielka held off Marcos Rojo to turn past David de Gea with the outside of his foot. The goal stung United into action and they twice went close before half-time. It was Ander Herrera on both occasions as the Spaniard, returning from a two-match ban, first struck the crossbar from close range after Joel Robles saved Daley Blind's free-kick. Herrera forced the Everton goalkeeper into another excellent stop with his second effort, a 25-yard drive that was expertly tipped wide. Ibrahimovic speaks with Everton goalkeeper Joel Robles Mourinho called on Paul Pogba at the break but the Frenchman's arrival initially did little to change United's attacking fortunes. His header came off the woodwork 10 minutes into the second half as Everton dug in and played on the counter-attack. Ibrahimovic thought he had levelled when his header squirmed under Robles but a marginal decision went Everton's way, serving to increase the sense of frustration among the home support. Zlatan Ibrahimovic scores from the penalty spot in stoppage time Marouane Fellaini and Marcos Rojo each wasted chances for United as time ticked away before Williams, excellent for much of the game, conceded a late penalty. Shaw, whose attitude was questioned by Mourinho earlier this week, was lively upon replacing the injured Ashley Young and it was his effort that forced the spot-kick.

In a tense game with few clear-cut chances, it will be the Swans who feel the more aggrieved of the two teams, especially with second-placed Tottenham Hotspur to play on Wednesday. As a result of this stalemate, Swansea remain a point clear of Hull City in 18th, while 19th-placed Boro are still deep in trouble, five points behind their opponents, albeit with a game in hand on the Swans. Swansea were without leading scorer Fernando Llorente with an ankle injury, meaning a start up front for Jordan Ayew. Middlesbrough skipper Ben Gibson insists that they still have every chance of staying up after their 0-0 draw at Swansea Middlesbrough skipper Ben Gibson insists that they still have every chance of staying up after their 0-0 draw at Swansea The likes of Kyle Naughton, Martin Olsson and Luciano Narsingh were also all recalled as the Swans made three changes from their 2-0 loss at Bournemouth last time out, with Stephen Kingsley and Ki-Sung-Yueng both dropping out. The visitors, meanwhile, made one change from their 3-1 home defeat to Man Utd in their last league outing, with Grant Leadbitter making way for the more attack-minded Adama Traore. It was the home side, looking to respond after losing back-to-back league games for the first time under Paul Clement, who made the more impressive start of the two. Rudy Gestede (left) vies with Swansea's Alfie Mawson at the Liberty Stadium Martin Olsson nearly opened the scoring after just seven minutes, but after cutting in from the wing, the left-back fired wastefully over the crossbar. Three minutes later and Ayew almost marked his start for the Swans with a goal, only for Boro 'keeper Victor Valdes to stand tall and beat the Ghana international's thumping drive away to safety. However, Middlesbrough - the lowest scorers in the Premier League - also had their moments in the first half, with the visitors feeling hard done by not to have been awarded a penalty after 13 minutes when Stewart Downing's close-range shot struck the hand of Alfie Mawson. Middlesbrough caretaker boss Steve Agnew credited his players as they fought to the end for a point at Swansea Middlesbrough caretaker boss Steve Agnew credited his players as they fought to the end for a point at Swansea Referee Bobby Madley waved away their appeals as once again Boro went in at the break without having had an effort on target in the first period. Not that the Swans were creating a whole host of chances themselves, with the closet Clement's side coming to making the breakthrough before half-time being Tom Carroll's long-range strike that flew just past Valdes' right-hand post. Boro defender Fabio da Silva (left) rises high to win a header against Leroy Fer In fairness, both teams came out with more intent after the interval, with Middlesbrough twice going close to opening the scoring before the hour-mark. However, after working himself some space on the edge of the area, Traore drilled a shot across the six-yard box, while Lukasz Fabianski then had to be alert to keep out Alvaro Negredo's close-range shot after a mazy dribble down the right by the former Barcelona player. Swansea boss Paul Clement says that he hopes the 0-0 draw will be a good point at the end of the season Swansea boss Paul Clement says that he hopes the 0-0 draw will be a good point at the end of the season Despite Boro's probings, however, it was Swansea who nearly took the lead after 64 minutes when Gylfi Sigurdsson, twisting and turning some 25 yards out, unleashed a vicious curler. But again Valdes was up to the test with an acrobatic one-handed stop to deny the Iceland playmaker. The home side carried on pressing right till the end, with Sigurdsson's late free-kick being deflected inches past the post by Adam Forshaw, albeit possibly with the use of a hand, before Mawson's header from the resulting corner was punched clear by Valdes. And the visitors very nearly won it in injury time, only for substitute Rudy Gestede to nod Negredo's cross just past the post.

Gunners twice come from behind to take point from City clash 2:50 Watch highlights of Arsenal 2-2 Man City Watch highlights of Arsenal 2-2 Man City Arsenal twice came from behind to claim a 2-2 draw with Man City at the Emirates on Sunday. The Gunners had lost their last two league outings at the Emirates, and were stunned by Pep Guardiola's men early as Leroy Sane put the visitors ahead inside five minutes. Theo Walcott put Arsenal level on the 40 minute mark with a scrambled finish, but Sergio Aguero hit home on an angle two minutes later to see Man City move ahead again. But eight minutes after the restart, a Shkodran Mustafi header got the Gunners back on level terms and ultimately earned a point, although they remain in sixth place and seven points behind Man City in fourth. Man City celebrate after Leroy Sane's opening goal at the Emirates Like their previous meeting in December, the game got off to a fast start with Man City taking the lead after five minutes. Kevin De Bruyne cleared a ball up the field from deep inside his own half, which turned into a great throughball that Sane latched onto the end of, racing down the left-hand side of the box before firing into the corner. City did not let up in the proceeding minutes, with De Bruyne once again in attacking action, lashing a shot against the post from the right-hand side before David Silva's effort from the rebound drew a fantastic leaping save from David Ospina. 5 - Leroy Sane has scored the quickest PL goal at the Emirates for a visiting team since Louis Saha for Spurs in Feb 2012. Napping. — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) April 2, 2017 Arsenal started to find their feet though with Mesut Ozil testing Willy Cabellero in the 23rd minute but his sliding shot was at the near post was an easy collection for the Man City stopper before Alexis Sanchez just curled wide of the top corner eight minutes later. The hosts got themselves level with five minutes of the half to play, although it was not the cleanest of goals. Mustafi headed the ball over the Man City defence, landing to the feet of Walcott who scrapped with Gael Clichy in the six-yard box before managing to poke home. Shkodran Mustafi celebrates after scoring Arsenal's second equaliser at the Emirates But it took City just 131 seconds to retake the lead. Silva did brilliantly to play the ball into the path of Aguero on the right of the box who thrashed the ball into the bottom corner on an angle and see the visitors ahead at the break. Each side made a change at half-time, with Gabriel Paulista and Yaya Toure replacing Laurent Koscielny and Raheem Sterling respectively, and it was Arsenal who got back on level terms eight minutes after the restart. 5 - Theo Walcott has scored five goals in his last five Premier league games against Manchester City. Thorn. — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) April 2, 2017 Mustafi was the man to rise above the pack as Ozil delivered a swinging corner, with some scrambled defending from City allowing the German to nod home from close range. It was Man City who went closest to scoring the next goal after being pegged back for a second time, with Fernandinho forcing another fine stop from Ospina not long after as he volleyed from the top of the box before the Arsenal stopper also denied Aguero a headed second in the 67th minute. Sergio Aguero of Manchester City celebrates scoring his side's second goal As the game wore on, the chances became further apart as both sides looked to settle for a point, although City arguably went the closest to stealing the win as Aguero headed wide on the 90 minute mark and a handball call against Nacho Monreal with of the last kicks of the game but Andre Marriner remained unmoved. The spoils ultimately ended up shared with the result receiving a muted response from both sets of fans at the full-time whistle.

Sadio Mane opened the scoring on eight minutes and Coutinho's brilliant finish restored the hosts' advantage after Matthew Pennington had levelled on his first start of the season. Divock Origi, who replaced an injured Mane in the second half, made the points safe, moving Liverpool above Manchester City, who face Arsenal on Super Sunday, one of two games in hand they hold on Jurgen Klopp's side. The victory extends their unbeaten run over Everton to 13 league matches, equalling their longest run last achieved between 1972 and 1978, and ensures Klopp becomes the first Liverpool manager to win his first three league Merseyside derbies. It was the perfect tribute to the late Ronnie Moran, who was remembered with a minute's applause before kick-off following his death last week. Sadio Mane opened the scoring for Liverpool but was later forced off injured The result leaves Everton in seventh place and level with Arsenal on 50 points, albeit having played three games more than the Gunners.

Dejan Lovren felt that Liverpool produced a compact performance and praised the togetherness of the team Dejan Lovren felt that Liverpool produced a compact performance and praised the togetherness of the team A number of injuries over the international break - including Seamus Coleman's broken leg - forced Ronald Koeman into two changes from their 4-0 win over Hull City. Pennington made his first start since last May and Mason Holgate replaced the injured Coleman as the Everton boss named five players under the age of 23 in his line-up. Lucas Leiva and Dejan Lovren stepped in for Adam Lallana and Ragnar Klavan for Liverpool, who enjoyed the perfect start against their local rivals. Mane played a one-two with Roberto Firmino and shrugged off the challenge of Tom Davies before firing into the far corner. It was the 50th Premier League Merseyside derby The visitors hit back through an unlikely source as Pennington turned home after Liverpool failed to clear a corner, but Everton did not stay level for long. Coutinho had already squandered an earlier opportunity when he cut inside three minutes later and curled a beauty past Robles to put Liverpool back ahead. It was a moment of magic in a frantic first-half that included plenty of fierce challenges, with Ross Barkley particularly fortunate to stay on the pitch after mistimed lunges on Emre Can and Lovren. Phil Jagielka blamed defensive errors for Everton's defeat in the derby Phil Jagielka blamed defensive errors for Everton's defeat in the derby The England international then created the first opening after the break but Ashley Williams failed to turn his free-kick past Simon Mignolet. The game appeared to be swinging back towards Everton and that feeling was strengthened when Mane was forced off following a collision with Leighton Baines. But Origi, on to replace his injured team-mate, provided swift relief, adding Liverpool's third with a powerful finish from Coutinho's pass. Divock Origi stepped off the bench to score Liverpool's third goal It was a 20-yard strike aided by a bizarre piece of goalkeeping by Robles, who allowed the ball to nestle into the centre of the goal. Holgate twice went close as Everton looked to respond, first seeing his deflected shot saved by Mignolet before heading over from close range, while substitute Kevin Mirallas also blazed over. But they failed to put serious pressure on Liverpool, who extended their unbeaten run against opponents in the top 10 to 15 matches.

It was a mostly even affair until the 66th minute when Eric Dier hit home from a Christian Eriksen corner, before Heung-Min Son tapped in from a Dele Alli cross 11 minutes later to give Spurs their first league win at Turf Moor. There was also concern for Harry Winks who was stretchered off at half-time after injuring his ankle, while Burnley had few chances to speak of as they lost their first home league game since a 2-1 defeat to Man City in November. With Chelsea beaten by Crystal Palace, Tottenham have now closed the gap on the Premier League leaders to seven points while Burnley remain on 32 points. Burnley named an unchanged side from their last Premier League outing while Mauricio Pochettino handed rare starts to Vincent Janssen, Kieran Trippier and Winks in three changes from the 2-1 win against Southampton just under two weeks ago. Heung-Min Son celebrates scoring the second goal for Tottenham The first half saw chances at a premium, with the Clarets having the first effort of the game in the eighth minute as Matt Lowton fizzed a cross from the right-hand side that Ashley Barnes could only head into the hands of Hugo Lloris before Toby Alderweireld fired a fierce drive straight at Tom Heaton ten minutes later. Tottenham had the best effort of the opening period in the 33rd minute as Christian Eriksen powered down the field, getting down the left-hand side of the box and seeing his cross-come-shot saved by the fingertips of Heaton. The rebound then fell to the feet of Alli with an open net at his mercy but the 20-year-old could only smash his effort over the crossbar. Tottenham last won away from home on New Year's Day against Watford The half did not end well for the visitors who were forced into two late substitutions as Victor Wanyama repeatedly went down with an injury before being replaced in the 43rd minute by Mousa Dembele. Winks then landed awkwardly on his ankle just after as he tried to tackle Stephen Ward before rolling into equipment in the Burnley technical area. Moussa Sissoko replaced him in one of the last actions of the opening 45 minutes, with the 21-year-old stretchered off at half-time and taken to hospital. 1 - Eric Dier has scored his first Premier League goal in 475 days, since netting vs Newcastle in December 2015. Straits. — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) April 1, 2017 The second period continued in a very similar vein to the first, with Heaton called into saves in the opening ten minutes as Janssen - making his first Premier League start in 2017 - tested the stopper from the left-hand side of the box before he played a delightful give-and-go with Ben Davies who also forced a low save. Tottenham found the breakthrough in the 66th minute, as Eriksen whipped in a corner that found Jeff Hendrick at the back post but he could only clear into the path of Dier in the six-yard box who stroked home to score his first Premier League goal since December 2015. Harry Winks was stretchered off after picking up an injury late in the first half Burnley had some half efforts sandwiched between the two goals, with Michael Keane collecting a long pass, rounded former team-mate Trippier at the top of the box, but could only lash wide of the post before Ashley Barnes laid the ball off for Scott Arfield at the top of the box but he again could only hit over the crossbar. The visitors rounded off their victory in the 77th minute after the introduction of Son for Janssen, with Eriksen doing well to spot the run of Alli to his right.The midfielder then burst down the side of the box, cutting the ball back for Son in the six-yard box who slotted home to see Spurs win their first away Premier League game since a 4-1 win against Watford on New Year's Day.

The hosts took the lead in fine style in the fifth minute. Eden Hazard and Cesc Fabregas combined to create an easy chance for Fabregas to convert, as they looked on course for a 14th home win in a row. However, two goals in 91 seconds sensationally turned the match on its head as Wilfried Zaha brilliantly equalised in the ninth minute, before Christian Benteke cheekily chipped the ball over Thibaut Courtois to give Palace the lead. Wilfried Zaha celebrates scoring his side's first goal The league leaders threw everything at Palace in search of an equaliser, but the Eagles were not to be denied a fourth win in a row, while Tottenham will have been given hope in their quest for a first Premier League crown by the Blues' slip-up. Antonio Conte brought Eden Hazard back into the starting XI, and the Belgium international didn't look like he was feeling any effects of the calf injury he'd been carrying as he created a chance Fabregas couldn't miss. Fabregas started the move himself, picking out Hazard superbly on the left. Joel Ward afforded Hazard far too much space, which he exploited nipping to the byline before pulling it back for Fabregas to steer home from close range. Christian Benteke celebrates scoring Crystal Palace's second goal against Chelsea Then, four minutes later, Zaha equalised out of nowhere. The ball into him was difficult to control, but he pulled it down brilliantly, drove into space before firing into the bottom corner, through the legs of two Chelsea defenders. Palace were handed a lifeline by referee Craig Pawson in the 15th minute as Andros Townsend appeared to handle on the line. Nothing was given. Wayne Hennessey was then forced into a fine stop to deny Costa after more great work from Hazard to pick out the Spain international, he swivelled and fired at goal, but Hennessey stuck out a leg to block. Cesc Fabregas celebrates scoring his sides first goal After the break, Palace lost two defenders through injury, but they kept their shape and put their bodies on the line time and again. Just after the hour mark Palace could have put further daylight between them and the Blues, but Courtois pulled off a fantastic stop to deny Zaha with his feet. 14 minutes from time came the chance that Chelsea's pressure merited, but Costa somehow missed the target with a header from close range, with the goal at his mercy. Scott Dann (right) blocks an attempt from Diego Costa For all their possession and chances, Hennessey was in fact only forced to make meaningful saves on a handful of occasions. The Palace goal did live a charmed life at times, as Willian and Hazard drilled the ball across the face of goal, evading everyone and running out of play. Zaha wasted another chance to put the game to bed late on, blazing over after great work from Jason Puncheon to pick him out, but the Eagles held on for a vital three points, with the 2-1 scoreline a replica of this fixture last season.

The Hammers had taken the lead after 18 minutes when Andy Carroll expertly brought down Aaron Cresswell's long ball unchallenged and slotted past Eldin Jakupovic to open the scoring. The goal did not dampen the Tigers' spirit and although they failed to trouble Darren Randolph in the first half, the second half saw a complete turnaround as they came alive and put West Ham on the back foot for large periods. Hull City's Andrea Ranocchia celebrates scoring the winning goal against West Ham After bringing on Kamil Grosicki at half-time, the play immediately improved and the resurgence was kicked into gear when a flowing move was concluded by Andy Robertson slotting home after 53 minutes. Five minutes from time, they put the icing on the cake when Ranocchia headed home Grosicki's cross at the near post to add three points to their survival total. Firmly rooted in the bottom three, Hull were largely unchanged from the side that lost 4-0 to Everton two weeks ago. Tom Huddlestone missed out through suspension, while Oumar Niasse returned to the starting 11. Robert Snodgrass lined up against his former employers for the first time since his January move south. The Tigers got off to a good start, knowing a win was feasible against a Hammers side who had lost their previous three in the league. However, it was Slaven Bilic's men who broke the deadlock. Curtis Davies and Robertson watched on as Cresswell launched a sumptuous long ball into the area. The former then mistimed his header, while the latter made no attempt to challenge Carroll as he brought the ball down with his chest and sidefooted past Jakupovic - his 50th Premier League goal. West Ham's Andy Carroll celebrates scoring his 50th Premier League goal. Randolph almost gifted the home side an equaliser just before the half hour when he dribbled Sam Byram's back pass out of the area, rather than lumping it. And moments later there were calls for a penalty when he lunged at Abel Hernandez when the striker dared to try to dispossess him. Lanzini soon tried to bend an effort into Jakupovic's far post but the stopper somehow managed to get fingertips to it. It was at half-time that the game changed. Marco Silva has overseen a revolution at Hull in his short time at the club and continued with a substitution that turned out to be a masterstroke: taking off Davies and replacing him with Grosicki. Just eight minutes into the second half, the change paid off. There were a series of passes just outside the West Ham area before the flowing move made its way to the substitute. He knocked the ball into the path of Robertson, who dragged the ball out wide, before slotting home from close range. Andrew Robertson celebrates scoring Hull's first goal with Lazar Markovic Carroll had a bullet header claimed just before the hour mark, before Lanzini hit a cross-field pass to Sofiane Feghouli at the back post. Had Carroll been on the end of the cross, perhaps this game would have had a different ending. But it didn't. The Hammers struggled to batten down the hatches when Alfred N'Diaye hit the post and five minutes before the end of normal time, the KCOM roof was almost lifted off when Ranocchia met Grosicki's corner. The defender, who had been in the wars all afternoon, leapt highest at the near post to nod past Randolph and hand the Tigers an important win in their fight against the drop.

"report": "2:38 Leicester 2-0 Stoke Leicester 2-0 Stoke Leicester City's recent upturn in form continued as the champions beat a lethargic Stoke City 2-0 at the King Power on Saturday afternoon to record a fourth Premier League win in a row. Goals in each half from Wilfred Ndidi and Jamie Vardy, his fourth in his last four league matches, saw interim boss Craig Shakespeare become the first British manager to win his first four Premier League games. As a result, the Foxes have moved up to 13th in the table, now six points from safety, while the Potters remain ninth after suffering a sixth league defeat in their last eight away games. Leicester midfielder Danny Drinkwater was fit to play despite being unavailable for England action with a hip injury. However, the Foxes were still without influential skipper Wes Morgan due to a back problem, while Nampalys Mendy also missed out. Meanwhile, Stoke playmaker Xherdan Shaqiri was absent with a calf injury, and the Swiss joined the likes of Geoff Cameron and Jack Butland on the sidelines. And Phil Bardsley was also missing after his sending-off last time out against Chelsea, although the visitors were boosted by the early return from injury of Glen Johnson. The Foxes, looking to win three straight Premier League home games for the first time since a year ago, started on the front foot, with centre-back Yohan Benalouane flashing an early effort just wide of the far post. However, Leicester's early pressure was rewarded when they made the stunning breakthrough after 25 minutes. Leicester City midfielder Wilfred Ndidi celebrates after opening the scoring against Stoke Danny Simpson found Ndidi in space some 25 yards out and the Nigerian then strode forward before unleashing an unstoppable effort that flew past a helpless Lee Grant and into the top right-hand corner of the net. And while that may have been the home side's first strike on target in the match, their early pressure and possession did warrant a goal, with Demarai Gray - who was only playing because Marc Albrighton was ill - outstanding in the first period. The mercurial Riyad Mahrez also appeared back to his best, as shown by one of his typical mazy dribbles that only ended with Grant turning the forward's shot past his near post. Stoke, though, were disappointing before the break, with the visitors' first and only strike on target coming after 36 minutes when Saido Berahino's run was picked out by Ramadan Sobhi, only for the frontman to hit it straight at Kasper Schmeichel. If the Potters thought they were still in the contest at the interval, those thoughts were soon dispelled when Vardy doubled Leicester's lead two minutes into the second half. Simpson - with his second assist of the game - chipped the ball into the box for the unmarked England international to rifle a volley past Grant, who remained rooted to the spot. Thereafter the Foxes controlled the tempo of the match, trying to catch their opponents on the break. But for a series of impressive stops by Grant, Leicester's winning margin would have been even greater.

"report": "2:54 Manchester Utd 0-0 West Brom Manchester Utd 0-0 West Brom Manchester United drew for the eighth time at Old Trafford this season as West Brom held them to a 0-0 draw on Saturday. The result does stretch United's unbeaten run to 19 games in the Premier League but they are now four points behind fourth-placed Manchester City. Jose Mourinho's men struggled to find any tempo in their attacking play but Baggies goalkeeper Ben Foster did produce a stunning late stop to deny Marcus Rashford's fabulous free-kick. However, Darren Fletcher nearly won it for the visitors after David de Gea spilled an effort onto the crossbar. Juan Mata, Paul Pogba, Chris Smalling and Phil Jones all were missing for Mourinho through injury, while Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Ander Herrera were serving suspensions. The United boss made three changes from the team that beat Middlesbrough 3-1 with Marcus Rojo, Henrik Mkhitaryan and Anthony Martial returning. Despite the lengthy absentee list, there was still no place for Wayne Rooney, who was on the bench, with Marcus Rashford preferred up top. Hal Robson Kanu, who scored in West Brom's 3-1 win over Arsenal, replaced Salomon Rondon in the only change from the side that beat the Gunners. The Baggies had not kept a clean sheet in their last 13 away Premier League games and looked keen to end that run as they set up to frustrate United by defending deep. Manchester United were frustrated in the 0-0 draw with West Brom It worked too, with United's only real outlet being Martial, whose direct running at least gave the Baggies defence questions to answer. The only chance of a monotonous first half fell to Martial on 30 minutes but his back-post header, where he rose above Craig Dawson, was directed two yards wide. The match continued in the same pattern after the break with West Brom soaking up United's timid attacking play. Mkhitaryan did bundle his way through on 65 minutes after a mistake from Gareth McAuley, but Foster came to the rescue to deflect the ball to safety. Manchester United striker Anthony Martial is challenged by West Bromwich Albion's Darren Fletcher Rooney was sent on with 19 minutes to play but had little effect on proceedings as Jonny Evans and McAuley defended their box with some outstanding clearances. Rashford, fed up of being marked out of the game by the Baggies back-line, starting taking pot-shots from range and Foster had to be alert to parry away a powerful effort from 30 yards. West Brom rarely emerged into United's territory and only mustered three shots on goal, but one of them nearly caught out De Gea with 10 minutes left. The former United man tried his luck from 25 yards, which was straight at De Gea, however, the goalkeeper let the ball slip through his fingers but the ball ricocheted back off the crossbar and into his hands. West Brom goalkeeper Ben Foster (right) shows his appreciation to the fans after the draw at Old Trafford There was to be one last chance for United but Rashford's spectacular effort from a 30-yard free-kick was turned over the crossbar with one hand by Foster. Next up for United is Everton at Old Trafford on Tuesday night.

Britos' 58th-minute header is all that separated the two sides in a lively match, which deepens Sunderland's woes at the foot of the table. Adnan Januzaj and Fabio Borini came closest to scoring for the Black Cats with a good chance each in the second half, but it was the Hornets who were able to hold on for the win. The result leaves Sunderland bottom of the table, but do have a game in hand. Meanwhile, Watford's first win since February 4 sends them up to 10th. Watford started the game without top goalscorer Troy Deeney, who was forced to sit on the bench with a stomach bug. Otherwise, it was three additional changes for the Hornets with Jose Holebas, Abdoulaye Doucoure and Nordin Amrabat coming in. For Sunderland, Sebastian Larsson dropped to the bench as the Black Cats went to three at the back, with Lamine Kone returning to the starting line-up. Younes Kaboul contesting for the ball with Adnan Januzaj The first half was open and lively, despite a lack of goals. Sunderland's goalkeeper Jordan Pickford was forced into making a double save in the 11th minute, first parrying away a low shot from M'Baye Niang and then a similar Doucoure attempt from the right flank. Watford then came close again eight minutes later as Etienne Capoue played a cross into the box for Stefano Okaka who, despite being unmarked, headed his attempt over the bar. Former Sunderland defender Younes Kaboul was forced to come off for Daryl Janmaat five minutes before half-time with a hamstring injury, and two minutes later Sunderland had their best chance of the half. Januzaj, on the right flank, cut onto his left foot and had a shot on goal which deflected off Craig Cathcart before going inches wide of the post. Sunderland's Jermain Defoe went down with an injury, but played the rest of the match Jermain Defoe picked up a slight injury in the 47th minute after colliding with Doucoure, but he was able to shrug it off and continue the match. However, he did not look entirely comfortable for the remainder of the game. With Watford the more dominant side beginning the second half, they were the ones who broke the deadlock. In the 58th minute, a corner by Tom Cleverley reached Okaka in the box. His goal-bound header was intercepted by Borini, with the Italian only able to head it onto his own team's crossbar. Cathcart was then able to cushion a header across the face of the goal for Britos to nod in from just a few yards out. Miguel Britos scored his first goal for the Hornets Watford could have easily made it 2-0 just four minutes later as substitute Isaac Success was slipped through by Okaka, but Pickford was able to get down and make a good save with his legs. Januzaj then had a great opportunity to give Sunderland a much-needed equaliser in the 65th minute. Didier N'Dong down the right cut back and squared a ball for the former Manchester United man to simply tuck the ball into a corner, but he found neither, which allowed Watford goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes to make an easy save. As the game became increasingly scrappy, with Sunderland receiving three yellow cards between the 70th and 80th minute, Gomes was called into action again seven minutes from time. A powerful shot from Borini from the edge of the box was expertly tipped around the post by the Brazil goalkeeper.

Substitute Arter blazed a penalty well over the bar in the 79th minute, taking up a chunk of the St Mary's turf with it, after Ryan Bertrand had brought down Ryan Fraser in the area. Dusan Tadic hit the post for Saints in the first half, while Artur Boruc brilliantly tipped over a Jay Rodriguez effort just before the break. Benik Afobe should have given Bournemouth the lead in the second half, but poked the ball just wide when one-on-one with Fraser Forster, before Adam Smith hit the post with a low drive. The result means Southampton stay in 11th, while Bournemouth remain 12th, level on points with their south-coast opponents. Rodriguez started for Saints in place of the injured Manolo Gabbiadini, while Bournemouth were unchanged from the 2-0 win over Swansea a fortnight ago. In a first half lacking in clear-cut opportunities, Saints had the best of the play, but Bournemouth went close just after the half-hour mark as Andrew Surman's poked effort was cleared off the line by Steven Davis. Tadic then hit the post with a neat curled effort on the edge of the box for Saints after a fine move, before Maya Yoshida headed over from a Tadic corner. Jay Rodriguez and Simon Francis battle to win a header Boruc was at his best to deny Rodriguez a goal in first-half stoppage time as the chances started to fall the hosts' way, tipping over the striker's half-volley from an angle inside the area. The second half began flat, but Bournemouth should have been ahead just after the hour mark after Afobe poked wide having been put through on goal by Josh King as the visitors broke two versus one. James Ward-Prowse then drove the ball just wide moments later, before substitute Shane Long dinked the ball just wide. Smith then hit the post with a low deflected effort from 20, and with 11 mintues remaining, Eddie Howe's side had the best chance of the game. After Bertrand had pulled Fraser back with his arm inside the box, referee Jon Moss pointed to the spot, only for Arter to blaze yards over the bar as his left foot slipped before striking with his right. Arter nearly atoned for the miss moments later, forcing Fraser into a good save with a long-range drive, but his penalty miss was decisive as it ended goalless.

United dominated the opening exchanges and deservedly took the lead through Marouane Fellaini in the 30th minute - the Belgium international's first league goal since December 2015. The hosts pressed for an equaliser, but a sensational Lingard strike from 25 yards in the 62nd minute doubled United's lead. Substitute Rudy Gestede did give the hosts hope with a goal in the 78th minute - Middlesbrough's first from open play in over nine hours and 50 minutes of Premier League football - but despite late pressure, a fortuitous Antonio Valencia tap-in after a slip by Victor Valdes made sure the visitors took all three points. Fellaini celebrates his goal with team-mates Tempers frayed towards the end of a match, with Gestede and Eric Bailly squaring up to each other in an unseemly end to the game, with the tension also appearing to bubble over into the tunnel. The result sees United finally climb above sixth in the table, leapfrogging Arsenal into fifth, while Middlesbrough's position is looking more perilous by the week, as they are now five points from safety in 19th. Jose Mourinho shuffled his pack after the midweek Europa League win over Rostov, with Marcus Rashford leading the line in the absence of the suspended Zlatan Ibrahimovic. It wasn't long before the United striker had sprang the offside trap, racing past static Boro defender Bernardo before being denied by a smart save from Valdes down low to his left. Jesse Lingard celebrates after scoring United's second goal against Middlesbrough The hosts also started well, and David de Gea was forced into a strong save from a rasping Gaston Ramirez effort from the edge of the box after 13 minutes. Valdes seemed to have a point to prove to his former employer. His double save to first deny Rashford from close range after a low Juan Mata cross, and then Valencia on the rebound with his feet was right out of the top drawer. The pressure told in the 30th minute as United took the lead. No team in the bottom half of the Premier League had a better home defensive record than Boro prior to this encounter, but their backline allowed Ashley Young far too much time and space to pick out an unmarked Fellaini who headed home past a helpless Valdes. Fellaini directs a header past Victor Valdes to score the opening goal at the Riverside Middlesbrough responded well, and piled the pressure on for the remainder of the half, but United held firm until the break. The Teesside wind was causing havoc in the second half, as several Middlesbrough crosses failed to make it into the box after being caught in gusts, but there was nothing the elements could do to stop Lingard brilliantly doubling United's lead. As the Boro defence backed off, Lingard carried the ball forward at pace before letting fly with a 25-yard strike which flew past Valdes into the top corner.

The action boiled over in stoppage time as Gestede and Bailly clashed and there was time for further drama. Valdes slipped when trying to clear the ball and Valencia stole in, walking the ball home to ensure Middlesbrough's wait for a victory in 2017 goes on.

Mauricio Pochettino's men made it 10 consecutive wins at White Hart Lane in the league - 15 without loss overall - and cemented their bid to finish in the top four thanks to first-half goals from Christian Eriksen and Dele Alli. Eriksen's fine strike after 15 minutes set Spurs on their way before Alli was fouled by Steven Davis in the box just after the half hour mark and the midfielder picked himself up to convert from the spot. James Ward-Prowse - called up by England for the first time this week - pulled a goal back from close range early in the second half. But despite an ultimately even match-up, it was Tottenham who held out to take the spoils, who are now 10 points behind Chelsea at the top of the table while Southampton remain in 10th place on 33 points. Christian Eriksen celebrates scoring his side's first goal of the game The Saints named an unchanged side for the fourth game in a row, while Heung-Min Son was chosen to replace the injured Harry Kane in just one change for Tottenham from their last Premier League outing. Son was soon testing the Southampton defence as Eriksen picked him out inside four minutes with a ball over the top, but Fraser Forster was there to keep out his shot at the near post. But, 10 minutes later, Spurs got their opening goal as Mousa Dembele slid the ball to the feet of Eriksen in the middle of the park, and the Dane bursted past three Southampton players before taking aim from just outside the box and picking out the bottom corner. Dele Alli scored Tottenham's second goal from the penalty spot It could have been two for the hosts on the 25-minute mark as Forster got down low to palm away a Toby Alderweireld header, but Southampton also had good chances of their own. Not long after, Manolo Gabbiadini rocketed an effort just past the back post, rippling the side-netting, before Dusan Tadic fired over the crossbar from the six-yard box as the Saints looked for an equaliser. Gabbiadini was forced off with an injury on 30 minutes and shortly afterwards, Alli was fouled in the box by Davis. In the absence of Kane, it was Alli himself who stepped up, sending Forster the wrong way to net his 11th goal in 12 Premier League games. Southampton headed into the break feeling aggrieved that they were not awarded a penalty of their own in added time. Tadic was clipped by Ben Davies in the box, but despite the Saints man needing medical attention, referee Andre Marriner did not point to the spot as they ended the half 2-0 behind. Manolo Gabbiadini was taken off injured and was replaced by Shane Long The visitors wasted little time in getting themselves back in the game though. It was an unusual defensive mistake from Alderweireld as he failed to clear a Ryan Bertrand cross from the left flank, allowing Ward-Prowse to control it on his chest before slotting home. Spurs could have hit back immediately afterwards as Eriksen pulled the ball back into the box for Son, but the South Korea international could only fire high and wide over the crossbar from point-blank range. Heung-Min Son and Jack Stephens tussle for possession The remainder of the second half offered little in terms of attacking chances with the two sides evenly matched despite the scoreline, although the frantic final minutes of the match offered the opportunity for more goals. Alli was denied a second penalty of the afternoon after being clipped by Oriel Romeu in the box as the clock ticked towards the 90-minute mark before Forster pulled off a stunning leaping save to keep out a thunderbolt effort from Vincent Janssen. James Ward-Prowse celebrates with Shane Long after pulling a goal back for Southampton Sofiane Boufal could have been the hero for the Saints in the second of five minutes added on, but his curling shot just whistled past the upright as Tottenham saw out a tight encounter.

Fernandinho missed a sitter for City at the far post during an even first half, before James Milner gave Liverpool the lead from the penalty spot after Roberto Firmino was brought down by Gael Clichy. Sergio Aguero levelled for City with 21 minutes remaining, converting Kevin De Bruyne's fine cross after a trademark run into the box, but Liverpool had arguably the best chance to win it when Adam Lallana somehow failed to convert from Firmino's touch across the face of goal. Adam Lallana competes with Leroy Sane for possession of the ball The result means that with 30 points to play for, City end the weekend further adrift of Chelsea, while Liverpool stay fourth. Pep Guardiola made two changes from the side that lost in Monaco, bringing back Yaya Toure and Nicolas Otamendi for Bacary Sagna and Aleksandar Kolarov, while Liverpool were unchanged. City started the brighter and had the first half chance as David Silva struck wide after Leroy Sane's cross was blocked by Simon Mignolet. Lallana is closed down by Yaya Toure and Fernandinho At the other end, Sadio Mane raced free from Otamendi with just Willy Caballero to beat, but the defender made up ground well and did enough to put off the Liverpool man, whose effort was blocked. Mane appealed for a penalty, but he seemed to kick the back of Otamendi's foot as Michael Oliver waved play on. After the 1-1 draw at the Etihad, Liverpool goalscorer James Milner admitted he would have taken a point against Man City before the game After the 1-1 draw at the Etihad, Liverpool goalscorer James Milner admitted he would have taken a point against Man City before the game Coutinho shot just over moments later, before City missed a sitter with five minutes of the half remaining. After Silva had ran in-behind the Liverpool defence, his centre evaded Raheem Sterling, before Fernandinho diverted the ball wide despite having most of the open goal to aim at. Jurgen Klopp makes his way to the dugout prior to kick-off City had a legitimate call for a penalty turned down during the incident, with Milner looking to catch Sterling as he attempted to convert past Mignolet. Caballero then kept the game level before the break with two quickfire saves from Lallana and Firmino. Liverpool took the lead six minutes into the second half through Milner's penalty, after Firmino had been bundled over by Clichy inside the box as he chested down Emre Can's ball over the top of the defence. Milner, who signed for Liverpool from Man City, sent Caballero the wrong way in front of the travelling fans. James Milner (C) celebrates with team-mates after giving Liverpool a 1-0 lead Liverpool nearly had a second just after the hour mark, but Caballero raced out well to block Firmino's low effort as the visitors broke free. City levelled in the 69th minute through Aguero, who latched onto De Bruyne's superb low cross from the right to drill past Mignolet from close range, his seventh goal in seven games. De Bruyne then hit the post from 10 yards after Aguero slipped while attempting to finish off a fine move inside the area, before Liverpool missed a sitter of their own through Lallana, who fluffed his effort from Firmino's centre with just Caballero to beat eight yards out. Aguero came so close to winning it for City on two occasions, first poking the ball over at the near post, and again blazing over the bar in stoppage time from De Bruyne's deft ball.

As banners for and against Wenger were flown over The Hawthorns, Craig Dawson headed the Baggies in front on 12 minutes before Alexis Sanchez's thunderous drive hauled the Gunners level three minutes later. Substitute Hal Robson-Kanu notched only his second goal for West Brom after the break before Dawson's second saw the hosts end a two-game losing streak in style. A third successive defeat on the road leaves Arsenal in fifth, five points behind Liverpool in fourth, while Albion tighten their grip on eighth. The latest top-flight outing provided the platform for disgruntled Arsenal fans to stage another protest against Wenger, as a plane towing 'No contract #WengerOut' flew over the ground ahead of kick-off, and his afternoon got worse on 12 minutes when Dawson rose highest to head Nacer Chadli's corner beyond Petr Cech. Jamie Redknapp tore into Arsenal's performance against West Brom, calling it the type of performance that can get a manager the sack Jamie Redknapp tore into Arsenal's performance against West Brom, calling it the type of performance that can get a manager the sack A second banner - reading 'In Arsene We Trust #RespectAW' - then flew overhead and was shortly followed by Arsenal's equaliser, Granit Xhaka slipping Sanchez in behind the stationary Chadli and allowing the Chilean to rifle the ball past Ben Foster via the crossbar. Saloman Rondon, looking to score his first Premier League goal since December 14, went close to breaking his duck on the half-hour mark, but pulled a shot wide. Alexis Sanchez scores Arsenal's only goal at the Hawthorns Having both had their defences breached inside the opening quarter of an hour, both Foster and Cech were then called upon to preserve parity. Foster showed great agility to thwart Aaron Ramsey's shot on the turn before Cech went one better, tipping Darren Fletcher's forceful drive behind, but that was to be Cech's last substantial involvement as an innocuous leg injury saw him replaced by David Ospina moments later. Petr Cech was forced off with injury in the first half Rondon nearly ensured the Colombian's first task was to pick the ball out of his own net, but his 50th-minute header flashed wide. Injury forced Rondon off shortly after but his replacement, Robson-Kanu, had an immediate impact from the bench, the Wales international poking home his second Baggies goal after Ospina fumbled a cross after 55 minutes. 2 - Hal Robson-Kanu scored with his second touch of the game, just 75 seconds after coming off the bench. Impact. — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) March 18, 2017 It took 10 minutes for Arsenal to conjure a response with Danny Welbeck, making only his second start of the season, heading Xhaka's corner onto the crossbar. But having had a reprieve, the hosts nearly extended their lead a minute later as Ospina's hesitancy to come off his line saw Robson-Kanu go through on goal. Hal Robson-Kanu scored seconds after coming on as a substitute to put West Brom 2-1 up The Arsenal stopper made amends though, blocking Robson-Kanu's effort before Shkodran Mustafi cleared Chadli's follow-up off the line and Chris Brunt blazed over. But Dawson wrapped up the victory when he got clear of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Aaron Ramsey at another corner to head his second beyond Ospina. Craig Dawson heads home his second of the game With Arsenal managing just two shots on target throughout the duration of the game, the latest of which coming on 33 minutes, Wenger substituted Sanchez on 78 minutes, despite the Gunners needing two goals. That only added to the discontent in the away end, as anti-Wenger banners began to surface in tandem with Arsenal's failed attempted revival.

Chances were few and far between at Selhurst Park but an error rather than moment of brilliance proved decisive. Yohan Cabaye curled a 68th-minute free-kick right into the dangerzone, Deeney got his head to the ball to try and clear, but inadvertently diverted it into the bottom corner of his own net. Watford pressed for an equaliser, but came up short as their wretched run against the Eagles continues. The result sees Sam Allardyce's men climb to 16th ahead of a tough run of fixtures after the international break, while Watford remain in 13th. The encounter got off to a laboured start but though Wilfried Zaha was causing makeshift Watford full-back Craig Cathcart plenty of problems down the left, his good work was often in vain as he failed to find Christian Benteke in the middle. Yohan Cabaye (middle) celebrates with his team-mates Cabaye had the best chance of the opening period, but his side-footed effort was blocked, while on the stroke of half-time, the visitors' Valon Behrami volleyed high and wide from the edge of the area after the ball had fallen kindly to him. After the break, the game continued to be niggly, with Zaha at the centre of everything. The Palace winger continued to torment Cathcart, and almost broke the deadlock in the 65th minute, but fired over after working space for a shot in the box. Zaha and Sebastian Prodl then clashed but though Zaha was fortunate to get away with a swinging forearm, Prodl's return foul on the 24-year-old changed the course of the match. Andros Townsend (left) and Miguel Britos battle for possession From that free-kick, Deeney stooped, glancing the ball past Heurelho Gomes into the bottom corner. No Palace player was in the vicinity, making the incident all the more bizarre. Substitute Abdoulaye Doucoure brought a fine save from Palace stopper Wayne Hennessey as the Hornets pressed for a leveller, but they really lacked quality when it mattered most. Palace held on for the win and with trips to Chelsea and Southampton, as well as a home clash with Arsenal, to come, the three points earned against the Hornets could prove to be the difference between relegation and Premier League survival. 2 - Troy Deeney has scored more own goals for Watford in the Premier League than any other player at the club.

The striker had been in the spotlight in the build-up following his refusal to sign a new contract but he delivered an emphatic response and is now out on his own as the Premier League top scorer with 21 goals. It was 20-year-old Dominic Calvert-Lewin who put Everton ahead, slotting home Tom Davies' right-wing cross in the ninth minute to mark only his second Premier League start with a goal. Hull pushed Everton hard in the second half but their task got more difficult when Tom Huddlestone was shown a red card for a foul on Idrissa Gueye with a quarter of an hour remaining. Dominic Calvert-Lewin scored the opening goal of the game for Everton Enner Valencia came off the bench soon after and scored 69 seconds later to double the lead in the 78th minute before Lukaku's late goals added further gloss to the scoreline. Hull had chances at the other end with Sam Clucas going close to equalising in the first half when he took advantage of confusion between Ashley Williams and goalkeeper Joel Robles, but his lob was lofted just over the bar. Marco Silva appeared to tactically outmanoeuvre Ronald Koeman after the interval as the pair traded formation changes but the red card ended their hopes and Hull remain in the relegation zone. It's Everton who are looking up with the only disappointment being the loss of Morgan Schneiderlin to injury as the in-form midfielder limped off after just half an hour to be replaced by Gareth Barry. Lukaku celebrates his first and Everton's third late on But it is Lukaku who is the real key to their success. He provided the superb assist for Valencia's goal, flicking the ball over the top of the Hull defence, and the substitute returned the favour for Everton's third. The final goal was an even more composed finish, rounding Eldin Jakupovic after a poor back pass by Omar Elabdellaoui and the fans who gave Lukaku such a warm reception will be hoping there are many more to come in an Everton shirt.

In a fiery encounter at the bet365 Stadium, Chelsea - who were without the injured Eden Hazard - took the lead through Willian's free-kick in the 13th minute but Stoke hit back after Jonathan Walters, who was pushed to the ground by Cahill, scored from the spot seven minutes before the break. The Blues came close to breaking the deadlock when Marcus Alonso's free-kick struck the crossbar in the second half but Cahill struck the winner in the 87th minute to edge his side nearer to glory. Antonio Conte's side, who have 10 games left to play, now have a sizeable advantage over the chasing pack with Tottenham in action against Southampton and third-placed Manchester City hosting fourth-placed Liverpool, both live on Sky Sports on Super Sunday. There were exuberant Chelsea celebrations at the final whistle after a victory which has inched them ever closer to a seemingly inevitable title triumph. Meanwhile, Stoke, who had Phil Bardsley sent off in the closing stages of injury time for a second bookable offence, stay ninth on 36 points. Gary Cahill celebrates scoring Chelsea's winner against Stoke Chelsea's task was made even harder before the match with the news they were without Hazard, who according to Conte picked up \"a little problem.\" He was replaced by Pedro in Conte's starting line-up but it Diego Costa who was involved from the first whistle. Costa had looked to be in one of those moods from the start as he clashed with Ryan Shawcross, Geoff Cameron and Bruno Martins Indi and got short shrift from referee Anthony Taylor on each occasion. It was Costa's turn and pass on halfway which released Alonso on the left and the wing-back's run won the Blues a free-kick on the left edge of the penalty area. It looked like the perfect opportunity to deliver a cross, but Willian had other ideas and whipped his free-kick around the two-man wall and past Lee Grant, who should have done better than to just help the shot on its way in. Diego Costa congratulates Willian after his goal for Chelsea Costa was involved again moments later, picking up a caution after remonstrating with referee Taylor after giving away a free-kick for a tussle with Martins Indi. Grant atoned for his earlier error in the 30th minute, parrying Alonso's effort and Stoke thought they had levelled in the 34th minute when Joe Allen's corner was headed on by Cameron and then into the net by Martins Indi. However, the flag appeared to go up and Taylor, after a discussion with his linesman, correctly ruled the goal out for Saido Berahino's push on Cesar Azpilicueta. They didn't have to wait too much longer for an equaliser though after Cahill pushed Walters over in the box with Chelsea in no danger. Taylor pointed to the spot and Walters picked himself up off the floor to hammer the ball high past the dive of Thibaut Courtois. Jonathan Walters celebrates his equaliser for Stoke Pedro blazed over a good chance to restore the visitors' lead before Bardsley clattered into Costa to be booked in the final stages of a tempestuous half. Chelsea started the second half brighter with Alonso only stopped by a terrific Bardsley challenge and David Luiz's 40-yard free-kick almost catching Grant out. There was not much the Potters keeper could do but be thankful Alonso's 25-yard effort struck the crossbar. Grant was up to the task when called on next as he made a brilliant one-handed stop at the near post to deny Pedro once he had been slipped in by Willian. It was far from relentless from the leaders but the pressure finally told in the 87th minute when the opportunity fell to Cahill, and the Blues skipper snatched it. Erik Pieters conceded a needless corner with a poor back-pass to Grant and the Dutchman's clearance from David Luiz's header came to Cahill to fire home. Costa struck a post after that yet he was a footnote in this contest, even when the red card came out, with Bardsley the recipient for a second cautionable offence as he fouled Cesc Fabregas.

"2:09 Highlights of Sunderland's 0-0 draw at home to Burnley Highlights of Sunderland's 0-0 draw at home to Burnley Sunderland stay bottom of the Premier League after failing to score for the fourth consecutive game in their 0-0 draw with Burnley at the Stadium of Light. Substitute Sam Vokes almost stole the points for Burnley, yet to win on their travels this season, late on after a spirited second-half performance from David Moyes' side. Billy Jones, Fabio Borini and Adnan Januzaj all failed with goalscoring chances as the hosts went in search of a winner, but could not find a way through as Burnley earned only their third away point of the campaign. The result means Jermain Defoe, who was this week called up to Gareth Southgate's England squad, will end his record of scoring in every month of top-flight action since January 2016 (12 successive months) but his team-mates, more importantly, are mired in relegation trouble - seven points from safety. Jason Denayer's introduction, in for the injured Lamine Kone, unsettled Sunderland's defence as the enthusiastic Jordan Pickford rushed out too eagerly in the opening stages, the young goalkeeper grateful to see Ashley Barnes' attempted lob come to nothing inside seven minutes. Joey Barton was booked for a foul on Adnan Januzaj in the first half Burnley, unchanged from their 2-1 defeat to Liverpool, would have been a goal up four minutes later had George Boyd connected with Stephen Ward's low cross. As Sunderland struggled, Joey Barton maintained the atmosphere drawing boos at almost every touch, before earning the biggest cheer when he was deservedly booked for fouling the escaping Januzaj. Jason Denayer (left) almost allowed Sam Vokes to score late on with a mistake But Burnley continued to press and should have led three minutes before the break when Barnes met Scott Arfield's cross, but the striker managed to put it wide from less than six yards. Sunderland came out fired up in the second half though, with Januzaj's volley batted away by Tom Heaton after an excellent cross from Defoe. Full-back Jones then had the home side's best chance in the 63rd minute, but somehow headed wide of Heaton's goal after Sebastian Larsson's superb delivery. After Borini went clear only to hit his shot straight at Heaton, Vokes then capitalised on an error from Denayer to race through on goal three minutes from time, but Pickford's low save ensured Sunderland ended the game with at least a point, though they remain adrift.

Leicester West Ham 2-3 Leicester Leicester picked up their first Premier League away win of the season with an entertaining 3-2 victory over West Ham on Saturday. The Foxes, back in domestic action after their Champions League triumph. continued their markedly improved form under Craig Shakespeare at the London Stadium with early goals from Riyad Mahrez and Robert Huth seeing them on their way. Manuel Lanzini pulled a goal back for West Ham in the 20th minute with a fantastic free-kick but Jamie Vardy restored the two-goal lead with seven minutes of the first half to play as he lashed home in the six-yard box. West Ham dominated the game after Andre Ayew scored a second just after the hour mark, but some heroics from Kasper Schmeichel saw the Foxes hold on for all three points and a fourth consecutive win under Shakespeare. The Premier League champions are six points and three spots clear of the relegation places while West Ham remain in 11th after a fifth league game in a row without victory. Leicester picked up their first away Premier League win of the season on Saturday Shakespeare made one change from the side that saw off Sevilla in midweek to reach the quarter-finals, and they stormed into the lead as Mahrez opened the scoring on five minutes. His cross-come-shot from the right flew past the waiting Vardy and Shinji Okazaki in the box before nestling in the bottom corner. Two minutes later and Mahrez was involved again, passing to the unmarked Marc Albrighton at the top of the box after he had flicked a free-kick into the Algerian's path. A sublime first-touch cross into the box from the midfielder found the head of a leaping Huth, who powered the ball home. The afternoon got worse for West Ham as they were forced into an early change as skipper Winston Reid pulled up with what looked like a hamstring strain in the 16th minute, with Robert Snodgrass coming on for the defender. Manuel Lanzini scored a sublime free-kick in the first half for West Ham It did not seem to affect the Hammers as they pulled a goal back four minutes later. Danny Drinkwater fouled Michail Antonio around 20 yards out and up stepped Lanzini, who curled a pin-point free kick over the wall and into the top corner. It was an open first half as both sides continued to see half chances, but it was Leicester who dealt the next blow before half-time. It was a classic poacher's goal from Vardy as Mahrez put a fine corner into the box, which fell to the feet of the England striker in the middle of a sea of players. He reacted quickly to fire the ball home from point-blank range. The second half started at a slower pace and it took until the hour mark for either side to have a meaningful chance. Some fine vision from Mahrez picked out Vardy with a ball over the top, but Darren Randolph read the situation well to close the striker down, with Vardy's attempted chip going wide. Jamie Vardy scored the first goal for Leicester at the London Stadium Three minutes later and West Ham once again pulled back a goal, which came from a corner after another fantastic Lanzini free-kick was punched away by Schmeichel. The Hammers winger delivered, finding the head of Andy Carroll at the back post who knocked the ball back across the box and Ayew was there to nod the ball home in the six-yard box. From then on, the hosts dominated the game as they looked to take a point from the encounter, with Schmeichel getting down low at the back post in the 77th minute to keep out a Carroll header on the line with goal-line technology showing the ball was a few inches from going over. Three minutes later and the Hammers had their best chance for an equaliser in the closing exchanges as Antonio twisted and turned through the Leicester defence before sliding Ayew through, but despite being one-on-one with the goalkeeper, the striker lashed at the ball to send it careering over the crossbar. West Ham are winless in their last five Premier League outings In the third of six additional minutes, Schmeichel was the saviour for the visitors as he denied Carroll once again. A Snodgrass free-kick ricocheted into his path but his shot was pushed away by the Leicester stopper as he ensured that the Foxes took all three points.

Benik Afobe was Bournemouth's match-winner as it was his off-target effort that took a big deflection off Alfie Mawson and into the net on 31 minutes before the striker wrapped up the points with a neat finish in the second half. Despite having more of the possession, Swansea only mustered one shot on target during the 90 minutes as they lacked a cutting edge in the final third. Back-to-back wins have lifted the Cherries nine points away from the drop zone while Swansea, who have lost their last four away games, remain just three points above safety. Fernando Llorente passed a late fitness test to lead the line for Swansea, who made three changes from the 2-1 defeat at Hull - but they lacked spark in their approach play to the Spanish striker. Swansea winger Wayne Routledge (left) and Bournemouth's Joshua King challenge for the ball Gylfi Sigurdsson did latch onto a Llorente knockdown on 13 minutes but spooned an effort over the crossbar. Bournemouth were struggling to find their passing rhythm, but managed to open up Swansea on 31 minutes, which proved a big turning point in the game as they grabbed the opening goal. Leroy Fer was playing as a makeshift full-back for Swansea and his positional awareness was caught out as Marc Pugh released Afobe in a huge gap in behind. He took on the shot on from 20 yards, which was going wide of the post before Mawson's unfortunate intervention took it past Lukas Fabianski. Sigurdsson stung the fingertips of Artur Boruc from 35 yards five minutes later but clear cut chances were few and far between. Ryan Fraser and Dan Gosling both tested Fabianski from distance after the break as Bournemouth started to stamp their authority on the Swansea midfield. It looked as though the direct approach was the only way to really put the Cherries under pressure. A long ball into Llorente at the back post was headed across goal and only a brilliant intervention from Steve Cook denied Wayne Routledge a tap in. That proved to be a key moment in the match as 60 seconds later Afobe put his team in front. Jack Cork of Swansea City (left) and Bournemouth midfielder Jack Wilshere battle for possession Josh King found space in the pocket and threaded a lovely ball in behind a static Mawson for Afobe to stride through and finish into the far corner. Swansea had no answer and are slipping back towards deep trouble.

"2:51 Liverpool 2-1 Burnley Liverpool 2-1 Burnley Liverpool came from behind to beat Burnley 2-1 at Anfield and maintain their hopes of a top-four finish this season The away side took a seventh-minute lead through Ashley Barnes, but Georginio Wijnaldum equalised with the last kick of the first half and Emre Can hit a fine long-range goal in the second half to earn the victory for Jurgen Klopp's below-par side. Liverpool remain fourth, but with all of their top-six rivals in FA Cup action this weekend they are now just one point behind Tottenham and Manchester City - having played a game more - and five clear of fifth-placed Arsenal, who have two matches in hand. The final scoreline was perhaps harsh on a Burnley side who hadn't won a Premier League away game all season and dominated the first half. Ashley Barnes slid in to give Burnley the lead They claimed the lead through a high-quality goal with just seven minutes on the clock. Matt Lowton's brilliant low ball cut the Liverpool defence apart and a sliding Barnes prodded in at the far post. On his return from suspension, Barnes then volleyed narrowly wide from an offside position after Stephen Ward's brilliant cross opened up Liverpool's defence again, before Andre Gray flashed a shot over the bar from an acute angle. Burnley celebrate their seventh-minute opener With Roberto Firmino out injured, Klopp was forced to start Divock Origi and he narrowly failed to get his head on the end of Sadio Mane's cross in front of a frustrated Anfield. But with Burnley seconds away from going into the dressing room with a deserved lead, Wijnaldum struck an equaliser to turn the game on its head. Origi curled a cross from the left into the area and Wijnaldum's back-heeled volley fortuitously rebounded off Ben Mee back into his path and he hit a fierce shot past the returning Tom Heaton from near the penalty spot. Georginio Wijnaldum stayed calm in the area to equalise for Liverpool Liverpool took the lead just after the hour, but not before Klopp had made a big call by replacing underperforming playmaker Philippe Coutinho with 17-year-old Ben Woodburn. And seconds later Origi presented Can with the ball 25 yards from goal and he struck a sweet strike across Heaton - who perhaps should have done better - and in off the post to complete the turn-around. Mane might have added a third from inside the area in the final minute but Heaton tipped his effort over the bar before Lowton spurned a glorious chance for Burnley, who remain seven clear of danger in 12th, to claim a draw in injury time. The full-back latched on to a flicked header from Michael Keane, but let the ball bounce and lashed his shot over the bar from six yards Klopp will celebrate the result, if not the performance, as the top-four race intensifies further next Sunday as Liverpool travel to Manchester City live on Sky Sports. Burnley will visit Sunderland on Saturday afternoon still seeking their first league win on the road this season.

The striker's afternoon had not begun well after he missed an early penalty, with the Hammers immediately going up the other end of the pitch to open the scoring through Michail Antonio. However, King made up for that by equalising just past the half-hour mark, only for Benik Afobe to also miss from the spot six minutes later, before the Norwegian put the home side ahead three minutes after half-time. West Ham appeared to have stolen a point when substitute Andre Ayew scored with seven minutes to go, only for King to complete his treble in the 90th minute and give the hosts a vital victory. As a result, Eddie Howe's team remain six points clear of the relegation zone, while West Ham stay in 11th. The Cherries were without suspended duo Andrew Surman and Tyrone Mings after their fiery encounter at Old Trafford last weekend, but captain Simon Francis did start after overcoming a hamstring problem, while Dan Gosling was also recalled. West Ham, meanwhile, were boosted by the return from suspension of Antonio after a one-match ban, with the forward replacing Robert Snodgrass, who dropped down to the bench in their only change from Monday night's 2-1 home loss to Chelsea. Josh King (right) celebrates after giving his side a 2-1 lead against West Ham Bournemouth, looking for a first win in 10 matches, began the contest brightly, no doubt buoyed by their 1-1 draw at Old Trafford, and should have taken an early lead after Sofiane Feghouli felled Charlie Daniels in the box. But after referee Robert Madley had immediately pointed to the spot, King - who scored a penalty at United - casually side-footed wide of the right-hand post, with the Cherries finding themselves behind 48 seconds later. Harry Arter gifted the ball straight to Feghouli just outside his own area, with the Algerian then finding Antonio in the box and the forward did well to place a low shot past Atrur Boruc and into the bottom right-hand corner of the net for his ninth goal of the season and first in 10 games. The visitors were then fortunate not to have captain Mark Noble sent off after the midfielder - already on a yellow for protesting too much after the award of Bournemouth's penalty - lunged in recklessly at Dan Gosling. Josh King (right) celebrates with boss Eddie Howe (left) and Steve Cook after scoring his dramatic late winner against West Ham The Cherries deservedly drew level after a brilliant bit of skill by King, who in a tight space inside the box lifted the ball over Jose Fonte's head with his right foot, before planting a low shot past Randolph with his left. Incredibly, though, Bournemouth then spurned another wonderful chance to go ahead after Fonte was adjudged to have tripped Pugh in the box, only for Afobe - given penalty-taking duties this time in place of King - to shoot tamely at Randolph. That miss was soon forgotten as the home side finally took the lead at the start of the second period after Ryan Fraser's dinked free-kick somehow fell at the feet of the unmarked King, with the frontman making no mistake from six yards. Referee Madley did consult his assistant to ascertain if King was offside when either the set play was taken, or the ball was deflected into his path, with the duo coming to the right conclusion. Josh King (centre) nets his second goal three minutes into the second half But despite controlling most of the second period, Bournemouth looked to have thrown away the three points when Pedro Obiang's inch-perfect pass found the overlapping Sam Byram, whose cut back was tucked home by fellow substitute Ayew. The Cherries were not be denied, however, as Jack Wilshere caught Ayew in possession, with the substitute driving forward, before releasing Pugh to the left-hand byline. Pugh's pull back then found the on-loan Arsenal midfielder and despite Randolph keeping out his close-range strike, King was in the right place, at the right time, to fire high into the roof of the net to hand Bournemouth a much-needed win.

Everton 3-0 West Brom Everton 3-0 West Brom Romelu Lukaku scored his 19th Premier League goal of the season as Everton comfortably beat West Brom 3-0 at Goodison Park on Saturday. The striker, who spent a season on loan at Albion earlier in his career, had a hand in Everton's first two goals, helping to set up Kevin Mirallas' opener (39) before assisting Morgan Schneiderlin's strike on the stroke of half-time. Lukaku's header in the 82nd minute sealed the victory and puts him level with Tottenham forward Harry Kane at the top of the league's scoring chart. His tally of 19 league goals also marks the Belgium international's best return in a single campaign. Romelu Lukaku scored once and provided one assist against his former club The victory consolidates Everton's position in seventh, extending their lead over eighth-place West Brom to seven points. The Toffees are now two points behind Manchester United in sixth albeit having played two games more than Jose Mourinho's side. Tony Pulis, taking charge of his 300th Premier League game, made three changes from the 2-0 home defeat by Crystal Palace, while Everton made two alterations from their 3-2 loss at Tottenham. Everton boss Ronald Koeman said his side controlled the game in a dominant 3-0 win over West Brom Everton boss Ronald Koeman said his side controlled the game in a dominant 3-0 win over West Brom The hosts initially struggled to break down a stubborn Baggies defence, with Lukaku going closest before Mirallas opened the scoring. The former Chelsea striker dragged an early effort wide and also nodded past the post, but played his part when Everton did break the deadlock six minutes before half-time. His pass fortuitously picked out Ross Barkley and when Ben Foster failed to hold the England international's shot, Mirallas was on hand to finish from close range. Ronald Koeman's side doubled their lead in first-half stoppage time through Schneiderlin, who neatly lifted the ball over Foster after good work by Lukaku. It was the Frenchman's first top-flight goal for Everton and his first in the Premier League since he scored for Manchester United at Goodison Park 511 days ago. Morgan Schneiderlin of Everton celebrates scoring his first goal for the club Joel Robles kept out a firm strike by Nacer Chadli shortly after half-time but West Brom, who started Hal Robson-Kanu up front ahead of Salomon Rondon, failed to seriously trouble Everton's defence despite the withdrawal of Leighton Baines at the interval. The visitors were restricted to just two shots on target and conceded a third goal eight minutes from time when Barkley teed up an unmarked Lukaku to nod past Foster. Substitute Idrissa Gueye hit the post in stoppage time as Everton cruised to their fifth consecutive home win.

as Hull beat relegation rivals Swansea 2-1 at the KCOM Stadium. With the match seemingly heading to a goalless stalemate, Tigers boss Marco Silva introduced Niasse and was rewarded almost immediately with two quick-fire goals from the Senegalese striker. Alfie Mawson pulled one back for the visitors in the closing stages but the hosts held on for what could prove to be a crucial three points in the battle for Premier League survival. Swansea started the match the better of the two sides and almost took the lead inside the opening quarter of an hour when Wayne Routledge fired against Eldin Jakupovic's legs when presented with a clear sight of goal. Gylfi Sigurdsson and Fernando Llorente continued to cause the home defence problems but Swansea's forward momentum was halted when Angel Rangel was forced off with an injury midway through the first half. Niasse celebrates after putting the Tigers ahead at the KCOM Stadium Hull began to grow into the match and came agonisingly close to breaking the deadlock when Lukas Fabianski brilliantly cleared Kamil Grosicki's lob off the line with Abel Hernandez ready to pounce. Paul Clement was forced into a second change shortly before the break when Llorente limped off after a collision with Tom Huddlestone. The Senegalese striker is enjoying a successful loan spell at Hull from parent club Everton Swansea recovered well from that set-back and should have moved in front after the interval when Routledge blazed a shot high over the bar from eight yards out when it looked easier to score. However, the visitors were then made to pay when Niasse, brought on as a second-half substitute for Alfred N'Diaye, put Hull ahead with a composed finish under Fabianski after a neat one-two with Hernandez. Alfie Mawson pulled one back in the closing stages but Swansea were unable to find a late equaliser The Senegalese striker doubled the home side's advantage with a close-range finish after Mawson allowed a bouncing ball to slip through his legs. Although the Swansea defender responded for the visitors with a well-directed header in the final minutes, Hull held on to claim a crucial victory at home.

Pep Guardiola's side were looking to close the gap on leaders Chelsea to eight points but remain in third place, behind Tottenham on goal difference, after a game of few clear opportunities at the Etihad Stadium. Substitutes David Silva and Kelechi Iheanacho missed good chances in the final 20 minutes but Stoke, who remain ninth on 36 points, deserved a point for a determined away display. Man-of-the-match Ryan Shawcross felt Stoke executed the pre-match plan perfectly Man-of-the-match Ryan Shawcross felt Stoke executed the pre-match plan perfectly Manchester City - without the rested Raheem Sterling - lacked urgency in a first half which actually saw the away side produce the best chances. Stoke were 4-0 down to Tottenham at half-time in their last away game, but would have deservedly led at the Etihad Stadium had Willy Caballero not been alert to deny Mame Biram Diouf's scuffed shot from Erik Pieters' sixth-minute cross or if Bruno Martins Indi had connected more cleanly with Jonathan Walters' free-kick. Saido Berahino, who lasted 79 minutes on his first start for Stoke following his January move from West Brom, had the first chance of the second half, collecting the ball from Walters' header before his effort was blocked by Nicolas Otamendi. Sergio Aguero made his first meaningful contribution 10 minutes after the break when his shot from the edge of the penalty area was headed over by Pieters before Guardiola threw on Silva for Jesus Navas as he sought inspiration in the final 35 minutes. It had an impact as the Spaniard started a move which saw Kevin De Bruyne's cross turned over the bar by Leroy Sane and another which resulted in Yaya Toure blasting wastefully over from the edge of the area. The home side went close on 70 minutes when De Bruyne fizzed in a low cross to the near post and Aguero nudged it across the goal and wide, under pressure from Ryan Shawcross. And they went even closer a minute later when Silva played a neat one-two with Fernandinho just inside the area and drilled a left-footed shot just wide of Lee Grant's left upright. Silva's corner was headed onto the roof of the net by Otamendi and Aguero shot into the side-netting, before substitute Iheanacho volleyed a glorious chance wide of the post in injury time. Sane failed to get onto the end of another De Bruyne added-time cross as Manchester City were forced to settle for a frustrating point and another blow to their slim Premier League title hopes. They will now turn their attentions to the FA Cup quarter-final at Middlesbrough on Saturday, while Stoke have 10 days off to recover before they host Chelsea in the Premier League.

10 points clear at the top of the Premier League table after a 2-1 win at West Ham on Monday Night Football. A flowing counter-attack was expertly finished by Eden Hazard on 25 minutes at the London Stadium and the visitors doubled the score when Diego Costa capitalised on poor West Ham defending to turn home Cesc Fabregas' corner. A stoppage-time strike by Manuel Lanzini reduced the deficit but it came too late for the Hammers to stage a comeback as Chelsea held on to extend their lead atop the table. Antonio Conte's side are now 10 points ahead of second-place Tottenham and 11 clear of Manchester City, who could cut that advantage to eight with victory over Stoke, live on Sky Sports on Wednesday. Chelsea welcome Manchester United to Stamford Bridge next in their FA Cup quarter-final on Monday. West Ham remain 11th and travel to Bournemouth on Saturday in the Premier League. Andy Carroll replaced the suspended Michail Antonio in Slaven Bilic's only change from the 1-1 draw at Watford. The England striker typified the Hammers' effort in the first half, crashing into aerial challenges and drawing blood after one particularly firm collision with Victor Moses. Eden Hazard (centre) turns away after scoring Chelsea's first goal against West Ham But the hosts were undone by the game's first moment of attacking quality as Chelsea, who were unchanged from their 3-1 win over Swansea, took the lead with their first shot of the match. The break was led by the irrepressible N'Golo Kante, who won possession and sent Hazard clear. The Belgian exchanged passes with Pedro before skipping around Darren Randolph and sliding in his 11th goal of the season. Lanzini, making his 50th Premier League appearance, lashed over as West Ham looked to respond before half-time but their opponents went closest with a flurry of chances. Moses and Pedro were denied by Aaron Cresswell and Randolph respectively after Costa had wasted a promising chance created by Hazard. The Spain striker made no mistake shortly after the break, converting off his thigh from a Fabregas delivery. A miscommunication at the front post between Carroll and Pedro Obiang allowed Costa to steal in for his 49th Premier League goal since joining Chelsea, and his 17th of the season. Diego Costa turns home from close range against West Ham West Ham's first effort on target came after 61 minutes when Sofiane Feghouli fired past Thibaut Courtois only for Moses to clear on the line. It was a difficult night overall for the Hammers, who lost Winston Reid to injury midway through the second half and expended plenty of energy against a well-drilled Chelsea back three. The visitors almost grabbed a third through Costa on the break but a fantastic fingertip stop by Randolph denied the striker. A spell of late West Ham pressure finally yielded reward for the hosts when Lanzini rifled low past Courtois in the 92nd minute but Chelsea saw out time in the closing stages.

scored twice as Tottenham beat Everton 3-2 in an entertaining Premier League encounter at White Hart Lane on Nissan Super Sunday. Kane's brilliant 25-yard strike put Tottenham ahead after 20 minutes in a first-half they dominated, while Victor Wanyama also hit the post. England international Kane scored his 19th goal of the season 11 minutes after the break, finishing low past Joel Robles after the hosts capitalised on some woeful Everton defending. Kane scored his second of the game in the second half Romelu Lukaku halved the deficit with nine minutes remaining, finishing well after Jan Verthonghen's slip, but Dele Alli made it 3-1 with a neat flick after being found unmarked by Harry Winks in the second minute of stoppage time. Enner Valencia immediately pulled one back for Everton during a frantic finish, but Spurs held on for their ninth straight Premier League victory at White Hart Lane. The result means Spurs are seven points off leaders Chelsea, who go to West Ham on Monday Night Football, while Everton are seventh, five points off sixth. Spurs were unchanged after their 4-0 win over Stoke last weekend, while Gareth Barry replaced Ademola Lookman for Everton following the 2-0 victory over Sunderland. Tottenham players celebrate the opener at White Hart Lane After a steady start, Spurs took the lead out of nothing through Kane, who fired superbly into the left corner past Robles from 25 yards after finding space. Then came a flurry of Spurs chances; first Kane forced Robles into a fine block from close range after turning Seamus Coleman in the box, before Christian Eriksen poked an effort just wide after Mousa Dembele had slipped him through. Spurs then hit the post through Wanyama's deflected effort as the ball fell to him kindly outside the area, but Everton made it to half-time without further damage. Robles was equal to Dele Alli's placed header after the restart as chances continued to fall for Spurs, and again the Everton stopper had to be alert to Vertonghen's fierce effort after a mazy run moments later. Romelu Lukaku halved the deficit for Everton with nine minutes remaining Everton shot themselves in the foot on 56 minutes to hand Kane a second after Robles put Morgan Schneiderlin under pressure with a throw out. The Frenchman lost out to Alli, who played Kane through on goal, and the England striker rolled it past Robles for 2-0. Despite feeding off scraps for almost the entire game, with nine minutes remaining Lukaku capitalised on Verthonghen's slip to fire into the bottom corner with his right foot from 15 yards. The goal means the 23-year-old is now clear as Everton's Premier League top goalscorer with 61 goals, ahead of Duncan Ferguson. Kane nearly had the chance for his hat-trick just moments later, but Robles saved from close range as the striker attempted to lift the ball over him. Kane and Deli Alli showed off a well-rehearsed celebration after the opener, reproduced by Graeme Souness and Jamie Redknapp in the Super Sunday studio... Kane and Deli Alli showed off a well-rehearsed celebration after the opener, reproduced by Graeme Souness and Jamie Redknapp in the Super Sunday studio...

Sunderland, who are now six points adrift from safety, saw Jermain Defoe hit the post in the first half, but City went into the break ahead after Aguero turned home a close-range opener on 42 minutes. Aguero, who was dropped by Pep Guardiola earlier this year for new signing Gabriel Jesus, has now scored five goals in his last three games following the Brazilian's injury in mid-February. Aguero celebrates the opener with his team-mates In-form Leroy Sane then hit the second on 59 minutes to all-but kill the game off after a fine City move having been played through by man-of-the-match David Silva. The result means City are up to third, eight points behind Chelsea, who have played the same amount of games but go to West Ham on Monday Night Football. David Moyes named an unchanged Sunderland side for the first time in the Premier League this season, while City brought back five players following their FA Cup replay win over Huddersfield in midweek. Leroy Sane gets into the penalty area in the first half Sunderland went closest early on through Defoe, who hit the foot of the post from range before Fabio Borini headed the rebound wide of Willy Cabellero's goal. Caballero was then at his best to save from Billy Jones' downward header from a Seb Larsson corner, while at the other end, Silva was inches away from converting Sane's centre from the left. Jones again went close with a header, this time knocking it just wide from another Larsson corner, before City took the lead with three minutes of the half remaining. Sane wheels away in celebration after the second Getting on the end of Raheem Sterling's deflected cross, Aguero flicked the ball beyond Jordan Pickford for his 12th league goal of the season, and his seventh in all competitions since the turn of the year. It was 2-0 just before the hour mark from a blistering City move as Sane finished with his left foot off the inside of the post after Silva had played the German through on the left of the area. Caballero stood firm moments later from Larsson's drilled effort from an acute angle, and Adnan Januzaj glanced a free header wide, while sub Kevin De Bruyne fired just over late on. Aguero nearly netted his second at the death, but Pickford saved superbly from the Argentine's left-footed effort from 20 yards. City are back in action on Wednesday night when they host Stoke in the Premier League, a game you can see live on Sky Sports 1 HD from 7.30pm.

After Joshua King's penalty cancelled out Marcos Rojo's 23rd-minute opener, there were two flash points before half time as Tyrone Mings stamped on the head of Ibrahimovic, and the Swede responded shortly afterwards by elbowing the defender as they competed at a corner. Neither player was punished by referee Kevin Friend and instead Bournemouth's Andrew Surman was shown a second yellow card for pushing Ibrahimovic in the melee that followed.

Tyrone Mings insists stamping is not part of his game after clashing with Zlatan Ibrahimovic at Old Trafford Tyrone Mings insists stamping is not part of his game after clashing with Zlatan Ibrahimovic at Old Trafford The result is a set-back to United's top-four ambitions as it leaves them sixth in the table. Zlatan Ibrahimovic caught Tyrone Mings with an elbow The frustration that Manchester United showed at the final whistle was a far cry from the pre-match positivity as Luke Shaw and Wayne Rooney made their first starts since October and December respectively. Marcos Rojo gave Manchester United the lead For Bournemouth it was pre-match uncertainty as manager Eddie Howe was expected to miss the game through illness, but ended up in the dugout after travelling to Old Trafford separately. If Howe was still feeling under the weather, his mood would not have been lifted by his side's showing in the opening 20 minutes as they looked fragile defensively. Andrew Surman is shown a red card by referee Kevin Friend Rooney headed over the bar before Paul Pogba was denied by Boruc, and Ibrahimovic failed to turn in a pass across goal. Benik Afobe spurned a great chance at the other end when he slipped after being played through on goal, but otherwise it was United who dominated, with Boruc twice saving from Anthony Martial. The breakthrough eventually arrived in the 23rd minute as Rojo turned in Valencia's shot. Ibrahimovic missed a penalty against Bournemouth But the hosts could not add to their advantage and instead it was Bournemouth who drew level before the break when Jones brought down Pugh and King converted the resulting penalty. After Ibrahimovic and Rooney were denied by Boruc, there was controversy late in the first half as Mings stamped on the head of the former Sweden international, and he then elbowed the defender as they went up for a header. Wayne Rooney says Man United are extremely disappointed following their 1-1 draw against Bournemouth Wayne Rooney says Man United are extremely disappointed following their 1-1 draw against Bournemouth The referee took his time to make a decision, with the end result that Surman was sent off for a second yellow for pushing Ibrahimovic. Anthony Martial was unable to find a way past Artur Boruc With the man advantage, United controlled the second half and, after Boruc saved from Pogba, the hosts were presented with a chance to regain the lead as Adam Smith was penalised for handball in the box. But Ibrahimovic saw his penalty well kept out by Boruc, with the former Southampton goalkeeper saving low to his right. Bournemouth equalised before half time Harry Arter escaped a second yellow card after catching Pogba with a sliding tackle as Bournemouth held firm. The hosts did not create another chance until injury-time when Pogba swiped wide from close range, and the final whistle was greeted by celebrations from Bournemouth players as United were left frustrated.

Leicester's revival since the sacking of Claudio Ranieri continued under caretaker manager Craig Shakespeare, who strengthened his own claims to get manager's job on a full-time basis. But they did have to come from behind after Sam Clucas' 14th minute opener. The hosts, inspired by the impressive Jamie Vardy, levelled the scores through Christian Fuchs before Mahrez struck in the 59th minute to score for the first time in the league in open play in 28 matches. Tom Huddlestone's own goal in the 90th minute secured all three points for Leicester, who stay 15th and move five points clear of the relegation zone after successive 3-1 wins. Riyad Mahrez (R) celebrates scoring his side's second goal with Danny Drinkwater (L) Hull stay 19th, four points adrift of safety as their fight to stay in the top-flight continues. Leicester, buoyed by Monday's win over Liverpool, went with the same side that picked up all three points against Jurgen Klopp's side. They continued in the same vein with Vardy at the heart of things. The England international fired a cross into the six-yard box for Marc Albrighton, but a combination of Andrew Robertson and Harry Maguire managed to turn the ball behind. Leicester City's Jamie Vardy (R) and Hull City's Andrea Ranocchia battle for the ball Leicester continued to create chances and Robert Huth had the best of them after Fuchs' long thrown fell to him in the penalty area but his shot was blocked expertly blocked by Maguire. Despite the home side's dominance, they were behind in the 14th minute after a swift Hull counter-attack. Kamil Grosicki broke quickly and pulled the ball back for Clucas, who turned the ball home from close range. Leiceter were back on terms in the 28th minute and Vardy was heavily involved again in a move started and finished by Fuchs. The Austrian linked up brilliantly with Vardy down the flank, playing a couple of one-twos before continuing his run into the area where he was on hand to finish off Vardy's cut back from 10 yards out. Christian Fuchs (L) celebrates Leicester's equaliser After the break, Hull almost took the lead with Maguire making a nuisance of himself in attack. The defender stuck a boot out to meet a corner but saw his effort clip the outside of the post and shortly afterwards Kasper Schmeichel comfortably saved another Maguire effort from a Grosicki delivery. At the other end, Eldin Jakupovic then kept out a tame effort from Mahrez just before the hour, but the Algeria international wasn't to be denied for long. Sam Clucasgave Hull the lead Mahrez turned Robertson inside out on the edge of the penalty area to create an opening for a shot and, after cutting back for the third time, he found the bottom corner, but Jakupovic should have done better. Hull tried to respond immediately and Schmeichel acrobatically punched Grosicki's free-kick away before blocking an effort from Oumar Niasse at his near post with six minutes remaining. Jakupovic then denied substitute Demarai Gray before Leicester sealed victory in the final minute when Onyinye Ndidi's header struck Huddlestone and flew into the net.

The game was hinged on a 13-minute spell in the first half, where the Austria international's fourth and fifth Premier League goals of the season put the game beyond Boro. The Teessiders, who have now not scored in the league since January 31, rarely looked capable of hauling themselves back into contention as their wait for a league win stretched to 10 games. As a result, Boro drop into the relegation zone, three points from safety, while Stoke, who atoned for last week's hammering at Tottenham, climb a place to ninth. Glen Johnson and Geoff Cameron - making his first start since October - returned for Stoke while Aitor Karanka made five changes to the Boro side which lost at Crystal Palace. One of those alterations, left-back George Friend endured a testing return after a five-week injury lay-off, with the Potters asking questions on his return. Marko Arnautovic scored a classy opener against Middlesbrough at the bet365 Stadium The hosts had a lot of joy down the right in the opening exchanges, Peter Crouch and Joe Allen combining to release Arnautovic on 14 minutes. He then delivered a cross into the six-yard box with so much pace that all Ramadan Sobhi could do was to send it crashing against the crossbar. That was the only piece of real quality in the first half until Stoke hit the front thanks to the brilliance of Arnautovic shortly before the half hour. Marko Arnautovic wheels away after taking his Premier League tally to five Having evaded the offside trap, the forward's deft touch saw him control Glenn Whelan's long ball and knock it around Friend, before he rounded Victor Valdes and drilled home. For the second, Arnautovic reacted quickest to Crouch's knock-down from a corner, swivelling converting from close range three minutes before the interval. Karanka tried to freshen Boro up at the break by bringing on Cristhian Stuani, and the visitors posed a greater threat as the half wore on. Joe Allen and Kevin Friend tussle at the bet365 Stadium They had the ball in the back of the net on the hour, Ben Gibson firing the loose ball home from close range, but Bernardo was penalised for offside in the build-up. Valdes' fine individual display prevented Stoke from running amok as the Spaniard thwarted Sobhi's late header and substitute Ibrahim Afellay in stoppage-time. Either side of those, the hosts saw a claim for a penalty ignored by referee Craig Pawson after Gibson appeared to block Allen's goal-bound strike with his arm. Ben Gibson's second-half effort was ruled out for offside But the decision proved immaterial as Stoke ran out resounding winners to pile the pressure on Karanka's men.

Llorente opened the scoring in the 12th minute before Andre Gray equalised eight minutes later with a controversial penalty. Gray scored again on the hour-mark to put Burnley ahead but the lead was short lived as Martin Olsson equalised for the hosts before Llorente headed the winner deep into injury time. Martin Olsson scored Swansea's second goal The result means Swansea move five points clear of the relegation zone in 16th, while Burnley drop to 12th. There was just one change for Swansea to the team that lost to Chelsea last weekend. Luciano Narsingh came into the side for Wayne Routledge to make his first Premier League start. Swansea manager Paul Clement believes Burnley can still be dragged back into the Premier League relegation battle ahead of their match on Saturday Swansea manager Paul Clement believes Burnley can still be dragged back into the Premier League relegation battle ahead of their match on Saturday For Burnley, Jeff Hendrick returned from his three-match ban in place of Ashley Westwood while Tom Heaton was forced to miss out through illness, meaning Paul Robinson stepped in. Swansea had already hit the woodwork twice through Alfie Mawson before Llorente gave them a deserved lead. Leroy Fer sprinted down the right flank and past Robbie Brady before curling a cross in for the Spaniard, who powered his header past a helpless Robinson for his 10th goal of the season. Sean Dyche gives his post-match reaction to Burnley's 3-2 defeat to Swansea at the Liberty Stadium Sean Dyche gives his post-match reaction to Burnley's 3-2 defeat to Swansea at the Liberty Stadium Burnley's equaliser would come in controversial circumstances. George Boyd's corner evaded everybody before striking the hand of Burnley forward Sam Bokes. However, referee Anthony Taylor awarded Sean Dyche's side a penalty which Gray converted down the middle. Swansea 3-2 Burnley Moments later, Sigurdsson was unfortunate with a strike 25 yards from goal which went just wide of Robinson's left post. The rest of the opening 45 minutes would see Robinson forced into making a string of saves. First from Olsson before he then had to tip wide Sigurdsson's free-kick on the stroke of half-time. The second half began with Swansea dominating proceedings with Sigurdsson almost sneaking an effort in at the far post but Ben Mee was able to clear off the line. With Swansea continually pumping crosses into the box and sending more numbers forward, it was Burnley who took a surprise lead. A long ball from Keane was headed on by Vokes for Gray in the box who chested the ball down, swivelled and with his left foot struck the ball into the bottom right for his second of the match. Andre Gray scored Burnley's controversial penalty to level the match But nine minutes later, Swansea got their equaliser. Olsson burst forward from deep and passed to Sigurdsson, who completely deceived Burnley's defence with a back-heel back to the Sweden international who smashed his strike into the top left corner. Swansea would see another chance cleared off the line by Mee in the 89th minute with Carroll unable to convert after a goalmouth scramble. Llorente opened the scoring for Swansea in the ninth minute Finally Swansea's persistence did pay off. A great cross from Carroll on the left was swung towards the far post for Llorente, who rose above Mee and nodded his effort into the top left corner. Swansea boss Paul Clement ran down the touchline after securing a significant win. But for Burnley, their quest for their first away win of the season continues.

Vicarage Road on Saturday. Troy Deeney volleyed Watford into an early lead before goals from Dusan Tadic and Redmond put Southampton 2-1 up at half-time. Stefano Okaka drew the hosts level in the 79th minute before Manolo Gabbiadini pounced on a Heurelho Gomes error four minutes later. Redmond then scored his second to put the game beyond Watford, despite Abdoulaye Doucoure's goal in the final minute. Victory lifts Southampton into the top half of the Premier League table, while Watford move down to 13th. Nathan Redmond (L) and Dusan Tadic were both on the scoresheet for Southampton It was the perfect start for the hosts as Deeney flicked on Younes Kaboul's long throw for Okaka before latching onto the return ball with a finely-taken volley into the far corner after four minutes. Southampton grew into the game after going a goal down and Gomes was forced to tip Tadic's effort round the post before getting down low to deny Gabbiadini. An end-to-end half then saw Okaka spurn two headers from Jose Holebas' crosses before Etienne Capoue's long-distance effort trickled narrowly wide of the mark. The Saints were level in the 28th-minute through Tadic, who started the attack before latching onto the loose ball inside the box and slotting into the bottom corner. Troy Deeney volleyed Watford into an early lead In the second minute of added time the visitors went ahead following a fine team move, with Redmond rounding it off from 12 yards out. After the break, Gomes came to the rescue twice to keep Watford's hopes alive, first producing a flying save to tip away Tadic's volley before getting down low to deny Maya Yoshida's close-range effort. Watford equalised with just over 10 minutes to go when Okaka turned the ball home following Isaac Success' low cross. The score was level for just four minutes however, as Gomes spilled a Sofiane Boufal effort, with Gabbiadini poking the ball home. Redmond then found himself in acres of space down the left, and with Sebastian Prodl backing away, his effort proved too strong for Gomes. There was still time for a Doucoure consolation, but the Saints held on to provide the perfect tonic for their supporters following last weekend's heartache in the EFL Cup final.

Following a first half lacking in chances, Wilfried Zaha gave the visitors the lead 10 minutes after the break, firing home from 12 yards after taking the ball down on his chest from a Yohan Cabaye ball. Andros Townsend got Palace's second in superb style, showing great stamina to pick the ball up in his own half, pile into the area and find the near post from 12 yards out. The result means Palace are up to 17th, and are now three points clear of the drop zone after their third win in five games, while West Brom stay eighth, nine points off the top six. Both sides were unchanged following victories in the Premier League last weekend, and though the intensity was high in the first half, chances were at a premium. Salomon Rondon and Bakary Sako battle for possession The only opportunity of the first 45 minutes fell to Crystal Palace's Christian Benteke, who saw his unmarked header from a Cabaye corner cleared off the line by Chris Brunt. West Brom, managed by former Palace boss Tony Pulis, did appeal for a penalty after Cayabe looked to trip Salomon Rondon, but referee Mike Jones rightly waved play on. Palace scored out of nowhere through Zaha on 55 minutes, who superbly chested the ball beyond Brunt from Cayabe's ball and fired past Ben Foster with a fierce left-footed effort into the bottom corner from 12 yards. Zaha nearly had a second moments later having got between two West Brom defenders and through on goal, but Foster rushed out to dispossess, before Jason Puncheon poked the ball wide on the rebound. James Tomkins celebrates in front of the following Palace fans Foster was at it again with 10 minutes remaining, denying Townsend after he was put through one-on-one by Luka Milivojevic, but the winger earned Palace a superb second with six minutes remaining. Picking the ball up in his own half, Townsend shook off a challenge before getting into the area and firing into the bottom corner from an angle. Palace goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey was rarely tested throughout the clash, and Palace thoroughly deserved the three points in their fight against relegation.

The Gunners, who started Alexis Sanchez on the bench for tactical reasons, were 2-0 down at half-time after goals by Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane. Sanchez, on as a half-time substitute, set up Danny Welbeck to reduce the deficit but a stoppage-time strike by Georginio Wijnaldum sealed victory for Liverpool. They move up to third having played two games more than fourth-placed Manchester City, who face Sunderland on Nissan Super Sunday. Arsenal drop to fifth and take on Bayern Munich next in the Champions League last-16 on Tuesday trailing 5-1 on aggregate from the first leg. The win means Liverpool are now unbeaten in their nine league games this season against the current top six. Jurgen Klopp made one change from Monday's 3-1 defeat by Leicester City, shuffling his defence as Ragnar Klavan replaced Lucas Leiva. Roberto Firmino put Liverpool ahead in the first half Wenger, without Mesut Ozil due to illness, raised eyebrows by naming Sanchez on the bench and the Gunners managed just one shot on target in a lethargic first-half display. They fell behind when Firmino converted Liverpool's first chance of the match, hammering high into the net from Mane's cross. The hosts' famed pressing, absent against the Foxes, kept Arsenal penned inside their own half and Klopp's side deservedly doubled their lead before the break. Firmino was again involved, teeing up Mane at the back post after good work by James Milner and Wijnaldum. The Senegal international took a touch to compose himself and smashed his low strike past Petr Cech. Danny Welbeck pulled one back for Arsenal after half-time The Reds almost made it three on the stroke of half-time through Philippe Coutinho, who had earlier drawn a smart save from the Arsenal goalkeeper. He should have done better when Lallana's deflected pass fell fortuitously into his path but the Brazilian miscued his shot straight at Cech. Wenger introduced Sanchez at the interval and the Chilean made an immediate impact, providing the pass for Welbeck to lift his finish over Simon Mignolet after 57 minutes. Mignolet had made a fine save from Olivier Giroud's header prior to the goal and the Liverpool 'keeper was on hand to gather when the Frenchman's effort then came off the crossbar. Georginio Wijnaldum scores Liverpool's third goal in injury time Arsenal pressed in the closing stages and Emre Can was fortunate to avoid a second yellow card for his late tackle on Theo Walcott, but Liverpool remained a threat to score a third. They went close when substitute Divock Origi rose well to meet a Milner free-kick but the forward's header came off the base of the post. Liverpool did wrap up victory in stoppage time with a quick break as Arsenal searched in vain for an equaliser. Joel Matip blocked Sanchez's goal-bound effort and Liverpool counter-attacked through Lallana, who found Origi with the Belgian in turn teeing up Wijnaldum to sweep home. Liverpool face Burnley next Sunday live on Sky Sports, while Arsenal follow their game against Bayern with an FA Cup quarter-final against non-league Lincoln City at the Emirates on Saturday.

hammering Liverpool 3-1 on Monday Night Football. Jamie Vardy's first Premier League goals since December 10 and Danny Drinkwater's sensational volley handed the beleaguered champions their first victory since New Year's Eve, as interim boss Craig Shakespeare got his tenure off to a winning start. Despite easing their relegation fears - Leicester now 15th, two points clear of the bottom three - the victory asks serious questions of the Foxes, who rekindled the spirit of their title-winning season so soon after Ranieri was relieved of his duties. For as good as Leicester were, Liverpool were as bad, Philippe Coutinho's second-half strike mere consolation as the Reds' top-four challenge faltered. It was clear from the start Leicester were keen to prove a point after Ranieri's shock dismissal, the Foxes producing a first-half display befitting of their title-winning campaign under the Italian. Vardy's crunching tackle on Sadio Mane in the opening minute set the tone, and was quickly followed by Wilfred Ndidi lashing an early volley over as the reinvigorated champions set about Liverpool. Robert Huth and Shinji Okazaki called Simon Mignolet into action with headers before the German, unmarked in the area, flashed a header over on the quarter-hour mark. Liverpool should have fallen behind on 20 minutes but Vardy, having been played in behind by Marc Albrighton, sliced a volley straight at Mignolet. Vardy did get the better of Mignolet eight minutes later, though, out-sprinting Lucas Leiva to gather Albrighton's incisive pass before slotting past the Reds goalkeeper at his near post. Drinkwater connects sweetly to score his first goal of the season Liverpool offered little in terms of a response, Georginio Wijnaldum firing straight at Kasper Schmeichel in the 33rd minute, before Vardy's belligerence presented Ndidi with the chance to double Leicester's lead, but Mignolet saved. However, the Belgian was helpless to prevent Drinkwater's 39th-minute thunderbolt from the edge of the area from flying into the back of the net as Leicester doubled their advantage before the interval. Having failed to register a single shot on target in the first period, Jurgen Klopp clearly got into his underperforming side during the break - and they responded, with Coutinho calling Schmeichel into action on 54 minutes. Danny Drinkwater wheels away in celebration after his stunning volley But their hopes of a comeback were extinguished on the hour as Riyad Mahrez and Christian Fuchs combined brilliantly to set up Vardy, who glanced home his second. Adam Lallana stung Schmeichel's palms five minutes later before Coutinho rounded off the visitors' best move of the game to reduce the arrears, slotting home after combining with Emre Can on 68 minutes. Fragile under Ranieri for most of the season, Leicester displayed their new-found mettle to prevent Liverpool from hauling themselves back into the game. Philippe Coutinho's second-half strike was mere consolation for Liverpool Lucas spurned a glorious chance to apply some pressure on 81 minutes, but he headed Nathaniel Clyne's cross wide. Coutinho's volley three minutes from time proved too hot for Schmeichel to handle but fortune favour the Foxes as it spilled wide, leaving the fans to greet the full-time whistle with cries of 'we are staying up'.

The in-form striker netted all three goals inside 37 minutes, before setting up Dele Alli for a fourth in the final moments of the opening period, as Spurs won their eight consecutive league game at White Hart Lane. The Potters offered very little in terms of response - their best chance coming from Peter Crouch before the break - and remain tenth in the table. Tottenham move up to second above Manchester City - who did not play this weekend - although they remain 10 points behind leaders Chelsea. Harry Kane scored his third hat-trick in nine games during the 4-0 victory Both managers named unchanged sides for their last outings - Stoke in the Premier League and Tottenham from their Europa League exit in midweek - but the hosts certainly shook off their disappointment from Thursday's match in a sublime opening 45 minutes. It took Kane 14 minutes to grab his first goal of the game, which also brought up his century of club goals. The ball fell to the striker after Ryan Shawcross' clearance from the feet of Christian Eriksen, Kane firing low past Lee Grant. Kane scored his hat-trick goal from a free kick Stoke had their best chance of the game in the 25th minute as Crouch got on the end of an Erik Pieters cross, but it was saved by Hugo Lloris at point-blank range, while Jan Vertonghen rattled the woodwork soon after. Kane curled a fantastic effort just past the top corner but his wait for another goal didn't last long. Eriksen picked out his team-mate with a curling corner and Kane hit a fine half-volley through the legs of Victor Wanyama to double the hosts' lead with 32 minutes gone. Toby Alderweireld was taken off injured early in the second half Five minutes later, Kane completed his third hat-trick in nine games. After Alli was once again clipped by Charlie Adam, it was Eriksen and Kane who lurked over a free-kick with the former tapping it into the path of the striker who thumped the ball towards goal (37). It took a big deflection off the heel of Crouch, but it was heading into the back of the net nonetheless and Kane peeled away to celebrate. Kane rounded off a marvellous opening period with an assist as he powered forward in the first minute of two added on, sliding the ball into the path of an unmarked Alli, who bounced back from his red card against Gent and slotted home to round off a mesmerising first half performance. Dele Alli celebrates scoring Tottenham's fourth goal The second period was a much quieter affair, although it did not begin on the best note for Spurs as Toby Alderweireld was taken off with a suspected groin strain within the opening five minutes. It took 12 minutes for Tottenham to have their first shot of the half as a short corner was whipped into the box by Eriksen, searching for the on-running Kane at the back post, but it just went over his head with the striker clattering into the upright in the process. Kane celebrates his hat-trick with team-mate Kyle Walker Grant continued to be tested and pulled off some fine saves to deny Spurs a fifth goal. The Stoke stopper got down low in the 62nd minute to keep out a nick from Eric Dier on an Eriksen free kick, before denying Kane another strike 12 minutes later, again getting to the floor to keep out his fierce drive from the top of the box. Stoke attempted to make some forays forward as the game wore on but never truly tested the Tottenham defence, with Grant once again saving the visitors from further embarrassment with five minutes of the game to play as he kept out an effort from Walker but it was not needed as Spurs cruised to victory.

Cesc Fabregas' strike on his 300th league appearance (19) set the leaders on their way, although it took late goals from Pedro and Diego Costa to get the job done after Fernando Llorente headed an equaliser in first-half stoppage time. Swansea may point - with some justification - to an unpunished Cesar Azpilicueta handball in his own penalty box with the score at 1-1, referee Neil Swarbrick apparently ruling the close-quarters contact accidental. But Chelsea were good value for a welcome win after twice dropping points in their past three matches, and they might have won by more as Fabregas alone came close to a hat-trick during a rare 90 minutes under Antonio Conte. Diego Costa made the game safe with a volleyed third A sixth start in this season's Premier League made him the first Spanish member of the competition's 300 club, and he took his landmark appearance as an opportunity to showcase his enduring class. Fabregas played the midfield metronome role with customary measure - as much tick-tock as tiki-taka - splintered his short passing with the odd well-aimed slingshot into the runs of his front three, and caused Swansea countless problems with ambitious late arrivals in their box. Chelsea boss Antonio Conte says his side need 29 more points to win the title after what he called a deserved win against Swansea. Chelsea boss Antonio Conte says his side need 29 more points to win the title after what he called a deserved win against Swansea. One such run brought the opener as a Pedro pass aimed at Costa was quickly brought under control and prodded into the far corner with Lukasz Fabianski still setting himself. Fabianski denied his old Arsenal team-mate a second shortly afterwards and later stood spectating as Fabregas' firm side-footer rebounded off his crossbar. Cesc Fabregas reacts after scoring on his 300th Premier League appearance By that stage the game was level. Somehow. Swansea manager Paul Clement, returning to the club where he won the title as Carlo Ancelotti's assistant, had called the trip a \"shot to nothing\" for Swansea, but they registered naught in the shots column until the final few seconds of the first half when Gylfi Sigurdsson's flat free-kick was met by Llorente as Chelsea's defenders left it to each other. Had the game finished even there might have been words about the legitimacy of the free-kick - dubiously awarded against N'Golo Kante - but Swansea had a complaint of their own when Azpilicueta's outstretched arm blocked Sigurdsson's flick after the break. Swansea boss Paul Clement believes his side should have had a penalty with the score at 1-1 but admitted Chelsea deserved to win. Swansea boss Paul Clement believes his side should have had a penalty with the score at 1-1 but admitted Chelsea deserved to win. The moment passed and Chelsea exacted full toll. Fabianski, who had outdone his first-half stop from Fabregas with a better one to deny Eden Hazard, was at fault as he dived over a Pedro curler (72) which was decent but no more. And the game was up when Costa slammed in Hazard's cut-back on the volley (84) for a 16th league goal, Swansea slipping to a third league defeat of Clement's promising tenure that leaves them three points above the relegation places with an overdue run of four bottom-half opponents to come.

"2:44 Crystal Palace 1-0 Middlesbrough Crystal Palace 1-0 Middlesbrough Patrick van Aanholt scored his first goal for Crystal Palace as they sealed a vital 1-0 victory over relegation rivals Middlesbrough on Saturday afternoon. The defender volleyed home in the 34th minute to give Sam Allardyce just his second Premier League victory since becoming Eagles manager, moving them up to 17th place. Boro's lack of cutting edge in the league continued at Selhurst Park as they rarely threatened the Palace goal, and remain one point and two places above the bottom three - level with their hosts on 22 points. Allardyce made three changes from the 1-0 defeat to Stoke two weeks ago, handing a debut to Liverpool loanee Mamadou Sakho, while Aitor Karanka opted to started with three centre-backs after a number of his full-backs were absent due to injury. Crystal Palace defender Patrick van Aanholt (right) celebrates scoring a goal against Middlesbrough Crystal Palace could have been awarded a penalty inside seven minutes when Wilfried Zaha powered down the left wing and went to ground after a tackle from Daniel Ayala. He instantly appealed for a spot-kick but referee Bobby Madley waved away the claims, although replays showed he was pushed off the ball. Crystal Palace manager Sam Allardyce believes his side can build their confidence following win against Middlesbrough. Crystal Palace manager Sam Allardyce believes his side can build their confidence following win against Middlesbrough. The hosts continued to press forward, with Christian Benteke testing Victor Valdes for the first time just before the quarter-hour mark. The striker got a strong head onto a cross from Van Aaholt, but could only nestle it into the hands of the Boro goalkeeper. Middlesbrough's best chance of the half came in the 25th minute after a fine passing move. Stewart Downing threaded the ball to Gaston Ramirez on the left-hand side of the box, with his cross in turn finding the head of Alvaro Negredo at the back post. Mamadou Sakho made a winning start to life at Crystal Palace It then fell to the feet of Christian Stuani with the goal at his mercy, but a touch from Sakho just took the ball out of his path and away to safety. Palace found the breakthrough with 11 minutes of the half to play as Van Aanholt netted his fourth goal of the season. Yohan Cabaye's initial shot was blocked by Bernardo, with the rebounded ball headed away by Ayala but the Frenchman nicked it back into the path of Van Aanholt who took aim from the top of the box, sending the ball bobbling past Valdes. Middlesbrough remain just above the drop zone after the defeat Middlesbrough put in a better second-half performance, and tested Wayne Hennessey early on in what was their best spell of the game. He pushed away a free-kick from Ramirez before saving a powerful effort from Stuani. Four minutes later, Palace could have added their second as Zaha burst forward once again after the referee played an advantage. He played a fine give and go with Puncheon, but the return ball was too strong and Valdes collected. Another penalty appeal came in the 77th minute as James McArthur went to ground after what appeared to be a clip from Stewart Downing. However, Bobby Madley signalled for a Middlesbrough goal kick and showed the Palace midfielder a yellow card for simulation, much to the dismay of the home fans. James McArthur was shown a yellow card for simulation late on after a tussle with Stewart Downing But the Eagles saw out the game with relative ease as the visitors were unable to find the equaliser, leaving both level on points just above the relegation zone.

The striker moved level with Duncan Ferguson on 60 league goals for the Toffees when he scored in the 80th minute. Earlier, Idrissa Gueye scored his first Premier League goal to give the hosts the lead, firing home towards the end of a first half that Everton dominated. Sunderland threatened a response after the break and went close to equalising when Jermain Defoe saw a shot strike the bar and bounce down on the line. Romelu Lukaku celebrates scoring for Everton which equalled a club record But moments later Lukaku wrapped up the win for Everton, who are now unbeaten in nine league matches.

Ronald Koeman says Everton had a lucky moment when Romelu Lukaku scored the second goal in their win over Sunderland. Having conceded six on their last visit to Goodison Park, it was little surprise that the Black Cats opted for a defensive game plan from the start. It almost unravelled early as Jordan Pickford - back in goal for the first time since Boxing Day after recovering from injury - fumbled a shot from Ademola Lookman and had to recover quickly to stop it rolling in. Gueye celebrates scoring the opener Otherwise Sunderland largely kept Everton at bay, with Gueye going closest for the hosts with a shot from a tight angle that Pickford saved. Former Everton defender Bryan Oviedo saw an effort deflect wide at the other end after a rare Sunderland attack. But the hosts did take the lead after 40 minutes when Tom Davies picked out Coleman with a fine cross-field pass and he rolled it on to the penalty spot for the on-rushing Gueye to fire in first time. Lukaku is challenged by Sebastian Larsson The lead was nearly doubled before the break as Ross Barkley saw a shot from 25 yards saved and Davies struck the post with an effort from the edge of the box. Everton lost their grip on the game after half-time and Defoe had an effort blocked as Sunderland started to offer more in the attacking third.

Marco Silva's men had looked on course for an important victory when Tom Huddlestone calmly converted from the penalty spot (72) after Keane had handled inside the area. However, Burnley hit back just four minutes later when the former Manchester United defender took advantage of slack marking to fire home from a corner. Ashley Barnes was sent off the visitors in the dying moments but it proved to be inconsequential as Burnley held on for a rare point away from home. Michael Keane scored a late goal as Burnley drew 1-1 with Hull on Saturday Both sides have struggled to score goals throughout the season and there was a lack of quality up front in the opening quarter of the match, with Robbie Brady and Omar Elabdellaoui particularly guilty of wasting good opportunities in the final third.

Tom Huddlestone opened the scoring from the penalty spot However, it was Ben Mee who came closest to breaking the deadlock when his speculative header hit the crossbar after Eldin Jakupovic allowed the ball to slip through his hands. Poland international Kamil Grosicki then fired a superb free-kick just over Tom Heaton's bar as the home side ended the first half on the front foot. Ashley Barnes (left) fights Harry Maguire for the ball at the KCOM Stadium George Boyd was lucky to escape a red card for a dangerous challenge on Harry Maguire after the break as both sides continued to search for an opening goal. With the match stuck in a frustrating stalemate, Keane inexplicably handled the ball inside his own area - gifting the hosts a golden chance to take the lead. Joey Barton kept his place in Burnley's midfield despite his controversial performance against Lincoln City last weekend Huddlestone made no mistake to put the hosts in front with a well-placed finish to Heaton's right. Hull's lead would last only four minutes, however, as Keane - making the most of some non-existent marking - calmly slotted home from a corner to level the scores.

celebrates scoring West Brom's first goal with Chris Brunt West Brom needed some late Ben Foster heroics to deny Bournemouth and a claim a 2-1 victory at the Hawthorns. Eddie Howe's side, who are now without a win in their last six matches, took an early lead through Josh King's penalty in the fifth minute after Ryan Fraser was brought down by Allan Nyom in the penalty area. West Brom hit back five minutes late through Craig Dawson's deflected strike before Artur Boruc's howler gifted Gareth McAuley his sixth goal of the season. Both side had chances late on, but it was Tony Pulis' side that held on for a third straight league win at home thanks to two superb saves from Ben Foster to keep out two long-range efforts from substitute Lys Mousset and Tyrone Mings. Craig Dawson celebrates West Brom's equaliser It's now five games without defeat for West Brom, who stay in eighth on 40 points, while a fourth straight league defeat leaves Bournemouth in 14th just five points above the relegation zone. Bournemouth, who made two changes from the side that lost 2-0 to Manchester City with Marc Pugh and Tyrone Mings coming in for Jordan Ibe and Simon Francis, made the perfect start when Fraser burst into the box before being hauled to the ground by Nyom. Referee Mark Clattenburg, taking charge of his first game since the announcement of his pending move to Saudi Arabia, pointed to the spot and King stepped up to send Ben Foster the wrong way. Joshua King celebrates scoring his side's first goal It did not take long for West Brom to get back on level terms as Nacer Chadli's square pass picked out Dawson just outside the penalty area. The defender rifled a shot goalwards and the ball flicked up off Charlie Daniels and into the back of the net, leaving Boruc with no chance. However, Boruc was at fault as West Brom took the lead in the 22nd minute. The Poland international made a complete mess of an attempted punch and the ball fell to McAuley, who made no mistake from close range to score his sixth goal of the season. It was a nice way for the defender to mark the 500th club appearance of his career but he was needed at the other end shortly after, bravely blocking to repel a goalbound effort by Jack Wilshere. Artur Boruc (right) attempts to punch the ball but misses which leads to West Brom's second West Brom thought they should have had a penalty in the 35th minute when Mings and Salomon Rondon tangled just inside the penalty area, but Clattenburg rightly waved away the appeals Bournemouth received another reprieve at the start of the second half when Clattenburg frustrated the home fans again by disallowing Chadli's headed goal. Meanwhile, Dawson and Mings had clashed heads inside the penalty area and after receiving treatment the West Brom defender was thankfully able to walk from the pitch - but unable to continue. Craig Dawson (centre) celebrates scoring West Brom's first goal with Chris Brunt Substitute James McClean had a chance to wrap all three points up late on but his shot was blocked by the feet of Boruc. Bournemouth then pushed for an equaliser in injury time and that was when Foster came into his own. The England goalkeeper did well to help a 25-yard shot from Mousset over the crossbar before producing a full-stretch save to deny Mings right at the death.

Ghana international Ayew struck on 73 minutes to notch his first goal since Boxing Day, and only his second goal for the Hammers, who clung on for a point after Michail Antonio's dismissal for two bookable offences four minutes from time. Troy Deeney's third-minute penalty, his eighth goal of the season, had given Watford a deserved half-time lead but an assured first-half display was overshadowed by a serious injury to Mauro Zarate, who was taken to hospital for scans on his knee. The result sees Watford rise to 12th in the table while West Ham climb a place to ninth. An unchanged Hammers outfit got off to the worst possible start when stand-in right-back Cheikhou Kouyate clumsily brought Zarate to ground inside the area after two minutes. Deeney made no mistake with the spot-kick, rifling the ball low past West Ham goalkeeper Darren Randolph. With their tails up, Watford almost doubled their lead after six minutes but M'Baye Niang's thunderous drive whistled inches over the target. Troy Deeney celebrates after opening the scoring from the penalty spot Overrun in the opening period, West Ham were almost handed a route back into the game in the 11th minute but Miguel Britos' sliced clearance flashed across the face of goal. That inspired the Hammers as Sofiane Feghouli pinched possession off Jose Holebas and squared for Robert Snodgrass, whose placed finish was blocked by Younes Kaboul. Heurelho Gomes was called into action as the half drew to a close, preventing Snodgrass' driven cross from finding Feghouli before parrying Aaron Cresswell's effort away from goal. The half came to a subdued end as Zarate received 10 minutes of treatment before being carried from the field on a stretcher with a suspected knee injury. Mauro Zarate is carried from the field at Vicarage Road The injury unsettled Watford who, having controlled large swathes of the opening period, found themselves on the back foot after the break against a resurgent Hammers outfit. Having given away a penalty in the first half, Kouyate was aggrieved not to be awarded one after 50 minutes, but referee Craig Pawson adjudged him to have fouled Niang in the build-up. The Hammers continued to create chances with Manuel Lanzini's cross-come-shot forcing Gomes into a smart stop before the Watford stopper tipped Jose Forte's header wide. Andre Ayew celebrates after scoring West Ham's equaliser Antonio spurned a glorious chance to level, heading Cresswell's exquisite cross wide in the 69th minute but he atoned emphatically to provide the equaliser. After Ayew and Lanzini had combined to release the forward, Antonio raced clear of Kaboul into the Watford area, where he tried to beat Gomes at his near post. His effort cannoned off both posts before falling perfectly for Ayew who stroked the ball into the unguarded net. The joy was short-lived for Antonio, however, as he received his marching orders for deliberately handling the ball on 86 minutes. Michail Antonio is shown red by referee Craig Pawson That swung the game in Watford's favour but the hosts failed to make their man advantage count, substitute Isaac Success missing a gilt-edged chance with the last kick of the game as the spoils were shared.

Raheem Sterling broke the deadlock on 29 minutes with his fifth league goal against the Cherries, before Tyrone Mings deflected an Aguero shot past Artur Boruc to seal the win for the visitors 21 minutes from time. However, it was not all good news for Pep Guardiola's side, who saw Gabriel Jesus limp off with a foot problem in the first half, while Bournemouth also lost Jack Wilshere with an ankle problem. As a result, City move up to second in the table, eight points behind leaders Chelsea. Bournemouth remain 14th after a fifth home game without a win, six points clear of the relegation zone. Eddie Howe opted to revert to a flat back four after experimenting with three central defenders in their 6-3 loss to Everton last time out, with the Bournemouth manager making three changes from that drubbing at Goodison Park. Tyrone Mings got the final touch to divert the ball into his own net for City's second goal Full-backs Charlie Daniels and Adam Smith returned, as did Jordon Ibe for his first start in midfield since November 5, with Mings, Dan Gosling and Marc Pugh all dropping to the bench. Guardiola, meanwhile, kept up his record of never picking the same team in the top flight this season as Bacary Sagna replaced the injured Gael Clichy, meaning Aguero had to settle for a place on the bench for the third league game in a row. Raheem Sterling opened the scoring at Bournemouth However, the Argentina international did not have long to wait to enter the fray following a foot injury suffered by Jesus after 15 minutes, although that setback did not affect City. The visitors were enjoying the time and space afforded to them by Bournemouth in the first half, and could have taken the lead just before the half-hour mark after David Silva released Leroy Sane down the left. But after the German's pull back found Sterling, the forward's shot was deflected onto the post before Kevin De Bruyne's close-range follow-up was also blocked. Yaya Toure then went close to opening the scoring with a delightful curler from the edge of the box that beat Boruc, but not the left-hand post, although those near misses were soon forgotten as City took the lead. Manchester City goalkeeper Willy Caballero denied Jordon Ibe with a last-ditch challenge Once again it was Silva who was the architect as the playmaker sent Sane clear down the left, and the forward's deflected centre was tucked home by the unmarked Sterling at the far post for his sixth league goal of the season. Bournemouth thought they had got back into the contest right from the restart after Josh King stroked home Ibe's right-wing cross, however, after a slight delay the strike was ruled out for a clear pull by the striker on John Stones seconds before the ball hit the net. The Cherries' evening then went from bad to worse as influential midfielder Wilshere - who almost created an early goal for Ibe with a delightful flick, only for Willy Caballero to deny the winger with a last-ditch intervention - was forced off with an ankle injury moments before half-time. Bournemouth came out all guns blazing after the break and nearly drew level midway through the second half when substitute Benik Afobe raced clear to the left-hand byline, before picking out Harry Arter on the edge of the box. On-loan Bournemouth midfielder Jack Wilshere limped off injured against Man City However, Caballero kept his concentration to turn the midfielder's well-struck curler behind for a corner and minutes later City doubled their lead. Fernandinho fed the impressive Sterling down the left wing and after beating Smith with a delightful step over, the former Liverpool forward crossed for Aguero, whose close-range effort was deflected past Boruc at his near post by Mings. City, and in particular Sane, could have added further goals in the closing stages, but the winger saw one effort thump against the bar, before then shooting just wide of the far post after being sent clean through on goal. Next up for City are clashes against Huddersfield Town and Monaco in the FA Cup and Champions League respectively, before their next league fixture at Sunderland on March 5. Meanwhile, Bournemouth now face away trips to West Bromwich Albion and Manchester United as they look to end a poor run of six defeats in their last nine matches.

highlights of Burnley 1-1 Chelsea Robbie Brady's stunning free-kick on his full debut earned Burnley a deserved 1-1 draw against Premier League leaders Chelsea on Nissan Super Sunday. Pedro's seventh-minute strike put the visitors ahead but Brady - Burnley's club-record signing from Norwich - marked his first game at Turf Moor with an inch-perfect free-kick (24). The hosts went closest to snatching a sixth consecutive home league win, with Matthew Lowton and Andre Gray both wasting presentable opportunities. Robbie Brady scored a superb free-kick on his full Burnley debut The result means Chelsea, who face Wolves in the FA Cup fifth round next Saturday, sit 10 points clear at the top of the table, although Manchester City can cut that to eight if they beat Bournemouth on Monday Night Football. Meanwhile, 12th-place Burnley move onto 30 points, having enjoyed another creditable home performance against one of the Premier League's top teams. They have now gone six top-flight games unbeaten in front of their own supporters for the first time since September 1975. Sean Dyche made two changes from their defeat at Watford, handing full debuts to Ashley Westwood and Brady. Antonio Conte looks on from the sideline at Turf Moor Antonio Conte kept faith with the team that dismantled Arsenal at Stamford Bridge and the Blues made a flying start once again. Victor Moses burst down the right and teed up Pedro, who kept his composure to finish a brilliant Chelsea counter-attack. It was just the start the visitors wanted in front of a boisterous Turf Moor crowd and they looked set to push on before Brady struck against the run of play. The Ireland international, who was caught out of position for Chelsea's opener, made amends with his equaliser, giving Thibaut Courtois no chance with a 25-yard free-kick into the top corner. Robbie Brady celebrates his first-half goal for Burnley It sparked the hosts into life and with heavy sleet coming down, they squandered two fantastic chances to take the lead either side of half-time. Their first opening was created by the impressive Joey Barton, whose fine pass picked out the advancing Lowton only for the full-back to fire straight at Courtois. And two minutes after the break, Gray did likewise when mistakes by Gary Cahill and David Luiz put the Burnley striker one-on-one with the Chelsea goalkeeper. Luiz, who wore heavy strapping around his right knee dating back to his clash with Sergio Aguero at the Etihad, was tested time and again by Gray, whose tireless running kept Chelsea's defence on their toes. Pedro celebrates scoring Chelsea's opener against Burnley at Turf Moor With Burnley on the front foot and their front two causing problems, Conte ditched his wing-back system in the second half and went to a back four. He introduced Willian and Cesc Fabregas in an effort to re-establish control of midfield and it largely worked. The Clarets sat back in the closing stages and looked to hit their opponents on the counter, but ultimately both sides seemed happy to settle for a point. In fact, Pedro's seventh-minute goal turned out to be Chelsea's final shot on target of the match; a testament to Burnley's rugged defensive display.

to Swansea on Nissan Super Sunday. The defending Premier League champions conceded twice in the first half at the Liberty Stadium to goals from Alfie Mawson (36) and Martin Olsson (45+2), slipping to a fifth consecutive league loss. Substitute Islam Slimani wasted two good opportunities after half-time but another impressive display by Paul Clement's improving Swansea secured three vital points for the hosts. Martin Olsson scored his first goal for Swansea A fourth victory in six league games for the Swans sees them leapfrog Leicester into 15th, four points above the relegation places, while Claudio Ranieri's side drop to 17th, just one point above Hull City. The two clubs started the game precariously positioned above the drop zone but the hosts made light work of their relegation rivals, leaving Ranieri's title-winners in deep trouble. Having publicly backed their manager at the start of the week, they have now become the first champions to lose five straight games in a season since Chelsea in 1956 and are still without a league goal in 2017. Paul Clement celebrates the victory at the end of the match An FA Cup fourth-round win over Derby was supposed to provide the platform for a Premier League revival but they were second best at the Liberty. Only Demarai Gray and Marc Albrighton kept their places from that cup victory, with the likes of Riyad Mahrez and Jamie Vardy restored to the starting eleven. Despite their proximity in the table, Swansea's form had been trending in the right direction, with wins over Liverpool and Southampton followed by a commendable performance at Manchester City. Clement decided against wholesale changes, introducing Nathan Dyer for Wayne Routledge in his only alteration from the 2-1 defeat at the Etihad. But his plans hit an early setback when the former Leicester winger hobbled off after a non-contact injury, with Dyer's damaged left foot later placed in a protective boot. It meant a swift recall for Routledge, who drew a smart stop from Kasper Schmeichel with Swansea's first opening after 30 minutes. Nathan Dyer was replaced after just four minutes with a non-contact injury They took the lead six minutes later as Federico Fernandez kept alive a long free-kick, with Mawson given the freedom of the penalty area to lash home on the volley. It put the onus on Leicester to attack but not for the first time this season they struggled to get Mahrez and Vardy involved, failing to register a shot on target in the first half. It got worse just before the break as Albrighton switched off when Schmeichel's poor throw put Leicester under pressure, allowing Olsson to smash in a second at the near post. The half-time introduction of Slimani and Ben Chilwell brought an improvement from the visitors, with the Algerian striker squandering two fine chances in quick succession on the hour-mark. In a move reminiscent of last season's trademark counter-attacks, Vardy and Mahrez first combined to cut open the Swans defence only for Lukasz Fabianski to save well from Slimani's low finish. The forward barely had time to process the miss before another opportunity arrived. Again it was courtesy of Mahrez, but this time Slimani failed to make contact with a teasing cross, leaving the striker to pound the ground in frustration. Then, when Vardy was presented with a clear sight of goal in the penalty area, the England man miscued high and wide. It summed up the afternoon for Leicester, who tested Fabianski just once across the 90 minutes and have gone more than 10 hours without scoring in the league. They now face an FA Cup fifth-round tie against Millwall next Saturday before a Champions League trip to Sevilla. Swansea, meanwhile, can enjoy a two-week break before their survival bid continues away to Chelsea.

controversial opener and a late penalty as Arsenal won for the first time in three, easing the pressure on Arsene Wenger with a 2-0 victory over Hull. The Chile international unwittingly used his arm to turn Eldin Jakupovic's goal-line clearance into the back of the net on 34 minutes before he converted a penalty after Sam Clucas' handball prevented Lucas Perez's stoppage-time header. Oumar Niasse and Lazar Markovic were a constant threat for Hull before they were reduced to 10 men, but they failed to strengthen the club's survival bid as Marco Silva tasted defeat in the Premier League for only the second time. The victory momentarily moves Arsenal into third, level on points with Tottenham and nine behind Chelsea, while Hull remain 18th, a point from safety. Wenger made one change after last week's demoralising defeat at Chelsea, as Kieran Gibbs replaced Nacho Monreal at left-back to make his first league appearance since Boxing Day. Silva, meanwhile, handed Niasse and Markovic starts as Abel Hernandez and Evandro dropped out after Hull's victory over Liverpool. Alexis Sanchez celebrates scoring Arsenal's opener against Hull Freezing conditions and pre-match flurries, coupled with the fact Arsenal's titles hopes were all but extinguished at Stamford Bridge, made for a subdued start at the Emirates. It was clear the on-looking Wenger, serving the last game of his four-game touchline ban, had rallied his troops ahead of kick-off, with the hosts making a lively start to warm those in attendance. After Arsenal's bright start Hull almost stunned the Gunners with a 10th-minute counter, but after Markovic had nicked possession off Alex Iwobi, Niasse couldn't get a toe on the Serb's dangerous ball across the six-yard box. Arsene Wenger watches Arsenal's home clash with Hull City from the stands That encouraged the visitors, who went close on 14 minutes when Niasse towered above Laurent Koscielny to head Kamil Grosicki's cross on target, drawing Petr Cech into a fine save. Arsenal responded but couldn't find the target as Hector Bellerin flashed wide before Sanchez dragged a left-footed effort inches wide. However, Hull's resolve was finally broken nine minutes before the interval when Gibbs' shot was cleared off the line by Andrew Robertson, popped up and cannoned of Sanchez's arm into the goal. Alexis Sanchez celebrates his opener at the Emirates After consultation with his linesman, unsighted referee Mark Clattenburg allowed the goal to stand, much to the dismay of the Tigers. The setback failed to derail Silva's men, who started the second half in strong fashion, with Markovic and Niasse key on 51 minutes. Markovic outwitted Koscielny, burst into the Arsenal half and crossed to find Niasse in the area where the on-loan Everton striker stung Cech's palms with a rasping drive. Kieran Gibbs is shown a yellow card by referee Mark Clattenburg There was another officiating flashpoint four minutes later when last-man Gibbs saw yellow, and not red, for clearing Markovic out as he tried to latch onto Niasse's flick. Space began to open up for both teams as the game wore on but Iwobi was unable to exploit it as he curled a shot over on the hour. From there on, Arsenal's attacking threat steadily diminished, allowing Hull to mount a late rally. Markovic rose high to get on the end of Harry Maguire's 77th-minute cross only to power a header wide, and there was more profligacy from Niasse as drilled the ball into the side-netting three minutes later. Sanchez's goal was allowed to stand despite the ball clearly going in off his hand Substitute Adama Diomande then headed over before Hull's hopes evaporated when Clucas saw red for blocking Perez's goal-bound header and Sanchez crucially killed the game off from 12 yards, handing Wenger and his team-mates a timely morale-boost.

The hosts peppered Watford's goal in the first half but only had a 1-0 lead to show for it at the break, coming through Mata's sweeping finish from close range via Martial's cross. Martial doubled United's lead on the hour mark, firing into the bottom left corner from 10 yards after Zlatan Ibrahimovic's touch set him free into the area. The result means United are a point off the top four with 13 games remaining, while Watford are 12th, 10 points clear of the relegation zone. Martial was reintroduced to the starting XI at the expense of Marcus Rashford and Daley Blind came in for Marcos Rojo, while Miguel Britos came in for Valon Behrami for Watford. In the week, Martial rubbished stories suggesting he is looking to quit the club in the summer, having spent a lot of time on the United bench this season, while manager Jose Mourinho has previously urged the 21-year-old to improve his form if he wants more playing time. Juan Mata celebrates opening the scoring for United in the first half United dominated the first half, but went into the break with a paltry return for their superiority. Ibrahimovic fluffed two half-chances inside the area early on, before Martial's deflected effort went just wide of Heurelho Gomes' right-hand post. Jose Holebas went close with a fizzing long-range effort on 20 minutes, while at the other end, Gomes beat away Paul Pogba's effort from 20 yards as United stepped up the gears. Gomes superbly tipped away Pogba's first-time effort from 15 yards from an Antonio Valencia cross, while Henrikh Mkhitaryan should have done better from 20 yards as the ball fell kindly to him from Mata's ball. Gomes then saved an Ibrahimovic header from point-blank range, moments before United finally took the lead through the outstanding Mata. Zlatan Ibrahimovic tumbles under pressure from Watford's Younes Kaboul After a fine team move, Mata swept home Martial's cross from the left byline for his ninth goal of the campaign. Mauro Zarate forced a fine save out of David de Gea with a free-kick after the break, but United continued with wave after wave of sweeping attacks, and got their second on the hour mark. After Ibrahimovic's flick in-behind the defence found Martial just onside, the Frenchman edged into the area and slotted into the bottom left corner. Watford finally pushed forward in the last 20 minutes, with substitute Daryl Janmaat missing at the far post from M'Baye Niang's fine ball, while Mkhitaryan forced Gomes into a fine save down low as Ibrahimovic fed him in the box. United had to settle for the two goals, but it could have been much more for the hosts, who nevertheless thoroughly entertained the home fans.

"report": "2:53 Highlights: Middlesbrough 0-0 Everton Highlights: Middlesbrough 0-0 Everton Middlesbrough's struggles in front of goal continued as they drew 0-0 with Everton in the Premier League on Saturday. Both sides created chances in an entertaining contest at the Riverside, with Victor Valdes denying Romelu Lukaku in the first half and then saving from Ademola Lookman in the 70th minute. But Boro, the lowest scorers in the top flight and with only 11 goals at home this season, also went close as Ben Gibson saw a header cleared off the line and substitute Rudy Gestede had a powerful late effort tipped over by Joel Robles. Boro remain above the relegation zone while Everton stay seventh, although the draw does dent their top-six aspirations. It was, based on the balance of play, a fair result. While the Toffees dominated possession in the first half, they were almost caught out on several occasions either on the break or after some hesitant defending. In fact, for all Everton's passes in the opening 30 minutes, it was Boro who went closest to scoring. Twice passes were cut out in the box before the lively Adama Traore nearly got off a shot after driving through the midfield. Middlesbrough's Adama Traore puts Ademola Lookman under pressure But the visitors should have taken the lead when Bernardo Espinosa passed out of defence to Tom Davies, who sent the ball straight through to Lukaku. After scoring four last weekend, the striker was looking to equal Duncan Ferguson's club record of 60 Premier League goals, but was denied by Valdes. Everton went close again later in the half as Lookman had a shot saved from a tight angle at the back post and saw another effort blocked moments later. Lookman then fired into the side-netting from 25 yards, but a tactical change at half-time saw Boro take more control of the contest. Traore switched out to the left flank and, while continuing to threaten going forward, also prevented Seamus Coleman pushing up as much as he did in the first half. Chances were few and far between for Everton, although Lukaku almost provided a tap-in for Ross Barkley, who minutes later curled a shot over the bar. Boro almost got the breakthrough in the 65th minute when Gibson had a header from a corner cleared off the line, but were then indebted to Valdes for saving well from Lookman after a clever reverse pass from Barkley. The final chance of the match went Boro's way as Robles pulled off a sharp stop to tip over Gestede's powerful header with a couple of minutes remaining.

"2:12 Highlights as Stoke beat Crystal Palace 1-0 at the Bet365 Stadium on Saturday Highlights as Stoke beat Crystal Palace 1-0 at the Bet365 Stadium on Saturday Joe Allen scored his sixth Premier League goal of the season to give Stoke a 1-0 win over Crystal Palace on Saturday, and pile more misery on Sam Allardyce. Palace, who conceded four first-half goals in their defeat to Sunderland last weekend, held off Stoke pressure until the 67th minute when Allen calmly slotted beyond Wayne Hennessey at the Bet365 Stadium. The goal continues Allen's best-ever haul in a top-flight campaign, having scored four in the 2011-12 season with Swansea, and sees Stoke climb back into the top half of the table. Palace, meanwhile, sit just one place above bottom-placed Sunderland on goal difference and two points off safety. Crystal Palace switched to a 4-5-1 formation in the absence of Scott Dann but, with Mamadou Sakho left on the bench, the away side struggled to deal with Peter Crouch's knock-downs early on. Ramadan Sobhi, back from the Africa Cup of Nations and in for Ibrahim Afellay, took the left position of a three-man Stoke attack, with Crouch's flick to partner Marko Arnautovic bringing a smart save from Hennessey inside 10 minutes. Andros Townsend (right) was restored to the Crystal Palace starting line-up against Stoke Andros Townsend was given a rare start in a new-look Palace midfield alongside debutant Luka Milivojevic, and brought Palace's best chance of the first half when his cross found James McArthur, but the Scotland international could only head wide. Sobhi was the game's biggest threat in the first 45 minutes, picking out the unmarked Allen at the back-post after a solo run, but the Wales international headed over just after the half-hour mark. Peter Crouch offered a constant outlet for Stoke's long balls And Palace were only saved from going in at the break behind by a goal-line clearance from Townsend, who batted away Bruno Martins Indi's powerful header just before half-time. Stoke struggled to break Palace down in the second half, but just as Saido Berahino was being readied to come on, Arnautovic's lofted ball found Sobhi in the penalty area, who showed strength to hold off Palace defenders before teeing up Allen to slot the ball into the bottom corner. Palace brought on Jeffrey Schlupp, Yohan Cabaye and Loic Remy as they went in search of an equaliser late on, but Stoke absorbed the pressure and comfortably saw out the win to leapfrog West Ham and Watford into the top 10.

Gabbiadini scored two first-half goals as Southampton thrashed relegation-threatened Sunderland 4-0 at the Stadium of Light on Saturday. The January signing from Napoli netted a controversial opener with the aid of his upper arm in the 30th minute before firing a brilliant second past Vito Mannone on the stroke of half-time to put the visitors in control at the break. Jason Denayer turned home Ryan Bertrand's low cross in the 88th minute and Shane Long grabbed Saints' fourth in stoppage time (90+2) to secure their first away win since mid-December. Manolo Gabbiadini celebrates scoring one of his two goals for Southampton The victory sets Southampton up for their EFL Cup final against Man Utd on February 26, live on Sky Sports, and matches their best ever top-flight away win. But the heavy defeat leaves Sunderland rooted to the bottom of the Premier League table, two points from safety. Having beaten Crystal Palace 4-0 last weekend to bolster hopes of a survival bid, David Moyes' side were comfortably second best upon their return to the Stadium of Light. Adnan Januzaj and John O'Shea overcame knocks suffered at Selhurst Park to start for the hosts, who made just one change, bringing Darron Gibson in for the injured Jack Rodwell. Claude Puel and David Moyes Southampton, who had lost six of their last seven league matches coming into the fixture, made two alterations from their disappointing home defeat to West Ham, restoring Nathan Redmond and Dusan Tadic to the starting XI. Claude Puel's side started the game on the back foot, with Bryan Oviedo lively down Sunderland's left and Januzaj bright through the middle. But Sunderland failed to test Fraser Forster and Southampton made them pay, with the excellent Gabbiadini - who scored on debut against West Ham - poaching two goals before the interval. The first was fortunate as Bertrand's superb cross deflected off the Italian's elbow before flashing past Mannone. But his second was superb, showcasing the qualities that led Southampton to spend £17m to bring him to the Premier League from Serie A. He received a sharp pass from Tadic and turned the leaden-footed Lamine Kone inside-out before clinically firing into the far corner. Sunderland defender Lamine Kone plays a pass Tadic, playing behind the Italy international, caused Sunderland problems throughout, with the two also linking up to fashion a chance for Cedric, only for the right-back to slice wide. Moyes changed his system at half-time, introducing Steven Pienaar and Fabio Borini and moving to a back four anchored by Kone and Denayer. But it did little to halt Southampton's momentum as Mannone continued to be the busier of the two goalkeepers, making smart saves from Redmond and Tadic, while James Ward-Prowse nodded wide when well placed eight yards out. The energetic Bertrand helped Southampton wrap up the victory, bursting down the left before his low centre was turned into his own net by the unfortunate Denayer. And, with the Stadium of Light emptying, Sunderland found themselves on the wrong end of a 4-0 scoreline when substitute Long swept home from Ward-Prowse's pass. It capped a disastrous defensive performance from Sunderland, who had kept back-to-back clean sheets against Tottenham and Palace. They must pick themselves up to face Everton in two weeks' time, while Southampton have 15 days to prepare for an EFL Cup final date with Manchester United.

"2:55 Highlights: West Ham 2-2 West Brom Highlights: West Ham 2-2 West Brom West Brom netted a stoppage-time equaliser to snatch a point in a thrilling 2-2 draw against West Ham at London Stadium. Nacer Chadli gave the visitors the lead in the sixth minute, but the Hammers were aggrieved that no foul was given on Sofiane Feghouli in the build-up. However, the hosts looked to have won it after turning the match on its head in the second half through strikes from Feghouli (64) and Manuel Lanzini (86). Gareth McAuley celebrates his last-gasp equaliser The Baggies had other ideas, though, as Jonny Evans climbed highest to head a Chris Brunt corner goalwards in stoppage-time, with Gareth McAuley credited with having the final touch. Slaven Bilic, who hurled a television microphone to the ground in anger, was sent to the stands in the aftermath, joining his assistant in being banished from the touchline. The draw leaves West Brom in eighth, but the Hammers drop to tenth. The Hammers were dealt a huge blow pre-match, with Andy Carroll missing out through injury, but it was down the other end that West Ham were punished with the Baggies' first attack of the match. Sofiane Feghouli (left) moves away from Gareth McAuley The home side were incensed when the referee overlooked a collision between Feghouli and Chris Brunt, where the West Brom man seemed to leave his foot in. With play continuing, James Morrison played the ball through for Chadli, who produced a brilliant piece of skill to round Cheikhou Kouyate, before firing through the legs of Darren Randolph in the Hammers' goal. The hosts almost equalised five minutes later, but Ben Foster was at his best to superbly tip the ball around the post after Robert Snodgrass's free-kick had evaded everyone and was headed for the bottom corner. Salomon Rondon then rattled the crossbar with a volley from 20 yards, with Randolph well beaten. Nacer Chadli celebrates after scoring opener Feghouli then had the ball in the net, flicking in after Winston Reid had scuffed an effort at goal, but he was denied by a raised flag from the referee's assistant. Craig Dawson was down in the six-yard box, playing Feghouli on, hence the confusion. Michail Antonio did appear to be just offside, but Bilic's assistant Nikola Jurcevic raced down the touchline to confront the referee's assistant and earned himself a dismissal to the stands. Michail Antonio should have done better from close range, but missed his kick, as the Baggies held on to the interval. Nacer Chadli (right) celebrates his opening goal with Salomon Rondon In the second half, Bilic brough on Jonathan Calleri, switched the three at the back, giving the home side much more impetus. The pressure told as Feghouli was on hand to net the equaliser after 63 minutes. Foster had done brilliantly to tip Lanzini's brilliant effort on to the crossbar, but Feghouli reacted quickest to convert rebound. Foster then denied Calleri low to his right as the Hammers pushed for the winner, which looked to have come via the boot of Lanzini. Sofiane Feghouli equalises for West Ham Feghouli laid the ball back to Argentine, the Baggies backed off, but the strike was perfect from 25 yards, leaving Foster with no chance. Deep into stoppage time, though, there was yet more drama. Bilic was already protesting about the awarding of the corner as Brunt stepped up to take it, Evans climbed highest, headed towards goal, with McAuley getting a touch to break Hammers' hearts.

The Reds led 2-0 at the break after Mane struck twice in the space of just 138 seconds, the Senegal international's 10th and 11th goals of the season. Those quick-fire efforts were enough to hand Liverpool their first league win of 2017 and jump above both Manchester clubs into fourth in the table. Meanwhile, Tottenham remain nine points behind leaders Chelsea, albeit having played a game more than their London rivals, who host Burnley on Sunday. Sadio Mane celebrates after giving Liverpool the lead Liverpool made just one change from last weekend's 2-0 loss at Hull City, with Georginio Wijnaldum replacing Emre Can in midfield, meaning centre-back Dejan Lovren had failed to recover in time from a knee injury. Meanwhile, Spurs were unchanged from last Saturday's 1-0 win over Middlesbrough, with left-back Danny Rose and centre-back Jan Vertonghen both still missing with knee and ankle problems respectively. Despite having not won in the league all year long, though, the Reds made a fast start to proceedings at Anfield, looking confident in possession and spraying the ball around at ease. Jurgen Klopp and Mauricio Pochettino (left) shake hands before kick-off So much so that it came as no surprise when Liverpool opened the scoring after 16 minutes, with the home side winning the ball back near the centre circle, before Mane was sent clean through on goal by Wijnaldum's wonderful defence-splitting through ball. And with just Hugo Lloris to beat, Mane kept his cool before thrashing the ball high into the roof of the net. The visitors were off the pace in the first half, as shown when Eric Dier was caught napping on the ball by Mane in the lead-up to Liverpool's second goal two minutes later, before the Senegalese found Adam Lallana just inside the box. The England international then stung the palms of Lloris with a well-struck drive, but the goalkeeper could not hold on to the ball, which dropped invitingly for Roberto Firminio, waiting six yards from goal. Philippe Coutinho (right) flicks the ball on against Tottenham However, despite the forward's close-range effort being blocked, that man Mane was in the right place at the right time to double the Reds' lead, and in truth Jurgen Klopp's side could have been out of sight by the break. Mane, who was everywhere, was twice denied by good saves from the increasingly busy Lloris, while the closest Spurs came to scoring was when Ben Davies slipped Heung-Min Son through on goal midway through the half, only for Simon Mignolet to stand tall and make a key block. Unusually for a team going for the title and looking to put pressure on the leaders Chelsea, Spurs were off colour in the first period, second to every challenge and seemingly out of ideas. Liverpool foorward Sadio Mane (right) scores his second goal against Spurs However, it was much the same after the interval, despite manager Mauricio Pochettino ringing the changes in search of a formula, and goal, to get the visitors back into the contest. The closet they came, though, was when the unusually quiet Harry Kane kit the post from a Christian Eriksen free kick, but the striker was in an offside position in any case. As a result, Spurs' 11-game unbeaten run, and most likely their faint title hopes, are now over.

to move third in the Premier League table. The Brazilian teenager, preferred to Sergio Aguero for the second game in a row, tapped in the winner two minutes into added time, having opened the scoring with a close-range volley after 10 minutes. Gylfi Sigurdsson's 81st-minute strike looked to have rescued a point for Swansea, but the 19-year-old Brazilian stole back the headlines as his sensational start to life in the Premier League continues. The result sees Manchester City leapfrog Arsenal and Liverpool in the table, one point behind Tottenham, but still 10 points shy of leaders Chelsea. Swansea remain in 17th, one point and one place above the relegation zone. After being left out of the 4-0 win over West Ham on Wednesday, Claudio Bravo and Aguero were again condemned to substitute roles by Pep Guardiola, meaning goalkeeper Willy Caballero and forward Jesus both started for the second game in a row. And it looked a smart decision within 10 minutes as the young Brazilian opened the scoring after a dominant start from the home team. Captain David Silva was the architect, battling past two players on the by-line and crossing low for Raheem Sterling to bundle the ball into the path of the teenager to score his second goal in as many games. Gabriel Jesus started ahead of Sergio Aguero for the second game running Lukasz Fabianski produced a fine save as he tipped over a goal-bound Yaya Toure free-kick on 22 minutes and the City midfielder then miscued horribly wide in attempting to volley home a Silva corner. Swansea - unchanged after the midweek win over Southampton - somehow survived until half-time only one goal behind and Sigurdsson almost curled them level shortly after the break, but his brilliant free-kick was touched onto the post by the sprawling Caballero. Sergio Aguero had to watch on from the bench The woodwork was rattled at the other end by Leroy Sane's low cross and Alfie Mawson headed a Sigurdsson corner wide as Swansea, who introduced new signing Luciano Narsingh for the final 25 minutes, grew into the game. And Narsingh was the provider as Swansea equalised with nine minutes remaining, playing a sideways pass to Sigurdsson, who took a touch before striking low across Caballero from the edge of the penalty area. City may complain that substitute Nathan Dyer was in an offside position and blocking the goalkeeper as Sigurdsson scored, but the goal was just reward for an improved second-half display from the away team. Aguero replaced Sterling for the closing minutes, but it was Jesus who would be the hero with the winning goal in injury time. Silva sent in a left-footed cross from the right and Jesus timed his run brilliantly to head at Fabianski, who palmed the ball back into his path and he gleefully tapped in from a yard at the second attempt to seal the points and cement his status as the Premier League's most exciting new player. City and their new hero are next in action against Bournemouth on Monday Night Football, while Swansea will seek to bounce back in a relegation clash with Leicester live on Sky Sports next Sunday.

fears after a 3-0 defeat to Manchester United at the King Power Stadium. After a cagey start, United boss Jose Mourinho switched the formation, bringing Henrikh Mkhitaryan into a No 10 role, and it paid dividends as the Armenia international opened the scoring in the 42nd minute, before Zlatan Ibrahimovic netted his 20th goal of the season one minute and 28 seconds later. Juan Mata scored a slick third four minutes after the break to make sure of the comfortable victory for United, who remain in sixth despite extending their unbeaten league run to 15 games. Juan Mata's goal made sure of the three points Leicester's position is looking more perilous by the week, as they now sit just one point above the relegation zone. To make matters worse, the Foxes have now become the first side in Premier League history not to score in the first five league games of a calendar year. United made three changes to the side that were held by Hull in midweek, with Mourinho deploying a flat 4-2-2 - something of a relic in the modern era. The opening exchanges were scrappy as both teams struggled to find any rhythm, with Marcos Rojo's speculative effort from distance, which was easily saved, the only real attempt at goal. Zlatan Ibrahimovic celebrates his strike The bitty nature of the game led to a few niggly challenges flying in, with Eric Bailly and Jamie Vardy trading petulant kicks that went unpunished. A huge chance came and went in the 23rd minute, as Mkhitaryan clipped a cross into the path of an onrushing Marcus Rashford, but the United youngster couldn't control his half-volley on target, firing over. Rashford was proving to be a real handful for Leicester. Kasper Schmeichel had to be at his athletic best to deny the 19-year-old at the foot of his post, after Ibrahimovic and Paul Pogba had combined to tee the United youngster up. Claudio Ranieri issues instructions to Jamie Vardy at the King Power The pressure told three minutes before the interval, though, as Mkhitaryan showed his class to break the deadlock. The ball looped up into the air, Chris Smalling flicked it on, Mkhitaryan beat Huth to the ball and raced clear before firing into the top corner. Then, in the blink of an eye it was 2-0. Antonio Valencia was afforded far too much space to work space for the cross, drilled across the penalty area, Ibrahimovic held back, before converting a first-time shot into the net. Henrikh Mkhitaryan (right) and Wilfred Ndidi battle for the ball Just as the Foxes were settling into the second half, United produced an incisive move to make their position more comfortable. Mata played the ball into the feet of Mkhitaryan, who waited for Mata to make the run, returned the pass, with Wes Morgan playing the Spain international onside, before sweeping the ball home. Riyad Mahrez did come close to getting his side back in it moments later, but his free-kick only found the side netting. Down the other end, Mata really should have added a fourth when clean through, but got his finish all wrong as Schmeichel rushed out to deny him. Marcos Rojo (right) and Ahmed Musa tussle at the King Power The rest of the match was a mere procession for United, but Leicester's worries increased tenfold, especially with a trip to Swansea next up, live on Sky Sports.

The Blues led 1-0 at half-time thanks to Marcos Alonso's header, however, it was Hazard's 53rd-minute strike that brought the house down in west London. The Belgian glided past three Arsenal players during a run that started inside his own half before beating Petr Cech, who then gifted Cesc Fabregas a third after a poor clearance. The visitors managed a late consolation through Olivier Giroud's header, with Chelsea now nine points clear of their title rivals. Marcos Alonso (left) rises above Hector Bellerin to head Chelsea into a 1-0 lead Antonio Conte, who had a full-strength squad to pick from, made just the one change from the Chelsea team that drew 1-1 at Liverpool in midweek, with Pedro replacing Willian in midfield. Meanwhile, opposite number Arsene Wenger brought in Hector Bellerin, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Theo Walcott to the team that surprisingly lost at home to Watford on Tuesday night. However, Bellerin only lasted 17 minutes before being substituted with a facial injury picked up trying to prevent Alonso putting Chelsea in front. Eden Hazard (right) scores Chelsea's second goal The goal came after Victor Moses released Pedro down the right, with the Spaniard swinging in an inviting cross that Diego Costa thumped against the bar, before Alonso beat Bellerin to the rebound to head home his fourth league goal of the season. The Arsenal right back was replaced by Gabriel, although the Brazilian endured a torrid start to his game as Chelsea looked to exploit the new man. And they very nearly did just past the half-hour mark after Alonso found Pedro just inside the box, only for Cech to deny the forward. Marcos Alonso celebrates after giving Chelsea the lead Gradually, though, the visitors began to gain a foothold in proceedings and really should have drawn level seven minutes before half-time after working a corner short between Mesut Ozil and Oxlade-Chamberlain. The latter's chipped ball into the box picked out the unmarked Gabriel six yards out, but his header was beaten clear by Thibaut Courtois. That chance appeared to give the Gunners a much-needed lift after a tough first quarter of the contest, and they finished the half strongly as Ozil tested Courtois at his near post with a low shot. However, whatever Wenger may have said to his players at the interval was soon forgotten as Hazard doubled the home side's lead with one of the goals of the season. Chelsea's Eden Hazard (centre) celebrates with team-mates after scoring his team's second goal The diminutive playmaker picked up possession inside his own half and then embarked on a solo run that took him past Laurent Koscielny, Francis Coquelin - who was left on the floor - and then the Arsenal captain again, before driving the ball past Cech from close range. Wenger - watching the game from the stands as a result of the four-match ban imposed on the Frenchman for pushing a fourth official against Burnley - reacted to that strike by introducing the attacking threats of Giroud and Danny Welbeck. Olivier Giroud (right) scores Arsenal's goal at Stamford Bridge It was the England forward who came close to pulling a goal back with 12 minutes left, only for Courtois to stretch to claw his header behind for a corner, from which Shkodran Mustafi headed inches past the near post. But to complete Arsenal's misery, their former captain Fabregas added a third with five minutes remaining after ex-Blues 'keeper Cech made a hash of clearing his lines following a throw in, with the Spaniard lobbing the 'keeper from 25 yards. The visitors managed an injury-time consolation as Giroud headed home Nacho Monreal's left-wing cross, despite Courtois getting a firm hand to it, but their five-year wait for a league win at Chelsea goes on.

"2:55 Crystal Palace 0-4 Sunderland Crystal Palace 0-4 Sunderland Four goals in the first half from Sunderland helped them to dismiss Premier League relegation rivals Crystal Palace 4-0 on Saturday afternoon. David Moyes' men took the lead in the tenth minute through Lamine Kone before three goals in the final five minutes of the half sealed a vital win. Didier Ndong also opened his account for the Black Cats in the 43rd minute to double the lead, and was swiftly followed by a Jermain Defoe double in injury time that completed a first-half romp for the visitors. Sunderland remain bottom of the Premier League table after Hull's 2-0 victory against Liverpool but are level on points with Palace, who sit just above the Black Cats on goal difference. Sunderland had the first chance of the opening period inside eight minutes as Jack Rodwell - who ended his run of 39 top-flight starts without a victory - slid the ball into the path of Defoe, with the striker getting in front of Joel Ward to have a shot but Wayne Hennessey was there to make a good save. Lamine Kone and Jermain Defoe celebrate the opening goal A poor clearance from the Palace goalkeeper two minutes later lead to Sunderland going ahead. Seb Larsson delivered a free-kick that Kone met at the back post, but it was straight into the path of Hennessey. However, under pressure from Billy Jones, he could only palm it back to the feet of the defender to volley home. The Eagles did see the better of the ball during the first half, and had their best chance in the 23rd minute as a cleared corner fell to Patrick van Aanholt at the top of the box. He slid the ball to Damien Delaney on the left and he fired a cross into the box, but James Tomkins' header whistled just past the post. Kone volleys home the opening goal for Sunderland The Crystal Palace collapse was on the way as Sunderland added their second in the 43rd minute. It was club-record signing Ndong who was on target with his first goal for the club after some poor control from Joe Ledley allowed the Gabon international to slip in front and take a few strides towards goal before curling a fantastic effort past a leaping Hennessey. The three minutes of injury time saw Defoe twice get on the scoresheet. The first was a fine break from the visitors as Adnan Januzaj was set away down the left flank, before playing a cool pass into the feet of the striker who swept home. Kone put in a fine shift for Sunderland during the 4-0 victory Two minutes later, Defoe was at it again to make it 4-0 before half-time, receiving the ball on the left of the box - again from Januzaj - before turning past Tomkins and producing a powerful finish as the two sides headed down the tunnel to a chorus of boos and chants from the home fans. The second half was a much quieter affair with few chances, mostly punctured with substitutions for both sides after players continued to go down with injuries. Wilfried Zaha is tackled by Sebastian Larsson Palace had the first chance of the half in the 65th minute as Christian Benteke forced a save from Vito Mannone before the striker fired an overhead kick way over the bar after a punched corner clearance from the goalkeeper fell into his path. With two assists to his name, Januzaj went close to adding his own name to the list in the 74th minute as Bryan Oviedo fed him the ball at the top of the box but his curling effort just went past the top corner. Defoe celebrates scoring Sunderland's third goal at Selhusrt Park Palace could twice have pulled goals back as the half wore on as Wilfried Zaha fired a header into the hands of Mannone before some fantastic defending from Jason Denayer saw Sunderland also come away with a clean sheet as he sent a powerful shot from Jason Puncheon looping over the bar. Larsson could have added a jaw-dropping fifth in the 90th minute as he fizzed a shot from 25 yards just wide, but there is no doubting Moyes would be very happy with his haul as the full-time whistle blew.

The 23-year-old scored almost straight from kick-off and was gifted another - after a lucky second for James McCarthy (23) - as Ronald Koeman's side stormed into a 3-0 half-time lead. Bournemouth hit back after the break thanks to a Josh King double to set up a tenser than expected finish and Everton were hanging on until Lukaku (83, 84) scored two in two minutes to make the points safe. There was still time for Harry Arter (90) to add a third for Bournemouth before Ross Barkley rounded off the afternoon deep into stoppage time on an eventful afternoon at Goodison Park. Everton, who are unbeaten in six league matches, are now just two points behind Manchester United, who face Leicester on Super Sunday, in sixth, while they are now just six points behind Liverpool in fourth after Jurgen Klopp's side suffered a shock defeat to Hull. For Bournemouth, the loss means they are five games without a win in the league and are just six points above the relegation places. Everton sprung out of the blocks and were ahead after just 31 seconds as Lukaku combined with McCarthy before curling a left-footed shot beyond Artur Boruc and into the far corner. Romelu Lukaku (C) celebrates with his Everton team-mates Koeman handed a first start to Ademola Lookman, and the former Charlton forward was inches from adding to his side's lead, showing quick feet on the edge of the box before dragging his shot wide. Bournemouth had no answers to Everton going forward, especially Lukaku, who played a key role in doubling his side's lead. The Belgium international burst past Marc Pugh and Tyrone Mings before pulling the ball back from the byline for McCarthy, who saw his initial shot blocked by Steve Cook, but the ball bounced back off him and into the back of the net. James McCarthy (C) doubles Everton's lead In the 29th minute it was three as Simon Francis' sloppy cross-field pass gifted Lukaku with possession 12 yards out and he punished the visitors, lifting the ball over the onrushing Boruc. Lukaku was now on the hunt for a hat-trick and moments later he nearly latched on Seamus Coleman's throughball. However, Boruc was quickly off his line to deny the striker.. Bournemouth rarely threatened but they did get one chance in stoppage time at the end of the first half but Joel Robles, who had hardly had a touch, made a smart save to keep out Cook's low drive. Eddie Howe's side, who have won just two points from five matches in 2017, finally sprung into life after the break and King scored twice from close range before Harry Arter forced Robles into a full-stretch save. Everton were hanging on before Lukaku came to the rescue, converting Coleman's cross before in the 83rd minute and then holding off the challenges of two Bournemouth defenders to add his fourth a minute later. Romelu Lukaku celebrates his opening goal for Everton Arter pulled another back for the visitors in the 90th minute, sneaking one in at the near post from close range but it was Barkley, and Everton, who had the final say. The England midfielder finished things off deep in added time to make it 17 points from Everton's last seven matches, putting United and the top six firmly in their sights.

An error from Simon Mignolet allowed Alfred N'Diaye to mark his debut with Hull's opener just before half-time (44) and Oumar Niasse - on loan from Everton - rubbed salt in Liverpool's wound with a late second (84). The result moves the Tigers onto 20 points, one behind Swansea in 17th place, and continues their revival under new manager Marco Silva, who has won all four of his home games in charge. Alfred N'Diaye opened the scoring just before half-time on his debut Liverpool, meanwhile, have won just once in their last 10 games in all competitions and could fall out of the top four if Manchester City avoid defeat to Swansea on Super Sunday. Klopp made two changes from the 1-1 draw against Chelsea, recalling Sadio Mane for his first start since January 2 following Africa Cup of Nations duty. Lucas Leiva came in for the injured Dejan Lovren in their other change, while Hull made five alterations from the starting line-up that took a point from Manchester United. Silva handed debuts to Kamil Grosicki and N'Diaye and an injury suffered by Michael Dawson in the warm-up gave Andrea Ranocchia the chance to make his first league start since moving from Inter Milan. Philippe Coutinho looks to avoid Hull midfielder Evandro Despite the disruption, Hull looked a settled side and frustrated Liverpool throughout a scrappy first half. The visitors were restricted to one opportunity of note when Eldin Jakupovic saved well from Philippe Coutinho. And Silva's side took the lead with a goal just before the break through debutant N'Diaye. He capitalised on poor goalkeeping from Mignolet, tapping home from close range after the Liverpool stopper failed to claim under pressure from Abel Hernandez. The Reds improved after the break and almost equalised when Mane rose above Andrew Robertson at the back post, but Jakupovic denied the Senegal forward with a smart stop. Klopp introduced Daniel Sturridge but his side continued to labour in attack, with Coutinho again guilty of spurning their best chance when slicing wide from seven yards. Abel Hernandez had two good second-half opportunities to score for Hull Hull retained a threat on the counter and Hernandez twice went close to grabbing their second, before his replacement Niasse sealed the game with six minutes to play. The Everton loanee latched onto Ranocchia's fine through ball as two of Silva's January signings combined, with Niasse slipping his finish under the advancing Mignolet. It capped a superb counter-attacking performance by the hosts, who will look to stretch their unbeaten league run to three games when they face Arsenal next Saturday, live on Sky Sports. Liverpool's disastrous January has bled into February and they now face a fight to hold onto a top four spot, with the visit of Tottenham up next.

behind to seal a deserved 3-1 win over Southampton on Saturday. Goals from Andy Carroll (14), Pedro Obiang (45) and Mark Noble (52) represented the perfect response from Slaven Bilic's men, who had fallen behind to debutant Manolo Gabbiadini's stunning 12th-minute opener. It would prove to be an afternoon to forget for the Italian and his new team-mates as Saints lost for the sixth time in their past seven league outings. West Ham had drawn four and lost three of their previous seven visits to St Mary's, dating back to January 2002. But their third league triumph in four sees them atone for their midweek drubbing against Manchester City and move up to ninth. Southampton drop to 13th. Gabbiadini's inclusion was one of four changes Claude Puel made following the Saints' midweek defeat at Swansea. Andy Carroll celebrates his goal for West Ham at Southampton After coming on as a substitute against City, Robert Snodgrass made his full West Ham debut, while Cheikhou Kouyate returned from Africa Cup of Nations duty. There was also a swift return to St Mary's for former Southampton defender Jose Fonte. An edgy opening was swept aside on 12 minutes when Gabbiadini evaded the Hammers' offside trap and, from a tight angle, rifled the ball in off the underside of the bar to cap his debut in style. But the lead would last just two minutes as Carroll spun in behind Jack Stephens to gather Obiang's fine through pass before stroking the ball past the advancing Fraser Forster. Manolo Gabbiadini rifles home the opener on Southampton debut Carroll's fourth goal in his last four Premier League outings exuded confidence for the visitors in an assured first-half display, which was capped by them taking the lead. Having set up Carroll for the equaliser, Obiang got in on the act on the stroke of half-time, drilling home his first West Ham goal beyond Forster via the slightest of Ryan Bertrand deflections. 1 - Pedro Obiang is the first West Ham player to both score and assist in a Premier League game this season. Influence. — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) February 4, 2017 Darren Randolph had to be alert on 48 minutes to prevent James Ward-Prowse's near-post free-kick drawing Saints level as the hosts started the second period strongly. Gabbiadini spurned a great chance to double his tally on 51 minutes, allowing Aaron Cresswell to block his effort. And it proved to be costly as West Ham extended their lead in the next passage of play. Oriol Romeu tripped Snodgrass on the edge of the Saints area, handing Noble a free-kick in the inside left channel. Aaron Cresswell is tackled by Sofiane Boufal The Hammers captain lashed the ball into a dangerous area where Saints skipper Steven Davis deflected the already goal-bound effort beyond a stricken Forster. Gabbiadini had the chance to reduce the arrears immediately but he failed to punish Kouyate's poor clearance on the hour, missing the target from 10 yards. Saints kept searching for a route back into the game but Ward-Prowse, Maya Yoshida and then, at the death, Davis failed to set up a grandstand finish as the Hammers left with the points.

A controversial red card for Burnley midfielder Jeff Hendrick in the sixth minute proved an early advantage for Watford, who scored through Deeney and January signing Niang before the break. Burnley pulled a goal back through an Ashley Barnes penalty in the 78th minute after a Sebastian Prodl handball, but the Clarets could not find an equaliser as Watford held on for the win. The result means Watford now move up to 10th in the Premier League, ahead of Burnley by one point who slip down into 12th place. The Hornets made two changes to the team which beat Arsenal 2-1 on Tuesday night, with Mauro Zarate making his Watford debut and Valon Behrami entering the team for Miguel Britos and Daryl Janmaat. Jeff Hendrick fouls Jose Holebas resulting in his sending off Meanwhile Robbie Brady and Ashley Westwood made their Premier League debuts off the bench, while Steven Defour was replaced by Scott Arfield from the start due to a hamstring injury. In just the sixth minute, Watford were handed an early advantage as Hendrick was sent off for a high tackle on Jose Holebas. Whether the challenge deserved a red card or not will certainly be a talking point, and Burnley manager Sean Dyche was far from happy with referee Michael Oliver's decision. Jeff Hendrick speaks with Sebastian Prodl after a foul on Jose Holebas results in his sending off And just a few moments after Burnley were reduced to ten men, Watford took the lead. A long ball from the back to Craig Cathcart was passed on to Niang, on his left foot he played a powerful cross towards the far post, allowing Deeney to rise above Matt Lowton to nod in past goalkeeper Tom Heaton. Deeney gave Watford the lead at Vicarage Road The goal seemed to take the sting out of any Burnley fightback in the first 45 minutes as they were camped inside their own half, with the exception of a free-kick from Joey Barton which forced Heurelho Gomes into a smart save. Niang forced Heaton into another great stop 10 minutes after Deeney's opener, and on the counter-attack, debutant Zarate saw his strike go narrowly past the post. With Burnley struggling to launch quick attacks from deep, it would be Watford who would double their advantage on the stroke of half-time. Joey Barton came close to scoring with a free-kick A wonderful delivery from Holebas on the left-hand side was curled towards the near post. Niang latched onto it and deftly flicked the ball with his head into the bottom right corner to score his first Premier League goal. The second half began in a slow and scrappy fashion and it took eight minutes before Burnley had a great opportunity to find an equaliser. A corner whipped in by Arfield was met by Michael Keane, who towered above Cathcart to win the aerial battle, the ball landed onto the head of Barnes, who then flicked his header towards goal from just two yards out only for Gomes to somehow claw the ball away. Deeney was prevented from scoring thanks to a great save from Heaton Shortly afterwards, Robbie Brady would come on to make his debut and helped Burnley to create greater attacking movement. However, Watford came close again to scoring. Sean Dyche gives his reaction to Burnley's 2-1 loss to Watford at Vicarage Road Sean Dyche gives his reaction to Burnley's 2-1 loss to Watford at Vicarage Road Cleverley, who was excellent in dictating the tempo from central midfield, played a pinpoint pass out wide to Niang, who curled the ball low into the path of Deeney in the box. Deeney stretched to meet the ball but Heaton pulled off a remarkable reverse save and parried the ball away. Just seconds after a Barnes attempt from close range was cleared off the line, Burnley won a penalty after Barton's fierce shot from outside the box was handballed by Prodl. Burnley's Ashley Barnes scored from the penalty spot Barnes stepped up and smashed his strike into the bottom left-hand corner off the post, creating a nervy end to the match. With Watford's passing play getting increasingly sloppy and Dyche making positive attacking substitutions with Sam Vokes and Westwood also coming on, Burnley continued to put long balls into the box. Walter Mazzarri gives his reaction to Watford's 2-1 win over Burnley at Vicarage Road Walter Mazzarri gives his reaction to Watford's 2-1 win over Burnley at Vicarage Road In the dying minutes of the match, a poor giveaway from Cathcart allowed the ball to run into the path of Barnes, forcing Gomes into making a strong, reflex save from close range. But Watford were able to hold on to the win as Burnley's away day woes continue.

strike from James Morrison was enough for hosts 2:25 West Brom 1-0 Stoke West Brom 1-0 Stoke An early strike from James Morrison was enough for West Brom to earn a 1-0 win over Stoke at The Hawthorns on Saido Berahino's return to the club. Morrison broke the deadlock in the sixth minute, after great work from Nacer Chadli to play him in, and the Baggies looked more than comfortable for the remainder of the first half. Stoke upped the ante after the break, with Berahino coming off the bench to a chorus of boos from the stands, but the former Baggies hitman could not find an equaliser on his old stomping ground. Allan Nyom and Marko Arnautovic collide The Potters slip to 11th after the defeat, as Tony Pulis picked up his fourth win in five against his former employer. West Brom remain eighth. With Berahino on the bench, an unchanged Stoke struggled to find any rhythm early on, and it wasn't long before they were behind. Chadli carried the ball forward at pace down the left flank, delayed just long enough for Morrison to break ahead of him, the former Tottenham winger threaded the ball into Morrison, who let it run across his body before firing into the bottom corner. Ben Foster celebrates West Brom's opener Morrison almost netted his and the Baggies' second moments later, but he didn't connect with Chris Brunt's pinpoint cross from close range. Despite enjoying plenty of possession, Stoke struggled to make any inroads at all, with Peter Crouch cutting an isolated figure up front. Salomon Rondon was giving the Potters' rearguard plenty to ponder, and almost got on the scoresheet in the 34th minute, but was denied by a fine stop from Lee Grant. Nacer Chadli (left) and Charlie Adam compete for the ball As the half drew to a close, the Potters did come close to grabbing an equaliser twice, but Ryan Shawcross' header was deflected against the outside of the post, while Joe Allen's tame header was easily saved by Ben Foster. The Potters did come out with more impetus after the interval, with Phil Bardsley going close seven minutes into the second half. Then came the moment we had all been waiting for, as Berahino came off the bench, but the 23-year-old only mustered four touches in an uninspired showing. Stoke's moment came 11 minutes from time, as Erik Pieters timed his leap perfectly to get on the end of a Bardsley centre, but he couldn't direct his header on target from point-blank range. Down the other end, substitute James McClean was denied by a fine Grant save late on, but the Baggies held on for a deserved three points.

Eriksen then forced Valdes into another fine save just after the opener, but Boro stood firm for the remainder of the second half, rarely threatening Lloris' goal. Negredo did see an acrobatic effort fly a yard wide, before Marten de Roon missed Boro's best chance of the game in stoppage time, pulling his effort wide on the volley after Negredo's neat flick on.

on Wednesday. Having beaten the Hammers 5-0 in the FA Cup on their previous trip to east London in January, Pep Guardiola's side raced into a three-goal half-time lead thanks to goals from Kevin De Bruyne, David Silva and Jesus, who was preferred in attack to Sergio Aguero. Yaya Toure added a penalty after the break to cap a dominant performance as West Ham, who handed debuts to Jose Fonte and Robert Snodgrass, struggled to cope with City's pace. City had beaten West Ham 5-0 at the London Stadium in January Willy Caballero, replacing Claudio Bravo in goal, barely had a save to make en route to victory, which keeps City in fifth place, moving them level on points with Liverpool in fourth, while the Hammers remain 11th. Guardiola made three changes from their 3-0 FA Cup fourth-round win over Crystal Palace, leaving Bravo and Aguero on the bench. It gave Jesus an opportunity to make his full league debut for City and the January signing followed up his bright display at Selhurst Park with a superb performance. His pass allowed De Bruyne to side-foot home City's opener on 17 minutes, capitalising on a dreadful mistake from Aaron Cresswell. Kevin De Bruyne, David Silva and Leroy Sane celebrate The lively Leroy Sane turned provided for the visitors' second, nutmegging Sam Byram before driving past Fonte and teeing up Silva to tap past Darren Randolph. And Guardiola's side capped a devastating first-half display with their third before the break. West Ham were architects of their own downfall for a second time, though, with Pedro Obiang guilty of conceding possession cheaply in his own half. City took full advantage as Sane's piercing through ball found Sterling, who drew out Randolph and unselfishly set up Jesus to score his first goal in English football. Slaven Bilic introduced Snodgrass shortly after the interval but the former Hull playmaker had little chance to make an impact before City scored their fourth. Yaya Toure scored City's fourth from the penalty spot after the break Fonte, who endured a difficult night on his first appearance since moving from Southampton, upended Sterling to concede a penalty, which Toure dispatched past Randolph. Aguero was introduced for the last 20 minutes but with the game already won, City eased up in the final stages. Michail Antonio had a goal correctly ruled out for offside, while referee Kevin Friend turned down a hopeful Hammers penalty appeal after the ball popped up onto Jesus' arm following a challenge from Fabian Delph on Byram. Bilic's side will look to bounce back when they travel to Southampton next in the Premier League on Saturday. City host relegation-threatened Swansea at the Etihad on Sunday.

Goalkeeper Eldin Jakupovic was the hero for Marco Silva's side, denying Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Paul Pogba in the first half before saving superbly from Juan Mata on the line in the 72nd minute. Jakupovic then kept out a late shot from Pogba, but Hull could have snatched victory as Lazar Markovic hit the post and Abel Hernandez failed to control after being played through on goal. The point lifts Hull off the foot of the table while United stay sixth, four points behind fourth-placed Liverpool. United have now drawn six league games at Old Trafford this season and this result will no doubt be doubly frustrating for Jose Mourinho after seeing all of the top four fail to win on Tuesday. Mourinho also appeared to be aggrieved that Oumar Niasse was not sent off for two late tackles, having been booked early in the match. This was the third meeting between United and Hull in 2017 after also facing off in the semi-finals of the EFL Cup, and both sides made a number of changes from their FA Cup encounters at the weekend. Manchester United's Antonio Valencia of Manchester United is challenged by Josh Tymon Marcus Rashford made his first United start in the Premier League since November while Marcos Rojo kept his place in defence. Niasse and Markovic started for Hull while another January signing, Andrea Ranocchia, was on the bench. It was United who created the first opening as Ander Herrera chipped a pass over the top for Henrikh Mkhitaryan, but Andrew Robertson cleared before the Armenian could finish. Hull went close when Harry Maguire headed wide from a free-kick before Jakupovic tipped a shot from Ibrahimovic past the post in the 14th minute. Hull goalkeeper Eldin Jakupovic of Hull City is closed down by Marcus Rashford Niasse was perhaps fortunate not be sent off when he caught Michael Carrick late, having already been booked. United were largely subdued although they did create an excellent opening before half-time. Ibrahimovic, who minutes earlier had seen a low shot saved, flicked on Carrick's pass to play in Pogba, but he could not beat Jakupovic, who saved well with one hand. Manchester United's Wayne Rooney is dejected Wayne Rooney was introduced at half-time for Carrick, but still United could not find a breakthrough. Rashford scuffed wide after brilliantly controlling a ball over the top before Ibrahimovic shot past the post. Niasse again escaped a second booking when he caught Daley Blind, but it looked as though United would break the deadlock in the 72nd minute when Chris Smalling headed across goal to Mata at the back post, only for Jakupovic to save his effort on the line. Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho looks on during the match against Hull Markovic then hit the post for Hull after being slipped in by Tom Huddlestone before Hernandez failed to control when he was beyond the last defender. The final chance fell to Pogba but again he was denied by a fine save from Jakupovic.

League goal but it wasn't enough to hand Stoke all three points as they were held to a 1-1 draw by Everton. It took Crouch, who became the oldest player to reach 100 top-flight goals at 36 years and two days, just seven minutes to reach the landmark, finishing from close range after being played in by Marko Arnautovic's cross. However, Everton were awarded a controversial equaliser just before the break as the flag went up for offside against Romelu Lukaku but referee Craig Pawson, in consultation with his assistant, awarded the goal after spotting Ryan Shawcross' touch to divert Seamus Coleman's shot into the back of the net. Mark Hughes handed new signing Saido Berahino his debut in the second-half but it was the visitors, who created the clearest chance in the 86th minute as Lee Grant kept out Tom Davies' powerful header. Stoke City's Peter Crouch celebrates scoring his side's second goal The rebound fell to substitute Ademola Lookman but his shot flashed wide as it ended all square at the bet365 Stadium. The result means Everton stay seventh in the table, nine points behind fourth-placed Liverpool, while a point moves Stoke up to ninth and ahead of Burnley on goal difference. Ronald Koeman shakes hands with Mark Hughes Much of the focus before kick-off was on Stoke's £12m signing Berahino, who was handed a place on the bench by Hughes, but Crouch, starting in his position, who grabbed the early headlines. In the seventh minute a ball over the top released Arnautovic, who crossed to give Crouch the simplest of finishes to notch his 100th Premier League goal. Peter Crouch (right) scoring the opening goal with team-mates Crouch, who became the 26th player to reach a century of top-flight goals, celebrated with his trademark robot and could have had a second in the 23rd minute after being picked out by Charlie Adam, but he could not get enough power on his header to trouble Joel Robles. Crouch was handed another opportunity three minutes later and he made a sweet connection with a volley but with Robles rooted to the spot the ball flashed past the post. Despite Stoke creating the clearer opportunities Everton, who handed Morgan Schneiderlin a first start, were starting to find their rhythm and a slick passing move released Coleman into the penalty area, but under pressure from Bruno Martins Indi, the full-back fired over the crossbar. Ross Barkley is put under pressure by Ibrahim Afellay Everton then needed Robles to keep the deficit to one with the Spanish goalkeeper blocking Arnautovic's shot before grabbing an equaliser under controversial circumstances. In the 39th minute, Coleman's goal-bound shot found the back of the net after a deflection off Shawcross. The linesman's flag initially went up with Romelu Lukaku standing in an offside position but after consulting with his assistant, referee Pawson awarded the goal after spotting Shawcross' final touch. Referee Craig Pawson (blocked) is confronted by Ryan Shawcross of Stoke City after Everton's equaliser Everton brought on James McCarthy at the break for Mason Holgate and it meant a change of system for the visitors, which disrupted Stoke. Barkley was the beneficiary of a huge amount of space as the Stoke defence retreated but the England midfielder's long-range effort was comfortably saved by Grant. Adam then almost pulled of a repeat his 2015 wonder goal against Chelsea, spotting Robles off his line, but the goalkeeper scrambled back to make a last-ditch save. Hughes threw on Berahino with 23rd minutes, while Ronald Koeman responded by bring on Lookman, who forced Grant into a save with one of his first touches of the game. Saido Berahino made his Stoke debut off the bench Grant was then needed to deny Schneiderlin as the Everton pressure began to build and the Stoke goalkeeper pulled of his best save of the night with just four minutes remaining. Coleman's cross picked out the run of Tom Davies but the midfielder's powerful header was superb kept out by Grant's superb one-handed save. The danger was not over though, as the rebound fell to Lookman, who fired across goal and wide of the far post as the game ended all square.

The Gunners, who were once again without manager Arsene Wenger in the dugout because of a touchline ban, were punished by a lacklustre start and found themselves 2-0 behind thanks to goals from Younes Kaboul and Troy Deeney. The hosts rallied after the break, pulling a goal back through Alex Iwobi and they almost snatched an equaliser at the death with substitute Lucas Perez's shot smashing off the crossbar. However, Watford held on to end a run of six league games without a win and move up to 13th, eight points clear of the relegation zone. Younes Kaboul (C) of Watford celebrates scoring the opening goal Wenger's men drop to third after the shock defeat, nine points behind leaders Chelsea, who they face in a crucial Saturday lunchtime showdown, live on Sky Sports. Watford, who handed M'Baye Niang his debut, started brightly with the on-loan AC Milan forward causing Arsenal problems down the left. As brightly as Watford started, Arsenal were slow out of the blocks and they were punished in the 10th minute when Kaboul's shot deflected off Aaron Ramsey and past the dive of Petr Cech. Younes Kaboul opened the scoring for Watford Things got even better for Walter Mazzarri's side just three minutes later as a poor throw-in allowed Etienne Capoue to burst into the Arsenal half. He drove past Shkodran Mustafi before getting a shot away which was blocked by Cech. However, the ball fell to Deeney, who made absolutely no mistake from close range. Arsenal were shell-shocked and they faced further disruption when Aaron Ramsey was forced off with a calf injury. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain came on to replace the Wales international and the Gunners thought they had a penalty when Nacho Monreal went down in the box, but referee Andre Marriner booked the Spain full-back for simulation. Arsenal then needed Cech to deny Sebastian Prodl and Daryl Janmaat in quick succession and keep them in the game. Troy Deeney of Watford and Alex Iwobi of Arsenal battle for the ball The jeers rang around the Emirates stadium after Marriner blew the half-time whistle as Arsenal fans vented their frustrations, although half-time substitute Theo Walcott offered some hope with a decent strike on goal shortly after the interval. He was involved again minutes later, producing Arsenal's first shot on target as Gomes saved with his legs before denying Iwobi from close range. Arsenal's Mesut Ozil has an attempt on goal Alexis Sanchez saw his own penalty appeal turned down but was then on hand to cross for Iwobi, who steered a finish back past Gomes to hand the hosts a lifeline. Perez rattled the crossbar with a rasping drive but it was a rare moment of danger for the visitors. M'Baye Niang (C) competes for the ball against Francis Coquelin (L) and Gabriel (R) Arsenal have had plenty of joy already late on in games this season but they could not find an equaliser as Watford, who sold striker Odion Ighalo to Chinese Super League side Changchun Yatai earlier in the evening for £20m, sealed a vital win for Mazzarri.

Scott Dann put the visitors ahead with a close-range finish from Damien Delaney's flick-on shortly after half-time. Christian Benteke sealed the victory in injury time when he met Andros Townsend's cross with a trademark header. Crystal Palace flew out of the traps and almost took the lead in spectacular fashion after just three minutes when Wilfried Zaha, returning to first-team duties following his short spell at the Africa Cup of Nations, struck the post. Scott Dann put Crystal Palace ahead shortly after half-time The Ivory Coast international, comfortably the best player on the pitch in the first half, was unlucky to see his superb long-range strike hit the woodwork after skimming off the wet playing surface at the Vitality Stadium. Bournemouth responded well and nearly went ahead when Josh King fired a shot narrowly wide of Wayne Hennessey's post after a sloppy pass from Palace's new signing Patrick van Aanholt. Zaha then struck a shot straight at Artur Boruc when well placed inside the area before Junior Stanislas saw his goal-bound shot deflected wide by Dann as the two sides went in at the break goalless. However, it took just a minute for Palace to break the deadlock after the restart. Yohan Cabaye swung in a near post corner which was flicked on towards Dann, who made no mistake from six yards out to power past Boruc in the Bournemouth goal. Jason Puncheon fouls Jack Wilshere at the Vitality Stadium The Cherries should have drawn themselves level immediately afterwards but Josh King could only direct his close-range header over the bar. Palace largely limited Bournemouth to long-range efforts but the home side came agonisingly close to equalising when Steve Cook fired a well hit shot narrowly wide of the post in the closing stages. James McArthur of Crystal Palace is tackled by Simon Francis during Crystal Palace's win at the Vitality Stadium Bournemouth continued to push for an equaliser but were made the pay when substitute Townsend found Benteke unmarked in the area with an inch-perfect cross. The Belgium international made no mistake to power a header past Boruc and seal victory for the visitors with just seconds remaining. Player Ratings Bournemouth: Boruc (5), A.

The Wales international appeared to handle the ball before striking beyond Kasper Schmeichel in the 87th minute, but the incident went unnoticed by referee Mike Dean. Victory appeared to be slipping out of Burnley's reach despite their domination, with the hosts denied a penalty in the first half when Danny Drinkwater nudged Michael Keane. The win is Burnley's seventh consecutive at home in all competitions, while Leicester drop to 16th having failed to score a league goal so far in 2017. Burnley have now won 28 of their 29 points at home this season The rain poured relentlessly at Turf Moor as the game got underway, and the conditions made for a sluggish start with passes continuously skidding away from their intended receiver. Burnley's attacking duo of Ashley Barnes and Andre Gray were looking lively for the hosts, with the former flashing a half-chance wide after 11 minutes. It was Gray who then went close to breaking the deadlock, but he could only shoot into the side-netting after bursting onto a loose ball. Ashley Barnes proved a handful for Leicester all evening After a couple of long-range efforts from Leicester were comfortably saved by Tom Heaton, the first-half's talking point came when Dean waved away Burnley's claims for a penalty. It came following Jeff Hendrick's cross which Keane seemed destined to meet with his head - but a push in the back from Drinkwater went unpunished. Burnley announced the signing of Robbie Brady at half-time Boos from the Burnley fans at half-time - directed towards referee Dean - were soon followed by cheers as the signing of Robbie Brady was announced. It appeared to lift the hosts, who dominated the second half and immediately went close through Joey Barton - but the midfielder volleyed narrowly wide. Andre Gray continued to test Schmeichel but it was Leicester who went close next, though Vardy went to ground after Heaton spilled a Riyad Mahrez shot and the chance passed him by. Andre Gray and Christian Fuchs compete for the ball Burnley turned the screw and had a hat-trick of efforts blocked before Schmeichel got down well to deny Gray from a narrow angle. Barnes was then replaced by Vokes with 10 minutes to go, and the substitute went close to breaking the deadlock within a minute of coming on but failed to keep his effort down. However, three minutes from time, Vokes popped up to score a contentious winner - inadvertently bring down a Keane flick-on with his hand before stabbing home from close range. Schmeichel and the Leicester defence made their protests known - as did Claudio Ranieri when the full-time whistle was blown. Burnley have now earned 28 of their 29 points at home - and they place ninth in the table, while Leicester remain without a league win this season.

James Morrison fired in a low effort from the edge of the penalty box to give West Brom the lead after just six minutes, as Middlesbrough failed to deal with Chris Brunt's delivery. But against the run of play, Negredo sent Ben Foster the wrong way from the penalty spot after he was felled in the box by Gareth McAuley. Brunt came close to getting a second for the Baggies but his volley fell onto the roof of the net, before Cristhian Stuani appeared to collide with West Brom defender Allan Nyom but his penalty protests were waved away. Adama Traore was taking the game by the scruff of the neck and after another driving run, his cross was deflected towards his own goal by Nyom, forcing a superb point-blank save from Foster. The two sides met at the Hawthorns in August and played out a dull goalless draw, but there was no such chance of a repeat here, as the heavy rain provided the perfect back drop. West Brom's Tony Pulis was disappointed by the decision to award Middlesbrough a penalty in their 1-1 draw. West Brom's Tony Pulis was disappointed by the decision to award Middlesbrough a penalty in their 1-1 draw. Aitor Karanka's side had not won in the league since beating Swansea 3-0 in December and made yet another nervy start, as they gave away consecutive free-kicks. This would prove costly as Brunt swung in an excellent cross, which fell to the feet of midfielder Darren Fletcher who teed up Morrison to convert. West Brom continued to look dangerous following the breakthrough and Boro were struggling to deal with the pace of Matt Phillips on the wing. Alvaro Negredo (2nd L) of Middlesbrough celebrates scoring his penalty Moments later, the pendulum swung controversially in favour of the home side, when, after neat build up, Negredo was impeded by a sliding tackle from McAuley with the referee awarding a penalty. The former Manchester City forward picked himself up and coolly converted from 12-yards, sending Foster the wrong way for his sixth goal of the campaign, but they remain the divisions lowest scorers with just 18 goals. The response was immediate from the visitors and Brunt went close when his dipping volley grazed the roof of the net. In Traore, Middlesbrough have a real star on their hands and he once again showed his class. Dribbling past three players, the 21-year-old played the ball to Stuani and he was halted by Nyom and despite calls for another penalty, the referee ordered play to continue. With the half almost over, Foster was forced into an excellent save to stop Nyom turning into his own net and Valdes fumbled at the other end, before the whistle bought an end to an excellent opening 45 minutes. The momentum was with Middlesbrough after the break, but a stray elbow from Negredo on McAuley earned the former a yellow card. Tony Pulis was animated on the touchline and saw his side nearly go in front, when Phillips stooped low to head the ball against the woodwork before Rondon followed up by striking the opposite post. Foster was again called into action, once again making a brilliant save to push Fletcher's steered back-pass over the bar, before Negredo and Traore tried their luck from distance. Hal Robson-Kanu of West Bromwich Albion applauds at the end Phillips skied over the bar when well placed following a brilliant low cross from James McClean and Brunt stung the palms of Valdes, before the referee blew the final whistle.

David Moyes will ultimately be pleased with a point against a side who themselves moved into second following the stalemate at the Stadium of Light, but will rue his players not taking a handful of first-half chances. Fabio Borini went closest for the hosts on the 25-minute mark and while Spurs had plenty of pressure in the second period, they also failed to convert with Victor Wanyama heading wide in the 65th minute the pick of their efforts. But with Arsenal losing 2-1 to Watford, Mauricio Pochettino's men now sit second with a superior goal difference while Sunderland move up to 19th before Hull play Manchester United on Wednesday. The game could have started with a goal for Tottenham after a defensive mistake from Jason Denayer in the seventh minute, who tried to clear from a corner but hit the back of Harry Kane. The Spurs captain then latched onto the ball and fired a cross into the box, but Lamine Kone was there to block. Dele Alli vies with Jack Rodwell for the ball during the Premier League encounter But it was Sunderland who went the closest to breaking the deadlock in the opening period, with Jermain Defoe going close in the 10th minute as he latched onto a Jack Rodwell through-ball but saw his eventual effort go wide after holding off both Toby Alderweireld and Danny Rose. Defoe was involved again 12 minutes later as Rodwell was again the provider, keeping Alderweireld at bay before laying the ball off to the incoming Fabio Borini on his right but the Italian striker could not latch onto the cross and it ran wide. Fabio Borini is closed down by Danny Rose at the Stadium of Light But he did have the best chance of the half with 25 minutes on the clock as an Alderweireld header fell into his path, taking a nick off the arm of Walker before Borini struck, forcing a strong collection from Michel Vorm. Vito Mannone was also called into action at the other end two minutes later as Victor Wanyama tested his reflexes, forcing him to push a half volley around the post. But Sunderland were arguably lucky to still have a full complement of players on the field with 11 minutes of the half to play as Rodwell flew into a tackle on Mousa Dembele - who was set to go on the break - in clear sight of referee Lee Mason. He only received a yellow card despite the protests of the Tottenham players, who surrounded the official to little effect. The football cliché 'a game of two halves' was certainly applicable at the Stadium of Light with Spurs the better side after the break, and the away side could have nabbed an early opener as Eriksen fired a free-kick towards goal but Mannone got down low at the near post to collect the effort. Tottenham continued to press for the opener as Kane saw a cross blocked by Denayer before Heung-ming Son tried to sneak home at the near post, but Mannone was again there to make a low save. Heung-Min Son tangles with John O'Shea The visitors' best chance of the game came in the 65th minute as a cleared Spurs corner fell into the path of Son, who got away down the left of the box before whipping the ball across the face of goal. It found an unmarked Wanyama at the back post but slightly off balance, he could only head his effort agonisingly over the crossbar. Five minutes later and Mannone was forced into another low saw as Spurs put together a storming break, and the goalkeeper getting down to keep a fizzing Kane cross from reaching the feet of Son for a tap-in. Tottenham Hotspur's Kyle Walker (centre) battles for the ball with Sebastian Larsson and Javier Manquillo The remaining 20 minutes of the game was a very tame affair with neither side able to snatch the three points they both desperately needed.

The Swans broke the deadlock after 38 minutes when Alfie Mawson scored just his second goal for the club, only for Shane Long to equalise 12 minutes after half-time. However, Paul Clement recorded his first home win as Swansea manager thanks to Sigurdsson's impressive strike with 20 minutes to go as his side made it back-to-back league victories for the first time this season. Gylfi Sigurdsson celebrates after giving Swansea a 2-1 lead against Southampton As a result, Swansea are now two points clear of the relegation zone, while Southampton remain in a midtable position. Not surprisingly, Clement kept the same team who recorded the club's first-ever league win at Anfield last time out. Swansea City's Alfie Mawson (centre) celebrates scoring his side's first goal of the game However, Luciano Narsingh - a January arrival from PSV Eindhoven - was fit enough to take his place on the bench after recovering from a calf injury, as was the returning Ki Sung-yueng. The Saints, meanwhile, were without a whole host of first-team players, including the likes of James Ward-Prowse, Jay Rodriguez and Charlie Austin, who were also all absent from Saturday's 5-0 loss to Arsenal in the FA Cup. Jack Cork of Swansea City (right) controls the ball under pressure of Cedric Soares of Southampton Swansea headed into the encounter having lost their last three home league games, but after a nervy start, they gradually took control of proceedings, with Sigurdsson their driving force. The Iceland international tested Fraser Forster with a stinging drive from the edge of the area that the goalkeeper was forced to turn behind at full stretch. Dusan Tadic (left) of Southampton and Martin Olsson of Swansea City compete for the ball However, from Sigurdsson's resulting corner, Swansea opened the scoring as Mawson rose high at the near post to power a header past the helpless Forster, albeit with the help of a big deflection off Oriol Romeu. The Swans' joy was short lived, though, as the visitors drew level after 57 minutes after a flowing move down the left involving full-back Ryan Bertrand, whose cross to the near post was swept home by Long from six yards out. That equaliser gave Southampton's previously uncertain players new belief, as did the introduction of record-signing Sofiane Boufal, and at that stage of the contest there appeared only one winner. Swansea defender Alfie Mawson (left) celebrates scoring the opening goal against Southampton However, Swansea claimed the spoils thanks to a lightning-quick counterattack after a Saints corner had been cleared to Narsingh on the edge of the area.

On a night where Arsenal and Tottenham dropped points, Chelsea, who remain nine points clear, took a first-half lead courtesy of a wonderfully executed 30-yard free-kick from David Luiz that caught Simon Mignolet unawares. Georginio Wijnaldum headed an equaliser for Jurgen Klopp's team but they had to be thankful to Mignolet with 15 minutes remaining as he saved Costa's spot-kick after the Chelsea striker had been fouled by Joel Matip. The result snapped a run of three straight defeats for Liverpool but they still remain winless in the Premier League in 2017. Chelsea take on third-place Arsenal, live on Sky Sports, on Saturday lunchtime. Liverpool were boosted pre-match with the return of Sadio Mane to their ranks, although he was only fit enough for a place on the bench. Chelsea kept to their tried and tested formula that had won 15 of their last 16 Premier League games, making just one change as Pedro was given a rest with Willian coming in. Klopp's men tried to get in Chelsea's faces in the early stages, but the visitors were in wily mood as they sat deep and took the sting out of Liverpool's high press. Wijnaldum stung the palms of Thibaut Courtois on 12 minutes but that was Liverpool's only shot on target of the first-half. David Luiz scored from a free-kick at Anfield Chelsea looked a threat when Eden Hazard and Costa got the ball in Liverpool's final third, and it was the former being tripped by Adam Lallana in the 24th minute, which paved the way for Luiz to open the scoring. Willian lined the set-piece up but Luiz took the initiative while Mignolet was still getting himself set and fired an arrow-like effort into the net via the post. Liverpool complained to referee Mark Clattenburg but he had clearly whistled four seconds before Luiz struck the ball. It was the Brazilian's first goal since returning from Paris Saint-Germain last summer. Moments later, a free-kick from a similar position by Willian had to be palmed away by Mignolet as the ball skidded off the sodden Anfield turf. Liverpool managed to open up Chelsea for the first time after 49 minutes but Roberto Fimino miscued an effort from 12 yards into the stands when well found by Nathaniel Clyne. But the Anfield faithful were celebrating an equaliser eight minutes later. Jordan Henderson chipped a magnificent ball to the back post, where James Milner was waiting. The full-back kept his cool and headed back across goal and Wijnaldum climbed highest to bundle head home. Diego Costa of Chelsea and Joel Matip of Liverpool compete for the ball The equaliser changed the atmosphere inside the stadium but Chelsea rode the storm and hit Liverpool on the break with 15 minutes left. Cotsa, who had run Matip ragged all night, turned the defender inside the area and after a collision of knees, the Blues top scorer hit the deck. Clattenburg pointed straight to the spot. With Arsenal losing at Watford and Spurs drawing at Sunderland, this was a penalty that could take Chelsea 11 points clear at the top. Costa stepped up but - despite striking it with power - Mignolet guessed correctly and clawed the ball behind for a corner. Both teams had chances to win it in injury time as Firmino headed straight at Courtois and Pedro curled an effort inches wide from the edge of the box.

The hosts led 2-0 at the break after strikes by James Ward-Prowse, his first goal since September, and Jay Rodriguez. Dusan Tadic's late penalty ensured the Foxes, who are still waiting for their first away win in the Premier League this season, remain deep in trouble in 15th place, five points above the relegation zone. The 37 goals they have now conceded is more than they shipped throughout the whole of last season. The result moves Claude Puel's side up to 11th, although the victory was soured by captain Virgil van Dijk going off with an ankle injury early in the second half. Reaction from Jay Rodriguez and James Ward-Prowse after both scored in Southampton's 3-0 win Reaction from Jay Rodriguez and James Ward-Prowse after both scored in Southampton's 3-0 win Southampton made one change from their loss to Burnley in their last league game, with Rodriguez replacing Shane Long in attack. Meanwhile, the visitors made three alterations from their 3-0 home defeat to leaders Chelsea with Danny Simpson, Shinji Okazaki and Demarai Gray replacing Marc Albrighton, Ben Chilwell and Ahmed Musa. James Ward-Prowse celebrates after opening the scoring at St Mary's Southampton showed no signs of having one eye on their midweek EFL Cup semi-final second leg at Liverpool, with the Saints just one game away from Wembley, as they were on the front foot from the off. Puel's men had lost their last four games but Leicester No 1 Kasper Schmeichel was forced to turn a Nathan Redmond shot behind for a corner in the early exchanges. Claudio Ranieri says the formation change he made was the reason for Leicester's defeat Claudio Ranieri says the formation change he made was the reason for Leicester's defeat However, midway through the first half Southampton broke the deadlock after a flowing move down their right flank involving Redmond and full-back Cedric Soares, whose clever pull back found Ward-Prowse. And the midfielder swept home despite Schmeichel getting a hand to his effort. With six minutes remaining in the first half, Southampton doubled their lead, although Leicester will not be happy with how they defended Ward-Prowse's inswinging free kick. Southampton's players celebrate their 3-0 win over champions Leicester The normally imperious Robert Huth inadvertently headed the Englishman's delivery straight into the path of the unmarked Rodriguez, who beat Schmeichel with a low drive at his near post. Incredibly, that was the first time the Saints had scored more than one first-half goal in the league this season, and despite the hosts losing influential captain Van Dijk 10 minutes after the interval, their defence was rarely threatened. Claude Puel says Southampton needed a win against Leicester and was delighted with his side's display Claude Puel says Southampton needed a win against Leicester and was delighted with his side's display The closest the Foxes came to getting back into the game was when Huth headed a cross from the right into the path of centre-back partner Wes Morgan, who somehow side-footed over the target from three yards out. Leicester were made to pay for that miss when substitute Long raced through on goal, only to be upended by Morgan's clumsy challenge. Tadic making no mistake from the spot to record just his second top-flight goal of the campaign, and his first since September.

"2:58 Arsenal 2-1 Burnley Arsenal 2-1 Burnley Alexis Sanchez's 98th-minute Panenka penalty rescued 10-man Arsenal's title charge as the Gunners moved up to second with a dramatic 2-1 victory over Burnley. In a thrilling finale at the Emirates Stadium, the Chilean struck five minutes after Andre Gray's injury-time penalty moved the Clarets to within touching distance of only their second away point of the season. Arsene Wenger was sent to the stands for his protests to Burnley's equaliser, but, with seconds remaining, referee Jon Moss penalised Ben Mee's high boot on Laurent Koscielny - who was offside in the build-up - handing Sanchez the chance to restore their lead. Andre Gray's penalty looked to have secured a point for Burnley Arsenal went ahead on 59 minutes through Shkodran Mustafi's first goal for the club, but Granit Xhaka's 65th-minute dismissal, for a lunge on Steven Defour, opened the game up for the Clarets. But the Gunners produced another stirring comeback to seal a fourth victory in their last five league outings that sees them leapfrog north London rivals Tottenham into second, and move to within five points of leaders Chelsea. Burnley, whose wretched record on the road continued, drop a place to 13th. Alexis Sanchez celebrates Arsenal's winning goal Wenger and Sean Dyche named unchanged sides after their impressive victories over Swansea and Southampton respectively. Burnley started positively with a high press, preventing Arsenal from settling into their fluid passing game. However, the brilliance of Mesut Ozil and Sanchez almost laid on the opener for Olivier Giroud, Stephen Ward's last-gasp block preventing the Frenchman's glancing header on seven minutes. Arsene Wenger admits he should have kept his control after being sent off against Burnley, but denied claims of a push on the fourth official Arsene Wenger admits he should have kept his control after being sent off against Burnley, but denied claims of a push on the fourth official Burnley hit back on the counter in the 13th minute, with Ashley Barnes' near-post drive forcing Petr Cech into action. A minute later, Burnley captain Tom Heaton - unsighted by Giroud - produced a fine save to tip Ozil's curling effort behind. And that chance seemed to kick Arsenal into gear as Alex Iwobi's deflected effort fizzed wide and Laurent Koscielny headed straight at Heaton from the resulting corner, although Burnley still posed a threat, Barnes' rasping drive calling Cech into a sprawling save on 16 minutes. Reaction from Aaron Ramsey and man of the match Shkodran Mustafi after Arsenal's injury-time win against Burnley Reaction from Aaron Ramsey and man of the match Shkodran Mustafi after Arsenal's injury-time win against Burnley It would take the hosts until the 41st minute to register another substantial attempt, Sanchez drawing Heaton into a decent save before the Chilean flashed a great chance wide. The hosts dominated the start of the second half, Aaron Ramsey first seeing a volley blocked by Giroud before firing a scorpion kick fractionally over. Mustafi headed his first Arsenal goal against Burnley Sanchez sent a rasping drive inches over on 50 minutes before Gray's barge on Mustafi in the area went unpunished six minutes later. But Mustafi sought his own retribution, glancing an Ozil corner beyond Heaton as Burnley's resolve was finally broken. Any momentum gained from scoring was lost when Xhaka, having lunged in on Defour, was shown the second red card of his fledgling Arsenal career. Arsenal looked to have seen out a gritty victory until referee Moss pointed to the spot after Coquelin's foul on Barnes, boyhood Gunners fan Gray converting from 12 yards despite Cech getting a hand to the ball. But there was more drama to follow.

Blues go eight points clear 2:49 Watch highlights of Chelsea 2-0 Hull Watch highlights of Chelsea 2-0 Hull Man-of-the-match Diego Costa scored on his return to the Chelsea starting line-up as the Premier League leaders beat Hull 2-0 at Stamford Bridge to go eight points clear. Costa, who was reportedly involved in a training-ground bust-up last week and the subject of a mega-money offer from China, returned to the starting line-up after missing the trip to Leicester last weekend. And he netted his 15th Chelsea goal of the season in first-half stoppage time from 12 yards after Victor Moses' cross following a frustrating opening 45 minutes at Stamford Bridge. Diego Costa put in a man-of-the-match performance on his return to the team Hull were no pushovers, and were denied a penalty when Marcos Alonso kicked the heel of Abel Hernandez, but Chelsea wrapped up the win on 81 minutes through Gary Cahill's header from Cesc Fabregas' free-kick. The result means Arsenal are currently Chelsea's nearest challengers, as the Blues gained points on Liverpool, Tottenham, Man City and Man Utd this weekend with 16 games remaining. Hull are 19th, two points off safety. David Luiz looks to clear the ball upfield Title favourites Chelsea now face a decisive fortnight as they go to Liverpool on January 31, before hosting Arsenal on February 4. Costa replaced Willian in Antonio Conte's starting XI, while Hull were unchanged from the win over Bournemouth last week. Gary Cahill says it's been a good weekend for Chelsea after they beat Hull 2-0 and all their title rivals except Arsenal dropped points Gary Cahill says it's been a good weekend for Chelsea after they beat Hull 2-0 and all their title rivals except Arsenal dropped points Chelsea's star striker nearly scored within 10 seconds, volleying just wide from 20 yards, before Ryan Mason was worryingly stretchered off with a head injury following a clash with Cahill. Mason, who was given oxygen on the pitch, was later taken to hospital by ambulance for further assessment. The game was delayed for six minutes, and Hull remained solid throughout the first half, with Harry Maguire forcing a decent save out of Thibaut Courtois from long range. Costa scored in the first half to put Chelsea ahead Alonso's deflected effort from the edge of the box forced Eldin Jakupovic to tip the ball over the bar, before Chelsea struck in the seventh minute of added time. Hull complained that Hernandez had been dragged down by Cahill in the build-up to the goal, which saw Moses' drilled cross converted by Costa with a right-footed, first-time finish into the bottom corner. Antonio Conte was pleased to see Diego Costa back in the first team and among the goals Antonio Conte was pleased to see Diego Costa back in the first team and among the goals Costa celebrated by performing a \"chatter\" gesture with both hands after a week of heavy speculation surrounding his Chelsea future. After the break, Hull had a strong appeal for a penalty turned down by referee Neil Swarbrick after Alonso failed to clear and kicked the back of Hernandez's heel inside the box, while Courtois was tested again by a long-range effort from David Meyler. Marco Silva was pleased with Hull's performance but wants more from his team and says they will improve in their next games Marco Silva was pleased with Hull's performance but wants more from his team and says they will improve in their next games Courtois then saved from an acute angle after Michael Dawson's half-volley, as Hull arguably had the better of play in the second period. But Chelsea got their second against the run of play with nine minutes remaining, Cahill heading home unopposed in the area from substitute Fabregas' fine set piece delivery. Gary Cahill wrapped up the points with a late header Costa nearly bagged a second moments later after being played through on goal by Fabregas, but Jakupovic came out well to block the effort. Substitute and new Hull signing Oumar Niasse brought a fine save from Courtois late on with a snap-shot from an angle, but Chelsea held on to keep the clean sheet.

"Swansea players celebrate Gylfi Sigurdsson's winner Gylfi Sigurdsson's goal 16 minutes from time gave Paul Clement his first Premier League win as Swansea boss with a thrilling 3-2 victory at Liverpool. After a quiet first-half, the game burst into life after the break with Fernando Llorente poking home Sigurdsson's corner in the 48th minute after a scramble in the box. Llorente grabbed his second four minutes later with a superb header before Roberto Firmino pulled one back for the hosts in the 55th minute with a header of his own. The Brazilian scored his second of the afternoon with a sublime half volley to bring Jurgen Klopp's side level, but it was Sigurdsson who stole all the headlines to hand Swansea their first-ever league win at Anfield and move them out of the relegation zone. It was a first home defeat in 17 league matches for Liverpool, who stay in third, seven points behind leaders Chelsea who play Hull on Nissan Super Sunday. Klopp handed Philippe Coutinho a first Premier League start since November 26 after recovering from an ankle injury, while Nathaniel Clyne also returned as part of two changes from the side that drew 1-1 with Manchester United at Old Trafford. Leroy Fer of Swansea City (L) is put under pressure from James Milner of Liverpool (R) There were a couple of new faces for Swansea with debuts for Martin Olsson and Tom Carroll and from the opening whistle it was clear what Clement's intentions were, with Swansea getting plenty of white shirts behind the ball as Liverpool dominated possession. The first real sight of goal came for the hosts in the 10th minute as Jordan Henderson's cross picked out Emre Can, but the German's connection was poor, heading his effort over the crossbar. Liverpool were looking to make their dominance count and they created another opportunity eight minutes later after Firmino produced a superb piece of skill to outfox Alfie Mawson, before sending a cross into the box. Lallana met the ball, attempting replicate Andy Carroll's acrobatic effort, but the England international fired his scissor-kick effort over the bar. Adam Lallana attempts an overhead kick Despite Klopp's men having 75 per cent of the possession it was Swansea who went the closest to breaking the deadlock in the 20th minute with Carroll's effort hitting the post after taking a deflection off Dejan Lovren. At the other end, it took some excellent last-ditch defending to keep the scores level with Mawson throwing his body in the way of Firmino's shot as Swansea got to the break unscathed. Clement would have been delighted with his side's first-half defensive display, but things got even better for the visitors minutes after the restart. Lovren gave away a cheap corner and the set-piece found the head of Federico Fernandez, who headed down into the path of Llorente and, after a scramble in the box, he poked home through the legs of a Liverpool defender. Swansea striker Fernando Llorente (C) scored twice at Anfield It was the first league goal of the Clement era at Swansea, but the second followed just two minutes later thanks to a fantastic header from Llorente. A flick from Olsson sent Carroll away on the left flank and his cross was expertly met by the Spanish striker, who powered a header beyond Simon Mignolet. However, Liverpool reduced the deficit almost immediately and it was another great header, this time from Firmino, who rose above Olsson to head James Milner's cross home. Roberto Firmino of Liverpool celebrates scoring his side's first goal Klopp reacted by bringing on Daniel Sturridge for Coutinho but it was Swansea, who went close to adding a third with Mawson heading agonisingly wide from Sigurdsson's corner. Liverpool were back on level terms in the 69th minute when Firmino brought Georginio Wijnaldum's looping cross down in the centre of the penalty area, before firing into the bottom corner on the half-volley to score his second of the afternoon. Divock Origi replaced Can as Liverpool looked to press for a winner but it was Swansea who nudged ahead again leaving Anfield in a stunned silence. Llorente picked the ball up on the edge of the penalty area before laying the ball off to Carroll, whose pass deflected into the path of Sigurdsson. The Iceland international raced onto the ball before lifting it over the onrushing Mignolet. Liverpool were hunting for another equaliser and they came close through Lovren, who saw his powerful shot from 20 yards tipped over by Lukasz Fabianski. Lallana then saw his effort crash off the crossbar, before heading the rebound over after being picked out by Sturridge as Swansea held on for a famous victory.

Deeney rose highest from a left-wing corner to take advantage of some weak Boruc goalkeeping and flick a header home - his 101st goal for Watford. Troy Deeney of Watford (R) scores his side's second goal with a header The home crowd would have been expecting a response, but it didn't come as Watford looked the team in control. But in a game of changing fortunes, Bournemouth levelled again with seven minutes remaining. With the Cherries in possession and probing, an injured Kabasele decided to lie on the floor and signal to the bench. As it wasn't a head injury, Bournemouth were well within their right to play on and Andrew Surman picked out Afobe, who moved into the space in behind Kabasele. The striker got the run on Younes Kaboul and fired a low shot into the far corner. That wasn't the end of the drama though as Bournemouth thought they had nicked a winner in injury time but Afobe's close range effort was chalked off as Steve Cook had punched the ball into his path, which meant the spoils were shared.

0-1 Everton Crystal Palace 0-1 Everton Seamus Coleman's 87th-minute winner gave Everton a 1-0 victory at Crystal Palace, condemning Sam Allardyce to a fourth league defeat in a row. With the game appearing destined for a stalemate, the Republic of Ireland international rifled a near-post drive past Wayne Hennessey as the Toffees claimed their fourth victory in their last five Premier League outings. It was a bitter pill for Allardyce - who has earned just one point from his first five league games in charge of Palace - to swallow, with Jeffrey Schlupp down injured as Everton took the lead. It took Palace 79 minutes to register the first of two shots on target, evidence of the work that lies ahead Allardyce as he looks to secure the Eagles' top-flight status. Defeat combined with Swansea's win at Liverpool sees Palace drop into the relegation zone. Everton, who have cut the gap to Manchester United to five points, remain seventh. Ronald Koeman admitted he had no option but to name an unchanged side after the Toffees' demolition of Manchester City last weekend. Crystal Palace manager Sam Allardyce said his side were poor defensively but the officials may have got decisions wrong. Crystal Palace manager Sam Allardyce said his side were poor defensively but the officials may have got decisions wrong. To compete with an Everton side brimming with confidence, Allardyce gave Loic Remy his first Premier League start of the season and handed January signing Schlupp his full debut. Despite having just 20 minutes of top-flight football under his belt this term, Remy set the tone for the hosts, pestering the Everton defence from the first whistle. It was his strike partner who had to first chance though, Christian Benteke glancing James McArthur's cross onto the bar on seven minutes. Loic Remy was a real handful on his first Premier League start of the season Everton took a quarter of an hour to settle but burst into life when Ross Barkley skipped past three defenders and shot for the top corner, the slightest of deflections turning the ball away. A minute later Hennessey was called into action again, denying Kevin Mirallas' volley from point-blank range before Barkley's curling effort was tipped over on 20 minutes as the visitors peppered the Palace goal. When the Toffees finally got the better of Hennessey the post came to Palace's rescue, denying Romelu Lukaku's trickling shot before Barkley's rebound was ruled out for offside. Kevin Mirallas called Wayne Hennessey into a point-blank save in the first period It wasn't long before Hennessey was called upon again, thwarting Ramiro Funes Mori's thunderous drive on 37 minutes. Everton continued their dominance into the second half, Barkley flashing an effort across the face of goal after Tom Davies' sublime lofted pass. Barkley's trickery continued to trouble Palace, the England international curling wide on 56 minutes after evading two defenders on a mazy run. Gareth Barry and Seamus Coleman jostle with Jeffrey Schlupp for possession Unmarked in the area, Lukaku spurned a glorious chance to take the lead shortly before the hour, heading Coleman's cross onto to the roof of the net. And as the game wore on those misses saw Palace grow in confidence, the Toffees indebted to goalkeeper Joel Robles after he denied Scott Dann's goal-bound header - Palace's first attempt on target. As Palace piled forward in search of a winner, Schlupp overexerted himself, picking up an injury that would rule him out of the closing stages. Everton manager Ronald Koeman acknowledged his side were the stronger team playing better football as they beat Crystal Palace 1-0. Everton manager Ronald Koeman acknowledged his side were the stronger team playing better football as they beat Crystal Palace 1-0. Receiving treatment off the field, the game continued in Schlupp's absence though, and Everton made their man advantage count.

Ham Andy Carroll scored twice in a Premier League away game for the first time in his career and Jonathan Calleri scored his first West Ham goal in a 3-1 win at Middlesbrough. Carroll, who scored a stunning bicycle kick in the win over Crystal Palace last weekend, took the lead with a bullet header on nine minutes before firing the Hammers back ahead before half-time. Cristhian Stuani had equalised for Boro, capping off a fine passing move, but the home side's second-half domination was undone at the death when Calleri came off the bench to add the away side's third. Andy Carroll thumped home the opener with a header from a corner In the absence of wantaway forward Dimitri Payet, West Ham have registered back-to-back Premier League wins but boss Slaven Bilic will worry after losing Mark Noble and Carroll to injury in the second half. They should have taken the lead even earlier after a determined start presented Michail Antonio with a chance to tap home Aaron Cresswell's cross from all of six yards, but he missed the ball entirely. West Ham manager Slaven Bilic said his side deserved credit after beating Middlesbrough 3-1 and that confidence is growing within the team. West Ham manager Slaven Bilic said his side deserved credit after beating Middlesbrough 3-1 and that confidence is growing within the team. Carroll, however, made no mistake when fixated on Cresswell's corner delivery and punted the opener into the left-hand corner. West Ham had a sound case for a penalty when Noble was brought down in the box on 18 minutes and they were increasingly annoyed when Boro's resurgence yielded an equaliser on 27 minutes. Christian Stuani equalised for Boro when he slotted home at the far post What they cannot grumble about was the quality of the move, with Negredo nodding down to the impressive Adama Traore, who fed in Calum Chambers to cross for Stuani at the back post. Traore proved a nightmare to handle for West Ham's defenders, thriving on the right before switching to the left in the second half. He orchestrated two further chances that Boro could have taken before half-time, first flashing a cross across goal himself before setting up Chambers for another delivery towards Negredo in the six-yard box. But West Ham took the lead before the break when Antonio fired a wicked shot at Victor Valdes that the keeper could only parry in the path of Carroll, who slotted home despite suspicions of offside. Andy Carroll latched onto a loose save from Victor Valdes to bag his second The Hammers lost Noble on 55 minutes after a hard challenge, and they immediately suffered with Boro gaining control in midfield and pressing with wave after wave of attacks. But Aitor Karanka, who has signed two new strikers in Patrick Bamford and Rudy Gestede this month to try and arrest a baron spell in front of goal, watched as more chances went begging. Marten de Roon forced Darren Randolph into a full-stretched save with a header but it was Gestede, brought in for £8m from Aston Villa, who had the best effort late on when he smacked a volley inches wide of the far post. Bamford hustled and bustled but with so many players committed forward, the Hammers were able to break four on two deep into stoppage time and set-up Calleri, who has struggled since joining on loan from South America in the summer, to fire in via a deflection.

Mata missed a clear chance for United in the first half Stoke continued to frustrate United for the first half-hour, but Jose Mourinho's side began creating chances as the half wore on. Mata's afternoon turned from bad to worse as he missed a clear opportunity at the far post with the goal gaping following some unselfish play by Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who had got in-behind the Stoke defence. Mark Hughes says there was nothing Stoke could do to stop Wayne Rooney’s equaliser in their draw with Man Utd Mark Hughes says there was nothing Stoke could do to stop Wayne Rooney’s equaliser in their draw with Man Utd Henrikh Mkhitaryan then played in Ibrahimovic on the left of the area, but again the Swede chose to centre when shooting may have been the better option, allowing Bruno Martins Indi to block. Mata miscues an overhead kick attempt in the Stoke box Pogba stung the hands of Lee Grant in the Stoke goal with a volley from Blind's corner, and United would have been disappointed to hear Mark Clattenburg's half-time whistle. But they picked up where they left off in the second half, having the majority of possession in the Stoke half, but without creating chances until the final 15 minutes. Matt Le Tissier says Manchester United deserved at least a point against Stoke and was full of superlatives over Wayne Rooney’s superb record-breaking goal Matt Le Tissier says Manchester United deserved at least a point against Stoke and was full of superlatives over Wayne Rooney’s superb record-breaking goal They did have a penalty appeal turned down, with Mark Clattenburg waving play on as the ball bounced up onto Pieters' hand from Mata's touch. Rooney curls home a late free-kick to break Stoke hearts Rooney, who had been brought on with just over 20 minutes remaining, saw his cross fall to fellow sub Marcus Rashford, who guided an effort inches high and wide of Grant's goal. Rooney then miscued a header wide after Jesse Lingard's flick-on in the box, while Lingard then hit the bar with a fierce effort from 20 yards, before United finally got their leveller in the fourth minute of stoppage time. After Allen had tripped Rashford on the corner of the box to the left, Rooney stepped up and found the top right corner as the players in the penalty area expected a cross. As Wayne Rooney broke Bobby Charlton's Manchester United goalscoring record, we take a look back at some of his best in United's colours.

West Brom 2-0 Sunderland West Brom 2-0 Sunderland Stunning volleys from Darren Fletcher and Chris Brunt handed West Brom a comfortable 2-0 victory over Sunderland on Saturday. Fletcher's brilliant chest and volley fired West Brom in front after half an hour, before Brunt doubled their lead six minutes later with a powerful effort from 20 yards out. The result leaves Sunderland bottom of the table and three points from safety following Swansea's thrilling 3-2 win at Liverpool. West Brom solidify their position in the top half after inflicting a fourth defeat in five league games for the Black Cats. Darren Fletcher of West Bromwich Albion (CL) celebrates scoring his side's first goal David Moyes opted to bring in George Honeyman for this first league start, while Victor Anichebe returned to the bench having not featured for Sunderland since New Year's Eve. Meanwhile, Tony Pulis named new West Brom signing Jake Livermore on the bench, while Allan Nyom was cleared to start after FIFA rejected Cameroon's complaint which had kept him out of their two previous games. And it was Pulis' side who started the brighter of the two, peppering the Sunderland box with a number of crosses - particularly down the right through Nyom and Matt Phillips. Sunderland's solitary chance of the half came after nine minutes, but Jermain Defoe's shot on the turn was deflected out for a corner. Chris Brunt fired home West Brom's second of the afternoon The hosts then pushed on, and should have taken the lead after 29 minutes, but Salomon Rondon's goal-bound header inadvertently flicked off Phillips and sailed narrowly wide. Sunderland then made a meal of clearing a corner and following a short game of head tennis, Gareth McAuley picked out skipper Fletcher, who chested it down before volleying into the far corner to hand West Brom the lead. It was no more than West Brom deserved, and it got better just six minutes later with another sensational volley. Phillips' low ball in was initially pushed into the path of Nacer Chadli, but his effort cannoned off the crossbar and fell into the path of Brunt - who unleashed an unstoppable effort beyond Vito Mannone. After the break, Sunderland enjoyed more of the ball, but a number of free-kick routines failed to pay off when Sebastian Larsson was simply better placed to shoot. Jermain Defoe of Sunderland (L) is put under pressure from Craig Dawson of West Bromwich Albion (R) Livermore was introduced late on for the hosts, and it was almost the perfect start for the former Hull midfielder, but he shinned his shot wide after meeting a cross 10 yards out. Sunderland rarely looked like getting back into the game, and a severe lack of clear-cut chances may see Moyes look to bolster his attack before the transfer window closes.

City were largely dominant against an out-of-sorts Spurs and looked to be coasting to victory as Leroy Sane and Kevin de Bruyne both scored after half-time following mistakes by Hugo Lloris. But Spurs halved the deficit with their first shot on target as Dele Alli headed in from Kyle Walker's cross. The hosts were then denied a penalty when Walker shoved Raheem Sterling in the back when he was through on goal. Leroy Sane capitalised on Hugo Lloris' error to open the scoring City manager Pep Guardiola was left furious by the decision and his mood soured even further shortly afterwards as Heung-Min Son fired in to snatch a point for Spurs. The draw does little to help either side in their bid to catch Premier League leaders Chelsea, who will go nine points clear of Spurs if they beat Hull on Sky Sports on Sunday. But Spurs should be more content with the point after being outplayed for most of the match and scoring with both their shots on target. City started with new signing Gabriel Jesus on the bench along with John Stones, who was dropped after the 4-0 defeat to Everton. Kevin De Bruyne celebrates scoring Manchester City's second goal Kevin Wimmer replaced the injured Jan Vertonghen for Spurs, who were second best for almost the entirety of the first half. The visitors lacked composure on the ball and repeatedly presented City with openings after misplaced passes. Only a well-timed tackle from behind by Toby Alderweireld prevented Pablo Zabaleta shooting from 12 yards out before the defender fired narrowly wide from a corner after Lloris tipped a shot from David Silva behind. De Bruyne then shot across goal after Eric Dier was caught on the ball and Sane headed off target from around the penalty spot. Sergio Aguero takes a shot on goal during the match at the Etihad Spurs looked a different side to the one that had won their last six straight league matches and continued to be caught out defensively. Lloris twice saved from Sergio Aguero - the first a header, the second a shot at the near post - before Sterling's shot was blocked after a misplaced pass from Alderweireld. City eventually got the breakthrough shortly after half-time as Sane was played in with a ball over the top, Lloris failed to clear with a diving header and the German tapped into an empty net. Tottenham's Dele Alli scored the visitors' first goal of the game While Lloris might have been at fault for the goal, he was certainly to blame for City's second as he dropped a cross from Sterling right at the feet of De Bruyne, who finished from a few yards out. Spurs needed a quick response and they got it from their first shot on target as Alli headed home from Walker's cross. But City continued to threaten and they felt they should have been awarded a penalty when Sterling was shoved in the back by Walker when he was through on goal. Eric Dier of Tottenham is shown a yellow card by referee Andre Marriner Referee Andre Marriner waved away the appeals and City's frustration was compounded moments later as Kane flicked Christian Eriksen's pass on for Son to fire into the bottom corner. Still City dominated, with new signing Gabriel Jesus making a lively impact after his introduction after 82 minutes. The Brazilian fired across the face of goal before heading over the bar and then netting from an offside position from De Bruyne's cross. But City could not snatch a winner as Spurs held on for a point.

The Toffees youngster’s pass into the path of Mirallas was inch perfect, Mirallas picked out his fellow countryman Lukaku, who rifled past Claudio Bravo from the edge of the box. City almost responded in perfect fashion, as Sergio Aguero almost made contact with a low cross, before Sterling skimmed the top of the crossbar from the edge of the box moments later. Pep Guardiola appears dejected on the touchline with his team 2-0 down However, City were caught ball watching just after the break, and their static defending was punished as Mirallas doubled Everton’s advantage. Yaya Toure’s loose pass was picked up by Lukaku, who fed Ross Barkley, who in turn squeezed the ball through for Mirallas, allowing the Belgium international time to drill the ball past Bravo and into the bottom corner. Schneiderlin came on to make his Everton debut just after the hour mark to shore things up for the hosts, but City rarely offered a great deal of threat in attack. Mirallas doubles Everton's lead with a low drive And, as City committed more bodies forward, 18-year-old Davies capped a fine performance with a well-taken third , which Lukaku did he best to steal on the line. Aguero did force Robles into a fine stop minutes later, but City didn’t deserve anything for their lack of endeavour, and the result was made all the emphatic in stoppage time, as Lookman sent Goodison Park into raptures with a dream goal on his Everton bow, firing through Bravo's legs after poor defending from John Stones, to pile the pressure on Guardiola.

James Milner's first-half penalty - punishing a ragged Paul Pogba's handball - had put Jurgen Klopp's side on course to shrug off their stuttering start to the year and reclaim second spot. But, with six minutes remaining, Antonio Valencia kept a late attack alive and Ibrahimovic rose again to the occasion, flexing his neck muscles to nod home via the crossbar, as an absorbing 50th Premier League encounter between these heavyweights ended deservedly level. Liverpool - seven points behind leaders Chelsea - climb above Arsenal into third, while United - for whom record-hunting Wayne Rooney's wait goes on - stay sixth, a nine-game winning run that had rekindled title hopes halted but an unbeaten one stretched to 16 in all competitions. Jose Mourinho and Jurgen Klopp exchange words on the touchline at Old Trafford Klopp - who tussled with Mourinho on the touchline late on - had been forced to withdraw Joel Matip after failing to receive clearance from FIFA after his Africa Cup of Nations dispute with Cameroon, while injured Nathaniel Clyne was replaced by teenager Trent Alexander-Arnold. Captain Jordan Henderson returned to the starting XI, though, and Philippe Coutinho was back on the bench. Jose Mourinho deployed Ibrahimovic - who now has 13 goals in as many games - from the start, leaving Rooney among the substitutes, and had urged his side to keep emotions in check on an afternoon he declared the world would be watching. The visitors, in luminous shirts, set up as a diamond in midfield and settled the quicker, but a string of early corners came to nothing and the sides - who played out a stodgy goalless draw back in October - only probed and tested in the opening exchanges. Paul Pogba and Emre Can compete for the ball Anthony Martial quickened home pulses with an early dart into the box - a penalty appeal when he fell under Dejan Lovren's challenge swiftly dismissed - and then found Ibrahimovic waiting eagerly at the back post, the ball just evading the Swede's high boot. Liverpool had another let-off when Simon Mignolet's blocked clearance, chased down by Ibrahimovic, looped ominously towards goal but the first real chance came with 20 minutes on the clock when Pogba raced onto Henrikh Mkhitaryan's through-ball but dragged wide, leaving Mourinho grimacing on the touchline. Lovren had already lost Pogba at two set-pieces but the Frenchman was culpable with consequences on 26 minutes, an ill-advised leap with his arm outstretched prompting referee Michael Oliver to point to the spot. Milner stepped up, cool in the cauldron, and summoned enough power to beat David de Gea's dive. James Milner strikes his penalty in to the corner of David de Gea's goal United had sudden jitters but Mignolet was soon forced into a smart stop as an Ibrahimovic free-kick flew over the wet turf (32) - and the goalkeeper stood firm again to deny Mkhitaryan after Ragnar Klavan dithered. Mourinho, planning to do and set-pieces to sort, headed down the tunnel early and might have felt fate's pull when he replaced Michael Carrick with Rooney at half-time. Martial, teed up by Mkhitaryan, went agonisingly close as the hosts attacked with increased urgency at the start of the second half, but Klopp called for reinforcements of his own and fit-again Coutinho fired a warning when a clever reverse pass afforded Roberto Firmino a pop. James Milner celebrates after her opens the scoring for Liverpool Rooney - watched on by Sir Alex Ferguson and David Beckham - had a sniff of goal number 250 when a ball dropped loose on the edge of the box but the effort was tame and soon he was being chastised for a lusty challenge on Milner. Wayne Rooney had chances to finally eclipse Sir Bobby Charlton as Manchester United's all-time record goalscorer Georginio Wijnaldum failed with a flying header as Liverpool fleetingly threatened to wrestle back the momentum, but up the other end, Rooney, unaware offside had been called, sensed another shot at history, forcing Mignolet into action with a half-volley. Mournino's men had spurned a series of chances but Liverpool's resolve finally broke as time ticked away. Substitute Marouane Fellaini flicked a header against the far post and Valencia - marginally offside in the protracted build-up -recycled the attack, serving up a ball that Ibrahimovic directed in off the underside of the bar. Manchester United's Swedish striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic (C) celebrates his equaliser against Liverpool Both sides pushed for a late winner as temperatures rose - the fourth official coming between Klopp and Mourinho after Firmino and Herrera clashed towards the end - but there was no final twist on the pitch, the points frustratingly shared, no matter how enthralling the contest.

Spurs dominated from the start and struck twice before half-time, first through Kane (12) and then thanks to a Gareth McAuley own goal (26). Kane - who missed last weekend's FA Cup win over Aston Villa for the birth of his first child - added his second with a fine volley on 77 minutes and repeated the trick five minutes later, firing home from Dele Alli's scooped pass to cap a brilliant performance from the hosts. Reaction from Christian Eriksen and hat-trick hero Harry Kane Reaction from Christian Eriksen and hat-trick hero Harry Kane The victory sends Tottenham, who also lost Jan Vertonghen to an ankle injury, into second in the table above Liverpool, who face Manchester United at Old Trafford on Nissan Super Sunday. It is also their sixth consecutive Premier League win, matching a club record they can break with three points at Manchester City next weekend. Mauricio Pochettino, taking charge of his 200th game in English football, made nine changes from Tottenham’s FA Cup win over Aston Villa, restoring Alli and Kane to the starting line-up. Mauricio Pochettino was delighted his side followed up their win over Chelsea with another dominant victory against West Brom. Mauricio Pochettino was delighted his side followed up their win over Chelsea with another dominant victory against West Brom. The hosts controlled the opening half with West Brom uncharacteristically shaky in defence, and Tottenham swiftly took the lead. Kane, who had already squandered one early chance, made no mistake with his second, firing in off the post from Christian Eriksen’s pass. Tottenham added a deserved second when the Dane's drive from the edge of the box took a double deflection, first off Jonas Olsson and then McAuley, wrong-footing Ben Foster in the West Brom goal. Christian Eriksen forced Tottenham's second goal in the first half Alli saw a smart volley correctly ruled out for offside as Spurs threatened to run riot, and only Foster kept the score respectable in the first half, twice denying Kane from close range before tipping his low drive onto the post. Tony Pulis’ side failed to register a shot of any description before the break but went close less than 60 seconds after the restart when Matt Phillips dragged an effort just wide. The Baggies manager soon introduced James McClean and Hal Robson-Kanu and they improved, but Foster continued to be the much busier of the two goalkeepers. Tony Pulis says his side were not at their best against Tottenham Tony Pulis says his side were not at their best against Tottenham His fine double stop kept out strikes from Toby Alderweireld and Vertonghen, and he also made impressive saves from Victor Wanyama and Kane again before the Spurs striker finally grabbed his side’s third. Kyle Walker robbed McAuley on the flank and with Foster caught out of position, Kane expertly volleyed into an empty net. And the new father capped a perfect week by sealing his hat-trick with another volley minutes later. Alongside Alli, the pair have now combined to score Tottenham's last 10 Premier League goals. The only worry for Pochettino will be the injury suffered by Vertonghen, who appeared to badly tweak his ankle in the second half. An injury to the same ankle caused the Belgium international to miss his country's quarter-final defeat to Wales at Euro 2016 and he left the field after pounding the ground in frustration.

The veteran midfielder, who signed a short term deal until the end of the season earlier this month, struck with a long-range free-kick on 78 minutes that seemed to find its way in via Jeff Hendrick's backside. Saints had dominated possession throughout the game but could not find away past Sean Dyche's defence, which earned its fifth clean sheet of a promising campaign. Southampton dominated possession but struggled to create clear chances Dusan Tadic had a number of blocked shots in the first half for the visitors, while Virgil van Dijk went close at the death, but the Clarets move above the Saints in the table into 10th place. Barton was instrumental in Burnley's promotion campaign last season but opted to move to Rangers in the summer for what turned out to be an ill-fated move for the 34-year-old. Manager Dyche felt he had earned a second chance at Turf Moor after what he did for them last year and, after impressing in the FA Cup draw at Sunderland last week he may have been tempted to start him in this game. And that feeling might have been compounded during a first half that Burnley struggled to dictate, with sloppy and hopeful passes up-field allowing Southampton to launch wave after wave of attacks that proved fruitless. Barton had never scored at Turf Moor during his time with Burnley in the Championship Tadic almost got on the end of a few decent early crosses, while Ben Mee threatened at the other end from a Burnley corner, heading one wide of the far post before missing past the near with a shot from distance. Enjoying space on the left-hand side, Tadic sent a low effort wide of the far post while in acres of space before forcing Mee to clear another effort off the line as the game approached half-time. Steven Defour, one of two Burnley changes from the defeat to Manchester City, and Hendrick sent speculative efforts at Forster, while Nathan Redmond should have done better when he was found unmarked on the penalty spot but side-footed wide. Shane Long also sent a header into the side-netting at the far post before Barton replaced Dean Marney and immediately set to work trying to inspire his team to make the breakthrough. And Barton made no mistake when Ashley Barnes was fouled on the edge of the box, eyeing up the goal as he stood over the ball before firing low through a host of bodies and finding the slightest of knicks off Hendrick to bag his first goal at Turf Moor.

just their fourth league win of the season as they came from behind to comfortably beat Bournemouth 3-1 and start Marco Silva’s Premier League career in perfect fashion. Junior Stanislas opened the scoring from the spot after Harry Maguire had tripped Ryan Fraser (3), but Abel Hernandez levelled the tie up just after the half hour with a header (32). Hernandez turned the match on its head when he fired in just after the break as the Tigers took the lead (50), before a Tom Huddlestone shot was turned into his own net by Tyrone Mings to cap the victory (62). New Hull boss Silva began his Tigers’ venture with two cup ties and made three changes from the side that was beaten by Manchester United in the EFL Cup in midweek as his focus turned to England's top flight. Eddie Howe reverted to a more familiar starting line-up after a convincing 3-0 FA Cup defeat at Millwall last weekend, with Jack Wilshere making his first appearance of 2017. Hull were thrashed 6-1 at the Vitality Stadium in mid-October and were clearly out to avenge that scoreline, but they looked as though they’d still be propping up the table when Harry Maguire’s casual approach handed the Cherries the lead inside three minutes. After losing Wilshere, he set his sights on Fraser and as the Scot turned towards goal, Maguire unnecessarily stuck out a leg, leaving referee Martin Atkinson with little choice but to award a spot-kick. Stanislas stepped up and dispatched the penalty to Eldin Jakupovic’s right with aplomb. Junior Stanislas scored from the penalty spot for Bournemouth Bournemouth then missed chances through Harry Arter and later, Benik Afobe who had pressured Michael Dawson into a mistake as the last man. Howe’s Cherries always looked like they would struggle for luck with set-pieces as the Tigers put six men on the line at every corner, but it was their opponents who had a stroke of luck just after the half hour as they netted an equaliser. Abel Hernandez guided Hull to victory The move itself however, was anything but lucky. Huddlestone picked out Andrew Robertson in acres of space on the left, he arrowed in a whipped cross and Hernandez was there to head home. Hull ended the first half in dominant fashion and began the second equally as impressive, scoring just five minutes after the break when Hernandez doubled his tally after a left-footed drive from just inside the area. Howe then brought on Josh King and Callum Wilson in an attempt to play Hull at their own game; a move that, eventually, proved futile. Hull manager Marco Silva saw his side beat Bournemouth Hernandez went close to heading in a Adama Diomande cross just prior to the hour mark, but it only took two minutes before Hull were even further in front; Huddlestone made the best of a loose ball, taking the ball and picking his spot before the onrushing Mings inadvertently took the ball over the line. Both of Hull’s new signings, Oumar Niasse and Evandro were handed debuts in the closing stages, and although Bournemouth kept a hold on possession late on, when they did offer any sign of an attack on Jakupovic’s goal, the Hull defence were largely equal to it. Tom Huddlestone celebrates his side's third goal The victory moves Hull off the bottom of the table - they are now level on points with Crystal Palace and only inside the relegation zone thanks to their vastly inferior goal difference; Bournemouth slip down to 11th.

header secured a 3-1 win for Stoke over a disappointing Sunderland. Arnautovic's two goals in the space of seven first-half minutes was enough for the Potters to kill off any real chance of a Sunderland fightback before Peter Crouch scored just 13 minutes later. Jermain Defoe, with his 12th goal of the season, pulled one back as the first half was drawing to a close, but David Moyes' side could do no more real damage in the second half. The result means Sunderland move down to 19th while Stoke sit in ninth, two points behind West Brom. Sunderland began the game without 11 first-team players, and their lack of depth was evident to see as manager David Moyes decided to set his side out in a 3-4-3 formation. A hip injury meant Stoke were without Bojan but Joe Allen, Charlie Adam and Glenn Whelan returned to Mark Hughes' starting line-up. The first half began in an open fashion, with Stoke keen to exploit the flanks, and it took the Potters just 15 minutes to find their first goal of the match. Marko Arnautovic celebrates scoring the opening goal for Stoke against Sunderland A long ball from Shaqiri picked out Arnautovic on the left, whose first shot was saved by the trailing foot of Vito Mannone, before the ball rebounded straight back into the feet of the Austrian who, second time around, smashed the ball into the roof of the goal. With Sunderland pushing more men forward for an equaliser, Stoke swiftly went 2-0 up thanks to a stunning team goal. Arnautovic played a one-two with Shaqiri to weave through a packed Sunderland defence before playing another give-and-go with the lively Crouch. The Austria international was then able to curl the ball past Mannone to cap off one of the finest goals of Stoke's season. Marko Arnautovic capped off a fine team move shortly after his first goal And 10 minutes later, Crouch turned from creator to provider after getting on the receiving end of an excellent cross from Adam from the left. The 35-year-old beat a flapping Mannone to the ball and simply nodded his attempt in to further add to Sunderland’s defensive woes, and, for himself, his third goal in his last three Premier League matches. Peter Crouch scored Stoke's third goal of the match Despite hundreds of Sunderland fans pouring out of the stadium and a good chance missed by Jack Rodwell, Defoe was able to pull a goal back. He sprinted onto a long ball and, one-on-one with Lee Grant, slipped the ball past the goalkeeper in off the post. The second half began slowly with Sunderland looking to mount a second-half comeback. A good attempt from Borini in the 47th minute forced Grant into a smart reflex save, while Rodwell fluffed a great opportunity to make the scoreline 3-2 just moments later from just six-yards out. Jermain Defoe pulled a goal back for Sunderland As the half progressed, Stoke began sitting deeper and allowed Sunderland to dictate the tempo of the match. Moyes had little options to turn to on his bench, perhaps supporting his decision not to make a subsitute. And his side were unable to force Grant into any real action as Black Cats fans continued to filter out long before the final whistle.

Saturday. Swansea had a chance to move out of the bottom three for the first time since October 15 with a win but their task was made tougher when Olivier Giroud opened the scoring just before half-time - his fifth goal in five games. Jack Cork and Kyle Naughton then put through their own net after the break - both from Alex Iwobi crosses - before Alexis Sanchez also got in on the act with his 14th goal of the season. However, all didn’t look well with Sanchez when he was substituted, the Chilean cutting a frustrated figure on the bench with his overcoat pulled over his head. Arsenal have now taken 29 points from a possible 33 against teams in the bottom half this season and their next three home games are against Burnley, Watford and Hull. They move to within five points of league-leaders Chelsea, who play Leicester City on Saturday evening. Mesut Ozil returned to the Arsenal team in one of two changes made by Arsene Wenger from the 3-3 draw with Bournemouth in the Premier League.

Swansea continued to make life hard for the visitors as they pressed enthusiastically without the ball but clear chances were at a premium. Swansea manager Paul Clement felt his side deserved more from the match despite losing 4-0 to Arsenal. Swansea manager Paul Clement felt his side deserved more from the match despite losing 4-0 to Arsenal. This was a meeting between the league's leakiest defence and the top away scorers. That was clear to see for the opening goal. All Swansea’s hard graft in the early stages was wasted when Giroud thumped home from close range on 37 minutes after Ozil’s header from eight yards was sloppily dealt with by Alfie Mawson. Olivier Giroud (C) strokes home a shot to give Arsenal the lead at Swansea It was Giroud’s fifth goal in five games but Arsenal fans would’ve been worried to see their man hobble away following the goal and then replaced early on in the second half with an ankle injury. The hosts thought they had a way back into the game six minutes after the opening goal when the referee blew as Ki Sung-yueng took a tumble in the area under a challenge from Laurent Kosceinly. However, the Swansea man was booked for simulation. The second half was one-way traffic towards Lukas Fabianksi’s goal. Ramsey had already forced the Swans goalkeeper into a brilliant stop when Cork's unfortunate mishap doubled Arsenal’s lead. Iwobi tricked his way down the right flank and his cross caught the bottom of Cork’s studs and looped agonisingly over his goalkeeper and into the far corner. Aaron Ramsey, Alex Iwobi (C) and Olivier Giroud celebrate Federico Fernandez blazed over from 12 yards on 64 minutes but his defensive counterpart Naughton showed him how it should be done three minutes - unfortunately it was at the wrong end. Once again Iwobi caused panic in the Swansea defence with a tricky run down the left. His cross found Naughton unaware and he clumsily turned the ball into his own net from six yards out. The only aspect missing from this Arsenal performance was a Sanchez goal, but that came on 74 minutes as he scored his 14th of the season with a powerful finish from close range. Alexis Sanchez scores for Arsenal He celebrated wildly in front of the Arsenal fans, but his smile turned to a snarl minutes later when he was replaced by Danny Welbeck. The Gunners are said to be in contract renewal negotiations with the Chilean, whose contract expires in 18 months, but he didn’t look in co-operative mood with his team-mates or his manager on the bench as he cut a frustrated figure with his overcoat pulled over his face.

Tributes were paid to the former Watford manager, who died on Thursday, with chants of ‘One Graham Taylor’ ringing around the ground before and throughout the match. And while Watford’s homage to Taylor will live long in the memory, the action on the pitch will be quickly forgotten in what was ultimately a drab affair. Watford's Etienne Capoue shows his frustration after a missed chance against Middlesbrough Substitute Tom Cleverley, making his second Watford debut, came closest to finding a winner but he could only hit the post following his introduction after the break. The draw leaves Watford without a victory in six Premier League matches, while Middlesbrough are winless in four. Watford fans create a display with cards as they pay tribute to former manager Graham Taylor Before the match, fans left messages, shirts and flowers outside the ground in tribute to Taylor, who guided Watford from the old Fourth Division in 1978 to second in the First Division five years later. And with Taylor’s wife, Rita, and two daughters Joanne and Karen in attendance, the match was preceded by a minute’s applause to remember the ex-England manager. In a sluggish first half, Etienne Capoue had an early chance for the hosts, but failed to control a high ball with Victor Valdes rushing out to clear the danger. Abdoulaye Doucoure then went close after latching onto Stefano Okaka’s flick-on, but the Frenchman shot straight at Valdes. Alvaro Negredo (left) and Troy Deeney (centre) battle for possession Cristhian Stuani could have broken the deadlock for Boro, but his lobbed effort could only find the roof of the net. After the break, Okaka headed straight at Valdes before the visitors went on the counter, and Heurelho Gomes could only parry away a long-range effort from Fabio. The game was in desperate need of some vigour, and Cleverley’s introduction 13 minutes from time appeared to do just that. Tom Cleverley's introduction in the second half almost paid dividends for Watford A long throw was nodded down by Troy Deeney into Cleverley's path six yards out, but his strike ricocheted off the post before falling to Capoue, who showed little composure when in firing over. Cleverley almost then turned provider as he chipped a ball over for Deeney, but the Watford skipper saw his effort trickle wide with Valdes getting the faintest of touches on it. Watford simply could not find a winner, and a few jeers met the players at full-time following a result which leaves them 14th, two places above Boro.

The victory brought a welcome end to a turbulent week for the east Londoners after manager Slaven Bilic revealed that playmaker Dimitri Payet was refusing to play for the club anymore. But Carroll shrugged off the Frenchman's absence with a second-half wonder strike in what proved a comprehensive win and a key first victory in four games. After a quiet opening half, the game sprang to life after the interval when Sofiane Feghouli netted his first Premier League goal to break the deadlock in the 68th minute before a world-class effort from Carroll doubled the lead 11 minutes later. Manuel Lanzini rounded off the afternoon with a fine counter-attacking goal with four minutes of normal time to play to see the Hammers go nine points clear of the drop zone but leave Crystal Palace just outside on goal difference. Sofiane Feghouli celebrates his opening goal with his team-mates The opening 45 minutes was a very scrappy affair, with the first sight on goal coming in the 28th minute. A great run from Mark Noble on the right flank saw him fire a cross into the box for Carroll, but the striker’s volley just skimmed the crossbar and ended up in the crowd. Neither goalkeeper had much to do in terms of saves during the first half, but Darren Randolph was called into action four minutes later as a James Collins clearance fell to Yohan Cabaye at the top of the box, but his half-volley was well collected by the goalkeeper. Andy Carroll scored a sublime overhead kick on Saturday afternoon Crystal Palace’s best chance of the half came with nine minutes to play, as James Tomkins nearly punished his boyhood club. Andros Townsend fired a sublime free-kick into the box that found the foot of the defender, but he slightly skewed the tap-in and it rolled wide of the far post with the incoming Joe Ledley unable to get to it in time. The Eagles ended the half on slightly better terms and went close again in the 38th minute as Townsend was again involved, firing a delightful cross to the back post from the right flank, but Jason Puncheon could not get the proper contact and the West Ham defence saw the ball out of danger. West Ham United's Pedro Obiang is tackled by Yohan Cabaye Within minutes of the second half, both sides could have broken the deadlock. Carroll took a great turn at the top of the box before firing just wide while Cabaye whistled a chance over the crossbar at the other end two minutes later. The chances kept coming for Carroll, with Feghouli firing a fantastic cross into the box in the 52nd minute that the striker just headed over before Lanzini sent a fine free-kick to him at the back post that he could only poke agonisingly wide of the upright. Manuel Lanzini scored the third goal of the game for West Ham But the goals started flowing for the home side in the 68th minute as Feghouli netted his first league goal since his summer move. A sublime through-ball from Noble set off Michail Antonio into the box, who nicked the ball around an oncoming Wayne Hennessey who was far off his line, and squaring to the Algeria international to slot home into an open net. Eleven minutes later, Carroll produced an absolute stunning effort to double the Hammers’ lead and end his frustration in front of goal. Lanzini played the ball to Antonio on the right of the box, who put in a fantastic cross to the striker on the right of the box. West Ham manager Slaven Bilic praised Andy Carroll’s performance against Crystal Palace but said he worries for the striker during training. West Ham manager Slaven Bilic praised Andy Carroll’s performance against Crystal Palace but said he worries for the striker during training. Carroll steadied himself before hitting the ball with the sweetest of overhead kicks to send the effort smashing into the back of the net for one of the goals of the season as the London Stadium went wild. Lanzini rounded off the scoring in the 86th minute, and it was the third assist of the afternoon for Antonio. After Winston Reid clearance at the other end sent Antonio off on a break, bursting down the field before beautifully laying the ball off for Lanzini who continued the run. Mark Noble gets away from James McArthur at the London Stadium Hennessey was again off his line as the Argentine chipped the ball over him into an open net to seal a fine three points for the home side and plunge Palace deeper into a relegation battle.

top of the Premier League with a comfortable 3-0 win against Leicester at the King Power Stadium. Antonio Conte’s side, who were without top goalscorer Diego Costa, were sent on their way in the sixth minute when Marcus Alonso opened the scoring. The wing-back doubled his side’s advantage six minutes after half-time with the help of a deflection before Pedro rounded off the scoring in the 71st minute. The win leaves Chelsea with a healthy gap at the top over nearest rivals Tottenham, who beat West Brom 4-0 earlier in the day. Marcos Alonso opened the scoring for Chelsea For Leicester, defeat leaves them in 15th and five points clear of the relegation zone. Much of the build-up to this game was dominated by Costa, who was left out of Chelsea’s squad with Sky sources saying the Spaniard had fallen out with boss Antonio Conte after he was the subject of a £30m-per-year offer from a club in the Chinese Super League. However, Costa’s absence - which Chelsea claimed was due to a back injury - was brushed aside in only the sixth minute when Cesar Azpilicueta’s cross found its way to Eden Hazard in the penalty area and the Belgium international laid the ball off to Alonso, who drilled a shot past Kasper Schmeichel and into the bottom corner. Eden Hazard in action for Chelsea Leicester, who played three at the back to match up with Antonio Conte’s side, looked short of ideas going forward, especially in the absence Riyad Mahrez, Islam Slimani and Daniel Amartey, who are all on Africa Cup of Nations duty. Jamie Vardy was an isolated figure up front for the hosts but he did cause Chelsea’s only real alarm of the first half when Courtois clawed away the England international’s low cross. Diego Costa waves to fans on arrival at the stadiium However, the visitors always looked in control and they could have extended their lead just before the break after a well-worked free-kick resulted in Pedro steering an effort wide three minutes before the interval. The lead was extended six minutes after the break after Willian was fouled by Christian Fuchs. The Brazilian’s right-wing free-kick was cleared only as far as Alonso on the edge of the penalty area, and the 26-year-old’s low shot found the back of the net after deflecting off both Wes Morgan and Danny Drinkwater. Marcos Alonso scores his second goal for Chelsea Chelsea were in full control and attacking with freedom as Gary Cahill's overhead kick was blocked, before Alonso fired a powerful volley just wide when going in search of his hat-trick. Pedro sealed all three points with just 20 minutes left to underline Chelsea’s superiority. His flick released Willian and the Brazilian’s cross deflected up off Schmeichel for Pedro to head into an empty net.

The midfielder nodded home two crosses from Christian Eriksen - both at the back post - to stop the Blues winning for a top-flight record 14th consecutive game. The league leaders went close through Eden Hazard in the first half and Diego Costa in the second, but Spurs have cut Chelsea's lead at the top to five points and opened up the title race. Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino decided to match Chelsea like-for-like with wing-backs, and Kyle Walker and Danny Rose won the battle against Victor Moses and Marcos Alonso, who have been so instrumental to Antonio Conte's successful system. Dele Alli celebrates with Eric Dier after scoring his and Tottenham's second goal Hazard should have fired the Blues in front after just five minutes when he beat the offside trap and was played through one-on-one with Hugo Lloris, but he shot wide of the far post. Walker and Rose were menacing on both flanks and Pedro was lucky to escape with just a yellow card when he came in late on the Spurs left-back, stirring back up some resentment from the 'Battle of the Bridge' last season. Dier and man of the match and Alli speak to Sky Sports after Tottenham ended Chelsea's winning run Dier and man of the match and Alli speak to Sky Sports after Tottenham ended Chelsea's winning run Pedro and Costa then exchanged heated words after Costa failed to play the forward into a shooting position, as Chelsea grew frustrated at being unable to threaten the Tottenham goal. And Spurs had a deserved breakthrough on the stroke of the interval when Walker played in Eriksen to cross for Alli, who nodded beyond Thibaut Courtois for his sixth goal in four games. Alli directs his looping header into the top corner to put Spurs ahead Chelsea came firing out of the traps in the second half and could have equalised through either Costa, who forced Lloris to tip wide from long range, or Hazard, who missed a close-range header at the far post. But Alli made no mistake and doubled Spurs' lead on 54 minutes when Eriksen picked out another well-timed run into the box from the attacker, and he headed in for his third brace in as many matches. Chelsea looked forlorn and bewildered, as Pedro found space but headed an Alonso cross feebly at Lloris, so Conte threw on Willian, Cesc Fabregas and Michy Batshuayi. Alli scores his and Tottenham's second goal of the game But Tottenham held on for a memorable, fifth straight win to move third in the Premier League and just two points behind second-place Liverpool.

Arsenal Bournemouth 3-3 Arsenal Arsenal came back from 3-0 down with 20 minutes remaining to earn a 3-3 draw in a thrilling encounter at Bournemouth on Tuesday. The Gunners were seemingly down and out in the 70th minute, before Alexis Sanchez's header and substitute Lucas Perez's stunning volley brought the visitors to within touching distance of an unlikely point. Arsene Wenger says he is happy with the comeback at Bournemouth but was disappointed his Arsenal side were unable to win the game Arsene Wenger says he is happy with the comeback at Bournemouth but was disappointed his Arsenal side were unable to win the game After Bournemouth went down to 10 men following Simon Francis' high tackle on Aaron Ramsey, Olivier Giroud popped up in stoppage time to bring Arsenal level with a guided header. The first hour had been a different story, with Bournemouth socring twice in the space of five minutes to take a 2-0 lead in the first half; Charlie Daniels slotted under Petr Cech before Callum Wilson netted a penalty following Granit Xhaka's clumsy foul on Ryan Fraser. Bournemouth's Charlie Daniels scores his side's first goal of the game Fraser made it 3-0 on 58 minutes from an acute angle after more poor defending, before Arsenal's dramatic comeback. The result means Arsenal are in fourth, eight points behind leaders Chelsea, who could open up an 11-point gap on them with a win at Spurs on Wednesday, live on Sky Sports. Bournemouth are ninth. Callum Wilson converts the penalty to score his side's second goal against Arsenal Arsene Wenger re-introduced Aaron Ramsey, Francis Coquelin and Shkodran Mustafi for the clash on the south coast, while Arsenal loanee Jack Wilshere was ineligible for Bournemouth. But Eddie Howe's side didn't need him early on, coming out of the blocks with far more tempo than their opponents. Bournemouth were ahead on 16 minutes through Daniels, who was found in acres of space on the left by Junior Stanislas' fine pass, before taking a touch beyond Hector Bellerin and sticking the ball under Cech from 10 yards. Daniels celebrates Bournemouth's opener against Arsenal It was 2-0 minutes later as Xhaka needlessly pushed Fraser as the Bournemouth man was moving away from goal on the corner of the penalty area, allowing Wilson to roll the ball past Cech from the spot. Ramsey saw a half-volley on the swivel deflected just wide by Daniels after half an hour, while the injured Coquelin was replaced by Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain as Wenger's men looked anxious and frustrated with their performance. Thierry Henry believes Liverpool and Arsenal have missed the opportunity to up the pressure on Premier League leaders Chelsea Thierry Henry believes Liverpool and Arsenal have missed the opportunity to up the pressure on Premier League leaders Chelsea Alex Iwobi poked the ball just wide from 15 yards under pressure from Simon Francis, before Stanislas flashed the ball just wide in first-half stoppage time. Bournemouth continued to press in the second half and were 3-0 up through the impressive Fraser, who latched onto Daniels' ball down the channel, nudged Bellerin aside and finished under Cech from an angle. Arsenal's Lucas Perez scores his side's second goal of the game Arsenal got one back on 70 minutes through Sanchez, who headed home at the far post from Giroud's flick on after Oxlade-Chamberlain's cross. It was 3-2 five minutes later in stunning fashion, as Perez superbly volleyed home from an acute angle 12 yards out as Giroud again flicked on Xhaka's central pass. Arsenal's Alexis Sanchez scores his side's first goal Dan Gosling should have wrapped up the points for Bournemouth with seven minutes remaining, curling over the bar in acres of space in the area after Bellerin had played him onside. Bournemouth were reduced to 10 men moments later after Francis went over the ball and caught Ramsey in midfield, and the equaliser soon followed. With six minutes added on, Giroud headed home in the second of those, glancing the ball off the far post from Xhaka's deft ball into the box. Despite the comeback, both sides seemed disheartened with the result at full-time, and Giroud himself admitted to Sky Sports it felt like two points dropped.

relegation rivals Crystal Palace in the Premier League at Selhurst Park. With incoming boss Paul Clement watching on from the stands, Alfie Mawson had headed the Swans in front just before half-time on Tuesday night, before Wilfried Zaha's stunning 83rd-minute equaliser looked to have nicked a point for Palace. But Rangel turned up in the box late on to slot the winner and lift Swansea off the bottom of the table and into 19th, one point off Palace in 17th. Swansea City's Angel Rangel celebrates scoring his side's second goal Sam Allardyce, meanwhile, is still chasing a first win in charge of the club, having added a second-straight defeat to their draw with Watford in his first game in charge. Swansea had the extra day of rest heading into the game, and it showed in the first 45 minutes as they dominated virtually throughout. Fernando Llorente was the first to go close after six minutes, heading wide from close range after Wayne Routledge had dinked a lovely cross into his path. The Swans then saw great chances go amiss for Ki Sung-yueng, Federico Fernandez and Routledge, and it would have cost them were it not for Palace being controversially denied a penalty after 33 minutes. One long ball from goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey managed to beat the entire Swansea defence, and Christian Benteke raced onto it before appearing to be tripped by Lukasz Fabianski as he attempted to round him. Referee Paul Tierney, however, waved it away, much to the fury of the home fans at Selhurst Park. And to add to their anger, Swansea finally did take the lead three minutes before half-time, as Mawson did well to flick a header from Gylfi Sigurdsson's inswinging free-kick into the bottom corner. Alfie Mawson (2nd L) celebrates scoring the opening goal for Swansea Palace were forced to withdraw Benteke at half-time after the striker got injured during the penalty incident in the first half, with Fraizer Campbell replacing him up top. Sam Allardyce then threw on Bakary Sako for Andros Townsend shortly afterwards, and the changes helped to vastly improve Palace's attacking play, with Sako wanting a penalty in the 77th minute after going down under a challenge from Rangel, who also appeared to handle it, only for appeals to be denied again. Zaha switched to the right and immediately provided a real threat to Swansea, but it was a drift into the middle that finally saw Palace grab the equaliser seven minutes from time. And it was a sensational finish from the newly-converted Ivory Coast winger, playing his final game before heading to the African Cup of Nations. Martin Kelly's cross was just behind Zaha, but he managed to wheel his body around and thrash a volley home from the edge of the area. It was a goal worthy of a Premier League point in any context, but it wasn't to be for Palace as Swansea managed to nick it late on as substitute Rangel was found by Leroy Fer while running in behind, before finishing smartly past Hennessey to send the away fans into jubilation.

"FT Stoke 2 - 0 Watford FT Stoke 2 - 0 Watford Stoke ended a run of five games without a win as Ryan Shawcross and Peter Crouch netted in a 2-0 victory over Watford on Tuesday night. Crouch had been out in the wilderness under Mark Hughes but his second goal in three days put a strong case forward for his contract, which expires in July, to be renewed at the end of the season. Two crosses from Charlie Adam provided the goals as Watford's defensive frailties came to the fore again, meaning Walter Mazzarri's men have gone 10 games without a clean sheet. Stoke City's Ryan Shawcross (second left) celebrates scoring his side's opening goal The defeat also means Watford have won just one of their last eight games. Hughes had Marko Arnautovic available for selection again after the Austrian's three-match ban, while Watford made three changes to the side blown away 4-1 by Tottenham. There was no place for Nordin Amrabat, who was one of 10 first-team players missing through injury, meaning Watford had three academy graduates on the bench. Watford's Troy Deeney during the Premier League game Both teams looked nervy in the opening exchanges and chances were at a premium. Arnautovic and Jose Holebas livened things up with a couple of skillful nutmegs but it failed to spark the game into life. Crouch had a header punched clear by Heurelho Gomes on 31 minutes and Abdoulaye Doucouré should have done better for Watford minutes later when found by Holebas but he decided to pass to Troy Deeney instead of taking the shot on. Heurelho Gomes of Watford dives for the ball The first-half looked to be fizzling out but Shawcross struck with the last kick before the interval. Three minutes into added time, Adam swung a low corner into the near post and Shawcross brushed aside the attentions of Adlène Guedioura before side-footing home into the bottom corner - it was the 10th time Watford have conceded from a corner this season. Stoke goalkeeper Lee Grant is set to turn his loan move from Derby into a permanent one in this transfer window and he proved his worth on 48 minutes to palm away an effort from Doucouré. Lee Grant of Stoke City celeberates his side's first goal It proved to be a big moment in the match as 90 seconds later, Stoke were 2-0 to the good. Adam was given far too much space to whip a low cross into the near post, which was missed by Sebastian Prodl and Crouch was on hand to force the ball home with his knee. Peter Crouch of Stoke City celebrates scoring his team's second goal with Joe Allen Jonathan Walters was twice denied by Gomes in the final quarter of the match - firstly from close range after a Crouch knockdown and then from 15 yards when the goalkeeper threw a strong hand to divert the ball over the crossbar. Peter Crouch of Stoke City scores his side's second goal Despite the deficit, Watford never gave up the fight and Prodl flicked a header inches wide with 13 minutes remaining. But Stoke held on for a much-needed victory and clean sheet, having shipped four goals apiece in their previous two defeats to Liverpool and Chelsea.

Leicester Middlesbrough 0-0 Leicester Middlesbrough were held to a goalless draw by Leicester City at the Riverside Stadium on Monday afternoon. Gaston Ramirez squandered the best opportunity of the game with seven minutes to play, smashing a half-volley just wide of Kasper Schmeichel's post. Leicester, who have taken just three points from a possible 30 away from home in the Premier League this season, almost snatched victory when Andy King's header was saved deep into stoppage time. George Friend felt Middlesbrough should have been awarded a penalty for Robert Huth's challenge on Adama Traore George Friend felt Middlesbrough should have been awarded a penalty for Robert Huth's challenge on Adama Traore Boro, who had a £6m bid for Rudy Gestede accepted by Aston Villa before kick-off, are now winless against the Foxes in their last 14 league matches and remain two points behind the defending champions in 16th place. The two teams are in FA Cup third round action next as Middlesbrough host Sheffield Wednesday and Leicester travel to Everton, with Claudio Ranieri set to be without Riyad Mahrez, Islam Slimani, Daniel Amartey and Jeff Schlupp, who will report for Africa Cup of Nations duty. Leonardo Ulloa and Adam Forshaw battle for possession at the Riverside Ranieri and Aitor Karanka each made five changes following New Year's Eve fixtures and it led to a disjointed first half lacking chances. With Slimani absent due to a virus and Danny Drinkwater rested, Ranieri opted for Shinji Okazaki and Leonardo Ulloa up front but the first opportunity fell to the returning Christian Fuchs, who fired narrowly wide from 20 yards. Adama Traore was Boro's main threat and he had a penalty appeal rejected when he tumbled under the challenge of Robert Huth in the Leicester box. Marten de Roon miscued a first-time effort over Schmeichel's bar and Traore wasted a couple of promising crossing opportunities as Middlesbrough pushed for an opener. Karanka, forced to replace Antonio Barragan with George Friend before the break due to a suspected hamstring injury, also introduced Stewart Downing and the hosts enjoyed the better of the second half. Wes Morgan and Robert Huth felt it was a good point considering their away form this season Wes Morgan and Robert Huth felt it was a good point considering their away form this season Friend offered an outlet for Boro on their left and his teasing low delivery failed to get the finish it deserved, with Alvaro Negredo and Ramirez on their heels. The substitute then went close himself, firing over after cutting in off his left flank, while Ulloa headed straight at Brad Guzan, in goal for the injured Victor Valdes. Alvaro Negredo gestures in frustration during the Premier League match at the Riverside Stadium Middlesbrough continued to look the more likely and should have gone ahead when Ramirez smashed his low shot wide after Wes Morgan's miscued clearance. Ranieri brought on Ahmed Musa and Demarai Gray and the visitors nearly stunned Boro late on, but Ulloa headed over before King's awkward effort was saved by Guzan.

3-0 Southampton Everton 3-0 Southampton Enner Valencia came off the bench to inspire Everton to a 3-0 victory over Southampton at Goodison Park on Monday. The game was a poor spectacle until the on-loan West Ham player was introduced as a replacement for Aaron Lennon just after the hour mark. Valencia tapped in the opener with 17 minutes to go and then won a penalty when he drew a foul from Maya Yoshida, with Leighton Baines converting. Romelu Lukaku got the third a minute from time, again with Valencia assisting, as Southampton slipped to a third consecutive defeat. Everton, who remain in seventh place in the table, took time to get going, with the first half a lame affair which saw the sides cancel each other out. Maya Yoshida and Romelu Lukaku compete for a header at Goodison Park Whether it was the toll of a heavy festive schedule or a couple of early injuries which influenced that, neither seemed to help. There was a robust start to the match but that was quickly lost as Southampton's Cedric was replaced within six minutes by Jack Stephens after suffering a head knock. Dominic Calvert-Lewin of Everton and Jose Fonte of Southampton (R) battle for possession Everton's Dominic Calvert-Lewin soon followed him down the tunnel after suffering an ankle knock on his first Premier League start. With those changes, a general malaise came and there was a distinct lack of clear-cut chances in the opening exchanges. Visiting striker Jay Rodriguez did have the ball in the net, though he put it there with his hand and did little to claim otherwise as the goal was disallowed. Southampton were creating more at first, with Nathan Redmond heading just off target and Oriol Romeu later forcing a frantic clearance. Jack Stephens of Southampton (L) tackles Ramiro Funes Mori of Everton At the other end, Fraser Forster denied Lukaku with his legs and Seamus Coleman's shot deflected behind. Having put the ball in illegally before, Rodriguez showed much more craft as he had the best opportunity before the break. He spun away from Tom Davies then got past Ashley Williams and was unlucky to see his well-struck attempt from the edge of the area soar just over. The second half was also tepid - until Valencia's entry provided a spark. Enner Valencia of Everton celebrates scoring his side's first goal against Southampton Immediately he was in support of Lukaku and acted as a good decoy before the Belgian pulled a disappointing shot across goal and wide. In response, Southampton drew a fine stop from keeper Joel Robles as Redmond was denied - and that proved to be crucial as Valencia put the hosts ahead 17 minutes from the end. Coleman hit the byline and clipped back for Lukaku, whose header was saved but then rebounded back to him and came off his thigh, with Valencia tucking the loose ball in. Eight minutes later he won the penalty, which Baines stroked in. Enner Valencia (R) celebrates his goal with Kevin Mirallas and Everton team-mates Suddenly Everton looked confident and they finished the game strongly as Lukaku scored a fine third - Baines won back possession and spread to Valencia, who threaded through for the striker to make it 3-0.

Fernandinho sent off in the first half. City, who started with Sergio Aguero and David Silva on the bench, struggled in the early stages at the Etihad Stadium and were on the back foot when Fernandinho was shown his third red card in six matches for lunging in two-footed on Johann Berg Gudmundsson in the 32nd minute. Pep Guardiola called for Aguero and Silva at half-time and he got a response from City, who took the lead thanks to a rare Gael Clichy goal in the 58th minute. Aguero then doubled his side's advantage four minutes later, but it was a nervy ending for City after Ben Mee pulled a goal back 20 minutes from time. Fernandinho fouls Johann Gudmundsson of Burnley, leading to his red card Claudio Bravo made a fine late save from Michael Keane to prevent Burnley snatching a point as City held on for three valuable points that moves them back up to third ahead of Arsenal and Tottenham, who play on Tuesday and Wednesday respectively. Kelechi Iheanacho was handed a starting role in place of Aguero and he almost got on the scoresheet after being played in by Raheem Sterling, but Tom Heaton got an important hand to the ball as the striker tried to go round him. The rebound then fell to Sterling but Heaton again made a crucial intervention to round off a fine double save. Sergio Aguero watches the action from the Manchester City bench Heaton was called into action again in the 19th minute, diving to his left to keep out Yaya Toure's firmly struck shot. Minutes later Kevin De Bruyne fired wide from 20 yards as City started to take a firm hold of the game, but that all changed in the 32nd minute. The hosts were down to 10 men as Fernandinho launched himself two-footed at Gudmundsson, catching the Iceland international on the ankle. Referee Lee Mason took his time before going to his pocket and brandishing a second red card of the league campaign to the Brazilian midfielder. Referee Lee Mason dismisses Fernandinho in the first half It could have got even worse for City four minutes later as Ashley Barnes drove forward for the visitors, but the striker sliced his shot wide of Bravo's goal. Burnley were now seeing much more of the ball but it was City, despite their numerical disadvantage, who nearly broke the deadlock as Iheanacho beat the offside trap but he could not bring down Toure's pass. That proved to be Iheanacho's last involvement as Guardiola made a double change at the break with the Nigeria striker and Jesus Navas replaced by Aguero and Silva. City responded with a much improved performance and their breakthrough came just before the hour as Keane headed Bacary Sagna's cross straight to Clichy. The French left-back shifted the ball onto his right foot before striking a powerful low shot through a crowd of players and into the bottom corner for only his third Premier League goal in 311 matches. Ben Mee claimed Burnley's only goal of the game at the Etihad Within moments, City doubled their lead as Sterling raced through on goal, and although he stumbled trying to go round Heaton, the ball feel to Aguero, who found the back of the net from the tightest of angles. Despite being down to 10 men, City were in cruise control but Burnley did hit back in the 70th minute to make life uncomfortable for the hosts with Mee crashing a volley off the underside of the crossbar and in after Bravo flapped at a corner. Sergio Aguero (L) scores past Burnley's Tom Heaton There was initial confusion as play continued after the goal but referee Mason, aided by goal-line technology, eventually awarded the goal. Aguero almost made it 3-1 after a quick break from De Bruyne but Matt Lowton brilliantly blocked his shot, and it proved to be a nervy ending as Burnley pushed for an equaliser. Bravo was forced into action late on, palming over an effort from Keane, as Burnley kept the pressure on to the end.

Daniel Sturridge headed only his second Premier League goal of the season to hand the Merseysiders the lead on 19 minutes, but they were pegged back within six minutes as Jermain Defoe converted a penalty after Ragnar Klavan's foul on Didier Ndong. Sadio Mane put a dominant Liverpool side ahead on 72 minutes but he soon turned to villain, blocking a Sebastian Larsson free-kick with his arm to hand Sunderland a second penalty. Defoe made no mistake from 12 yards for the second time as the hosts claimed a vital point in their battle to avoid the drop - the Black Cats are now one point from safety. For Liverpool, who saw their four-game winning streak end, they remain second, five points adrift of Chelsea having played a game more. Liverpool made the start you would expect from a team in their league position, dominating the opening exchanges, but it was the hosts who created the first opening on six minutes as Defoe's 25-yard drive called Simon Mignolet into action. Jermain Defoe converts his penalty at the Stadium of Light to secure a crucial point for Sunderland His opposite number was then tested twice in the space of a minute, first to deny Sturridge's low effort before Georginio Wijnaldum's curling shot was tipped over. Mignolet was alert to keep Jack Rodwell's 13th-minute snap shot out, before Mannone was on hand to thwart Sturridge's curling, goal-bound effort five minutes later. Larsson was inches away from turning Adam Lallana's low cross into his own net but Sunderland's resolve would soon be broken. It proved to be third time lucky for Sturridge, though, as he reacted quickest to Dejan Lovren's scuffed shot to send a looping header over Mannone on his first Premier League start since October's draw with Manchester United. Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool (C) scores his sides first goal past Vito Mannone of Sunderland (L) But Liverpool's lead was short-lived as Ndong's purposeful run in between Wijnaldum and Klavan into the area tempted the centre-back into a clumsy challenge, and referee Anthony Taylor did not hesitate in pointing to the spot. Defoe stepped up to stroke home his 10th goal of the season, becoming the fourth player in Premier League history to achieve the feat in 10 different seasons. Jermain Defoe of Sunderland (L) scores from the spot to draw the home side level against Liverpool It should have been two moments later when Defoe latched on to Adnan Januzaj's through pass only for Mignolet to get a hand on the ball as he attempted to round the goalkeeper, before Fabio Borini made a hash of the follow up. Mannone and Sturridge continued their personal duel on 37 minutes, with the Black Cats stopper gathering a dipping effort before Wijnaldum scuffed a shot after great work from James Milner and Firmino. Liverpool took control after interval and should have restored their lead on 56 minutes when both Sturridge and Mane failed to get on the end of Nathaniel Clyne's stunning cross. Nathaniel Clyne of Liverpool (L) and Jermain Defoe of Sunderland (R) battle for possession Borini and Defoe saw shots blocked as Sunderland grew into the game, before David Moyes was incensed after Emre Can's clear handball went unpunished on 58 minutes. Sturridge and Lallana combine brilliant on 71 minutes to create an opening for the England striker to slot his second, but Mannone was on hand again to smother his effort. But, from the resulting corner, Liverpool regained the lead, Mane in the right place at the far post to turn a flick-on home. Jermain Defoe celebrates after converting his penalty to level the score at 2-2 against Liverpool The lead would last just 12 minutes though as Mane inexplicably throw his arm into the path of Larsson's free-kick, allowing Defoe to send Mignolet the wrong way. Liverpool quest for a winner proved fruitless as they lost ground in the title race, while Sunderland breathed life into their survival bid with an encouraging start to 2017.

Hull deservedly took a first-half lead through Robert Snodgrass, but their set-piece woes continued after the break as headers from Chris Brunt and Gareth McAuley fired West Brom in front. James Morrison added a third to further condemn Hull, who remain 19th and three points from safety. The result is West Brom's second comeback victory in three days meaning they stay eighth, just one point behind Everton. Chris Brunt celebrates with team-mates after levelling the score at The Hawthorns Both sides made two changes heading into the match, and there was no place in West Brom's starting line-up for Hal Robson-Kanu despite his match-winning efforts in the New Year's Eve clash against Southampton. The effects of playing just two days prior were clearly taking its toll on the hosts, who were slow out of the blocks in comparison to Hull who had enjoyed an extra day's rest. But for all of Hull's early possession, Ben Foster was only tested once in the opening 15 minutes with the West Brom 'keeper getting down well to keep out Snodgrass' free-kick. Michael Dawson then went agonisingly close with a volley from 12-yards out, but the defender could not direct his attempt on goal. Robert Snodgrass of Hull City (right) celebrates scoring his side's first goal with his Hull City team mates The visitors then took a deserved lead, with Snodgrass meeting Ahmed Elmohamady's cross to volley home on the stretch - in what was Hull's first away goal since October. West Brom's best move of the match came five minutes before the break, with Matty Phillips' header well saved by David Marshall. Hull then went on the counter with Adama Diomande denied brilliantly by McAuley, before Tom Huddlestone's 25-yard effort was parried wide by Foster. Chris Brunt celebrates his 49th-minute equaliser after scoring with a powerful header After the break, a rejuvenated West Brom took just four minutes to level proceedings, with Brunt's header flying past Marshall into the roof of the net. Just after the hour-mark, McAuley's header appeared to be blocked by Sam Clucas on the line, but Mark Clattenburg pointed to his watch to indicate that the ball had crossed the line by a matter of millimetres. Hull seemed deflated after conceding their 12th set-piece goal of the season, although a header from substitute Ryan Mason could have levelled matters with 20 minutes to go. Matt Phillips of West Brom challenges Hull's Harry Maguire Moments later, West Brom grabbed their third through Morrison, whose scrappy finish off his shin bobbled into the bottom corner past a despairing Marshall. Dawson's header was then blocked on the line by Phillips with 10 minutes remaining, but that was as close as Hull came to getting back into the match. Victory for West Brom is the third in their last five league games, while Hull last tasted success in early November.

Sofiane Feghouli was sent off by Mike Dean early on for a hefty challenge on Phil Jones, which was perhaps more worthy of a yellow, while a combination of Darren Randolph and the post kept out Antonio Valencia and Jesse Lingard's glorious chances in the first half. Half-time substitute Juan Mata put the visitors ahead following fine work from fellow sub Marcus Rashford in the 63rd minute, before Zlatan Ibrahimovic wrapped the game up with 12 minutes remaining, finishing despite initially being found in an offside position. Sofiane Feghouli makes a challenge on Phil Jones resulting in his sending off The result means Jose Mourinho's side have won their last six Premier League games, moving them to within a point of fourth-placed Arsenal, who go to Bournemouth on Tuesday. West Ham, meanwhile, are 13th. Mourinho made five changes from the side that beat Middlesbrough just two days previous, recalling centre-halves Marcos Rojo and Jones, along with Lingard, Matteo Darmian and captain Michael Carrick. David De Gea was forced into action early on to deny Manuel Lanzini's curling effort, before the controversial talking point arrived on 15 minutes. After taking a heavy touch in the final third, Feghouli left the ground to challenge Jones, who also came into the tackle strong. Jones won the ball, and Dean adjudged the tackle to be worthy of a red card, despite Feghouli not showing his studs in the challenge. West Ham retreated after the red, but the visitors struggled to break them down, bar two glorious chances within a few seconds. Getting on the end of Henrikh Mkhitaryan's cross, Valencia's effort in acres of space was just kept off the line by Randolph, before the ball rebounded out quickly to Lingard, who couldn't shape his feet to turn it on target, seeing it come off the post and into the hands of the goalkeeper. Michail Antonio is closed down by Jesse Lingard Ibrahimovic then blazed over a half volley in space from the left angle in the area, before De Gea again kept out Lanzini with an acrobatic save from the Argentine's curling effort. Michail Antonio should have put West Ham ahead on 61 minutes after being put through on goal by Lanzini, seeing his weak effort blocked by De Gea, and the hosts were made to pay two minutes later. After turning at the byline, substitute Rashford found Mata 12 yards out, and the Spaniard swiped home to finally hand Manchester United the breakthrough. Juan Mata celebrates after giving Manchester United a 1-0 lead Pogba went close twice in the space of three minutes, curling the ball just wide of the far post with his left foot in space, before directing the ball wide again from 20 yards with Randolph beaten. Rashford then hit the post as Randolph spilled his effort on the goal line, before Ibrahimovic fired home from 15 yards after the ball fell to him off Herrera, despite being in an offside position. It was an evening to forget for both West Ham and the officials, who did the hosts no favours with two controversial decisions.

Tottenham Hotspur thrashed a depleted Watford 4-1 at Vicarage Road on Sunday to keep pace with the leaders at the top of the Premier League. The England international duo were on target as the visitors warmed up for their huge clash at home to league leaders Chelsea on Wednesday night in perfect style. Despite Younes Kaboul's injury-time consolation for the Hornets, Tottenham still increased their goal difference to +23 after scoring four times on the road in consecutive league games for the first time since 1960. As a result, Mauricio Pochettino's side have now moved above Manchester City and into the top four, trailing leaders Chelsea by 10 points, while Watford have dropped to 13th. The Hornets made four changes from the team that drew 1-1 at home to Crystal Palace last time out, with Craig Cathcart, Juan Zuniga, Abdoulaye Doucoure and captain Troy Deeney all recalled. Harry Kane and Dele Alli both scored twice as Tottenham beat Watford 4-1 at Vicarage Road Harry Kane and Dele Alli both scored twice as Tottenham beat Watford 4-1 at Vicarage Road However, an already under-strength Watford were forced into making a late change to their starting line-up after Zuniga injured himself in the warm-up, with Odion Ighalo replacing him. Meanwhile, Spurs made four alterations from the side that won 4-1 at Southampton in midweek, with defenders Jan Vertonghen and Kyle Walker both suspended, meaning starts for Kieran Trippier, Toby Alderweireld and Kevin Wimmer at the back, with Moussa Sissoko and Mousa Dembele dropping down to the bench. Alli celebrates after scoring Tottenham's third goal But if Watford thought those changes were going to affect the visitors in the first half, they were mistaken as a rampant Spurs tore into their opponents right from the off. Alli came close to opening the scoring just before the half-hour mark with a rasping 25-yard drive that beat Heurelho Gomes, but not the bar, before the visitors did make a deserved breakthrough moments later. Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino has claimed the performance in the 4-1 win at Watford proves how much his side are enjoying their football Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino has claimed the performance in the 4-1 win at Watford proves how much his side are enjoying their football Trippier, who spent most of the first half playing as a right winger, found an unmarked Kane in the box with a clever ball, before the striker beat Gomes at the near post with a cool finish. Minutes later it was a case of déjà vu as Trippier was found in space on the right, before the full back's inviting centre was stabbed home by Kane in the six-yard box for his 59th goal on his 100th Premier League appearance for Spurs. The recalled Heung-Min Son could and should have further increased his side's lead, only to somehow side-foot wide of a gaping goal after being picked out by Christian Eriksen's inch-perfect free kick from the left-hand touchline. That miss was soon forgotten, though, as Alli got his first of the game, although Watford's defending for the goal left a lot to be desired as Kaboul made a hash of clearing Kane's cross from the left, before Alli nipped in ahead of Cathcart to make it 3-0 four minutes before the break. Kane celebrates with Kieran Trippier as he scores his first goal However, if that was poor defending by the home team, it got even worse just one minute into the second half as Alli scored his fifth league goal in his last three matches. The Hornets needlessly gave away possession to Kane, who then picked out Alli, totally alone in oceans of space in the box, with the 20-year-old keeping his cool to beat Gomes at his near post. Watford's Brazilian goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes vies with Kane At that point it looked like Spurs might rack up a cricket score, but with Pochettino opting to rest key men Alli, Kane and Rose for the Chelsea game, the contest petered out in the final quarter, before Kaboul's late intervention against his former club.

"report": "Arsenal 2-0 Crystal Palace Arsenal 2-0 Crystal Palace Olivier Giroud scored a contender for goal of the season as Arsenal started 2017 with a 2-0 win over Crystal Palace at the Emirates. The Frenchman's scorpion-like kick from Alexis Sanchez's cross went in off the underside of the crossbar in the 17th minute to hand the hosts a deserved lead in world-class fashion. Alex Iwobi doubled the scoreline 11 minutes into the second half, seeing his looping header creep in off Joel Ward. Giroud celebrates his world class finish Arsenal are still nine points behind Chelsea in the race for the title, while Sam Allardyce's Palace remain 17th, two points from safety. Arsene Wenger made three changes from the side that beat West Brom on Boxing Day, bringing in Nacho Monreal, Mohamed Elneny and Lucas Perez, with Mesut Ozil unwell. They should have been ahead early on through Giroud, who missed the ball from point-blank range after Monreal's fine first-time ball across the face of goal. Sanchez struck just wide from 20 yards and Wayne Hennessey saved well from Iwobi, before Giroud more than made up for his early miss. Henrikh Mkhitaryan produced a similar goal for Manchester United on Boxing Day Starting the attack in midfield with a fine flick, Giroud continued his run into the area as Sanchez moved down the left wing. Sanchez's cross was slightly behind the striker, but Giroud improvised superbly, flicking the ball from behind him with the backheel of his left foot, crashing in off the crossbar past the dive of Hennessey. It mirrored Henrikh Mkhitaryan's scorpion-like goal for Manchester United against Sunderland on Boxing Day, with Sky Sports' co-commentator Gary Neville stating Giroud's strike was \"one of the best goals\" he had ever seen. The tempo slowed after the goal, but Sanchez should have doubled Arsenal's lead on the stroke of half-time, seeing his effort from eight yards saved by the foot of Hennessey after Martin Kelly's woeful clearance. Gabriel and Christian Benteke battle for the ball Christian Benteke should have done better with a header after the break from Andros Townsend's cross, while Sanchez saw a close-range effort blocked by Scott Dann. Arsenal got their second after some woeful Palace defending, with Iwobi seeing his looping header fall softly into the net despite the visitors having both Tomkins and Joel Ward on the line. Ward, who attempted to clear the ball on the line, miscued his header, seeing it come off the crossbar and into the net. Palace then woke up; Benteke's header was well saved by Petr Cech, and the goalkeeper was then at his best to tip away Cabaye's volley. Substitute Aaron Ramsey came close late on, striking just wide from outside the area, before Hennessey saved superbly from Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's low effort from 12 yards.

"Burnley 4-1 Sunderland Burnley 4-1 Sunderland Andre Gray became the first Burnley player to score a hat-trick in the Premier League as the Clarets thrashed Sunderland 4-1 at Turf Moor. Gray capitalised on some woeful Sunderland defending to break the deadlock after 31 minutes, before adding a well-taken second six minutes after the interval. Gray's and Burnley's first Premier League treble was complete two minutes later, as he had the simple task of side-footing home after great work from Ashley Barnes, before the latter made sure of the three points with a fourth in the 67th minute from the penalty spot. Andre Gray celebrates after netting his and Burnley's third goal of the game Jermain Defoe, who was starved of service all afternoon, did manage to make the scoreline more respectable with a late consolation. The Clarets were excellent value for their win - their seventh home success of the campaign with half of the season to go. They climb to 11th, while Sunderland remain deep in the relegation mire in 18th. Sunderland were forced into a goalkeeper change ahead of the match, with Jordan Pickford ruled out for up to two months this week, but Vito Mannone, who came in for Pickford, went largely untroubled early on, as the visitors started brightly. Gray (left) celebrates giving Burnley the lead Adnan Januzaj fired over from a good position early on as the Black Cats pressed, but the defensive errors started to creep in and Burnley slowly grew into the match. Lamine Kone's withdrawal through injury did not help the cohesion the back, and Gray took full advantage just after the half-hour mark to open the scoring. John O'Shea and Papy Djilobodji both went up to meet a long ball over the top, neither made contact, allowing Gray a free run at goal to make it 1-0 with ease. Gray holds the match ball aloft after clinching his hat-trick The task became even more difficult for Burnley at half-time, as Victor Anichebe failed to emerge after injuring his hamstring, and before long Gray had compounded David Moyes' misery further by adding a second. Djilobodji this time was the guilty party, as he allowed Gray to skip past him far too easily, Mannone came rushing out of his goal, Gray beat him to it, took it round the stranded stopper, before slotting into the empty net. Two minutes later, Gray completed his 22-minute hat-trick. This was more about Burnley's slick play than Sunderland's lacklustre defending, as Barnes delightfully found Gray who made no mistake. Sunderland boss David Moyes says his side's defeat at Burnley was as bad as he has been involved in during his Premier League managerial career Sunderland boss David Moyes says his side's defeat at Burnley was as bad as he has been involved in during his Premier League managerial career Minutes later, Scott Arfield should have made it four after more tireless work from George Boyd, but it wasn't long before the Clarets were out of sight. Arfield was again involved, as he was bundled to the floor by Sebastian Larsson in the box, allowing Barnes the opportunity to net a fourth from the spot, which he converted with aplomb. Sunderland did manage a late rally, but Defoe's well-taken goal, after superb work from Januzaj to set him up, was too little, too late for the Black Cats, who once again may have to conjure up another great escape to ensure Premier League survival.

The Blues have now won 13 games in a row - the same as the Gunners side from the 2001/02 campaign - and took the lead just after 30 minutes thanks to Gary Cahill's header. But Bruno Martins Indi scored the fastest second-half goal of the season just 54 seconds after the restart to get Stoke level, before Willian scored his first of two goals ten minutes later to put the Blues back ahead. The Potters continued to test their hosts, though, with Peter Crouch scoring his first Premier League goal since the final day of the 2014/15 season in the 64th minute before Willian netted again a minute later to make it 3-2. Willian scored twice during the match at Stamford Bridge Diego Costa - returning to the side after a suspension on Boxing Day - had the final word with five minutes of normal time to play to round off the victory and send Chelsea nine points clear. The first-half was a slow burner, with a shot from N'Golo Kante - also back in the side after his one-game ban - in the seventh minute being the pick of the action from the opening exchanges. Gary Cahill celebrates scoring the opening goal with David Luiz during the Premier League thriller Lee Grant was then called into action twice in quick succession to deny Chelsea. The first came in the 19th minute as Costa rounded Mame Biram Diouf on the left of the box, but his shot was kept out by the diving chest of the goalkeeper before he collected the rebound after it came off the back of Martins Indi. He was in action again three minutes later to palm away a Cahill header before Charlie Adam saw his own headed effort skim wide from a Xherdan Shaqiri corner in the best chance of the half for Stoke. Stoke celebrate their second equaliser thanks to Peter Crouch's tap in Grant produced another heroic save in the 33rd minute to deny Costa once again. David Luiz played a sublime ball down the field that picked out the striker, who turned Ryan Shawcross before shooting, but the Stoke stopper was off his line to block the effort. He then recovered well to palm away the rebound from Eden Hazard. But Grant could do nothing about the resulting corner, as Cahill rose above the Stoke defence in the box to power home from a Cesc Fabregas corner to put the hosts in front heading into the break. It was a goal-laden second half and Stoke equalised with their first shot on target within a minute of the restart. Adam fired a delightful free kick into the box that found the head of Crouch at the back post, that the striker nodded into the path of Martins Indi who steered the ball home. Chelsea were in front again ten minutes later, though, in what was a fine team goal. Victor Moses got away from Erik Pieters on the right of the box before his low cross found Hazard in the middle. The Belgian took one touch to put the ball into the path of Willian who curled home a delightful effort through four Stoke players. Willian controls the ball during the game at Stamford Bridge With 26 minutes of the game to play, the Potters again got themselves level to give the Premier League leaders another obstacle to overcome. A great long ball from Adam found Crouch at the top of the box, who produced great control to try and find a way into the box with support from Bojan. The latter the picked out Diouf on the right, whose cross was turned home by Crouch after he got ahead of Cesar Azpilicueta. But amid the elation, Stoke switched off momentarily and allowed Chelsea to again go ahead a minute later. A loose pass from the visitors set off Fabregas towards the box, who slipped in Willian on the right and he took a few steps before hitting home from a tight angle to beat Grant. Diego Costa scored the fourth goal for Chelsea with five minutes of the game to play Both sides had chances to get the next goal as the game headed towards a thrilling conclusion, with a gut-busting break from Willian, Hazard and Costa seeing the striker power a shot over the bar before a sublime Glen Johnson cross was poked wide by Azpilicueta who was ahead of a waiting Crouch. Costa had the final say of the game though, coming with five minutes of normal time to play. A throw-in from Marcos Alonso was headed into the box by Adam, arriving at the feet of the Chelsea striker who beat both Shawcross and Martins Indi before nestling the ball into the back of the net. Willian celebrates the first of his two goals with David Luiz The Blues can now set a new Premier League record for the most consecutive wins in a single season when they face London rivals Tottenham on Wednesday evening, aiming for their 14th victory.

Islam Slimani's sixth goal of the season broke the deadlock on 20 minutes, with the Foxes well worth their half-time lead after a scintillating display. The champions were contained for much of the second period by a West Ham side - who had seen Michail Antonio strike the woodwork - looking to seal a fourth consecutive league victory. But Kasper Schmeichel and the Leicester defence were in no mood to surrender the points as they ground out a morale-boosting victory that lifts them up to 15th in the table, two points and two places adrift of West Ham and six clear of the relegation zone. Claudio Ranieri recalled Riyad Mahrez following his omission against Everton - one of three Leicester changes - while Slaven Bilic named an unchanged side following West Ham's resounding win at Swansea. However, the Hammers'exploits at the Liberty Stadium were soon a distant memory as Leicester flew out of the traps. Islam Slimani (centre) celebrates scoring Leicester's opening goal Keen to prove a point, Mahrez's venomous volley drew Darren Randolph into a fine save on two minutes, before, from a tight angle, Slimani headed Marc Albrighton's cross against the post two minutes later. Antonio spurned West Ham's first opening, volleying Aaron Cresswell's cross over from close range on 11 minutes, although a slight Wes Morgan deflection may have contributed. Despite this, Leicester retained their supremacy and took a deserved lead. Albrighton's willingness to support in attack paid dividends as he ran off Dimitri Payet and supplied the cross for Slimani to head a fine opener. Wes Morgan takes on Dimitri Payet at the King Power Stadium One so nearly became two when Angelo Ogbonna deflected Demarai Gray's cross towards goal, but Randolph kept the effort out. Albrighton then produced a sublime tackle to dispossess Payet just before he was about to shoot, following neat work from Antonio. As West Ham found some rhythm towards the end of the half, Antonio came within inches of drawing them level, only for his thunderous volley on the turn to cannon off the crossbar. Wes Morgan, Islam Slimani, Danny Drinkwater and Daniel Amartey lineup in the wall An eventful first period had a similarly eventful ending as Schmeichel and Randolph were called into action to keep free-kicks from Payet and Mahrez at bay. West Ham's hopes of a revival suffered a blow early in the second half when Noble was forced off following a rash Daniel Amartey challenge, with the Leicester midfielder fortunate not to see red. His replacement, Manuel Lanzini, almost made an immediate impact, releasing Andy Carroll with a long-range diagonal pass only for Robert Huth to dispossess the striker at the final moment. Mark Noble closes down Danny Drinkwater Cresswell came closest to getting the illusive equaliser for West Ham on 68 minutes, but Schmeichel was alert to save his deflected free-kick low on the line. For all their possession and territory, though, Leicester stood firm at the back, with Carroll's glancing header five minutes from time the closest they came to levelling.

With United trailing with five minutes remaining, Anthony Martial levelled with a finish from inside the area, before Paul Pogba's finely-placed header gave the hosts all three points just moments later. Zlatan Ibrahimovic had a goal controversially ruled out for a high foot in the first half, while Grant Leadbitter put Boro ahead midway through the second half before the dramatic finish. Anthony Martial equalises with five minutes remaining The result gives United their fifth straight Premier League victory to end 2016 on a high, while Boro are 16th, four points clear of the drop zone. Jose Mourinho made five changes from the side that beat Sunderland on Boxing Day, bringing in Anthony Martial, Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Marouane Fellaini, while in-form centre-backs Marcos Rojo and Phil Jones were replaced by Chris Smalling and Eric Bailly. Adama Traore had an early chance for Boro, poking wide from 20 yards despite having team-mates either side of him as the visitors ran through three-on-one. Grant Leadbitter celebrates giving Middlesbrough the lead United then hit the post through Pogba, whose overhead kick from Mkhitaryan's header across goal had Victor Valdes beaten but not the woodwork, while George Friend saw a volley blocked by Bailly after fine work from Traore on the right byline. Valdes then saved well from Mkhitaryan's snap-shot from outside the box and Martial hit the post with a wonderful 25-yard effort, before controversy arrived with five minutes of the first half remaining. Getting up to poke home Martial's fine left-wing cross, Ibrahimovic's strike was ruled out by referee Lee Mason for a high boot, despite not making any contact with goalkeeper Valdes. Paul Pogba takes on Grant Leadbitter (L) and Marten de Roon (R) Valdes denied Ibrahimovic after the break from close range after Pogba had fed the Swede, before Boro broke the deadlock on 67 minutes. Latching onto Alvaro Negredo's superb knock-down, Leadbitter slotted past David De Gea from 12 yards to send the travelling fans wild. Ibrahimovic nearly levelled straight away, but was again denied by Valdes low down as the ball broke to him in space in the area, while the Spaniard was at his best again to deny substitute Marcus Rashford's volley. Paul Pogba hits the post with an overhead kick in the first half Martial missed a fine chance to equalise with eight minutes remaining, failing to beat Valdes in acres of space after Mkhitaryan's superb through ball, but the Frenchman got his goal three minutes later. It was a long ball that broke Boro open, as Ibrahimovic's flick on was finished off by Martial, who wrong-footed Valdes from 12 yards out. Boro had a penalty shout seconds after the equaliser as Bailly nudged Gaston Ramirez, but Mason waved play-on to allow United to break for their winner. Pogba had plenty to do as he received Juan Mata's cross from the right, but positioned a fine header into the right corner from 10 yards as Old Trafford erupted. That's how it stayed, as Mourinho consoled his friend and former Real Madrid colleague Aitor Karanka at full-time.

Shane Long ended a run of 23 games without a goal to put Claude Puel's side in front shortly before the break but Matt Phillips levelled less than two minutes later. Robson-Kanu's stunning strike then gave the visitors their third Premier League victory of the season, with home defender Virgil van Dijk sent off for a second booking in the closing stages. The result takes West Brom past their opponents in the table to eighth place and while they had to hang on at times, their gritty performance will have pleased their manager Tony Pulis. Southampton had much of the play in the first half and although they didn't create many clear-cut openings, they were certainly the dominant side. Oriol Romeu in action against West Brom at St Mary's Stadium Sofiane Boufal put one effort over the bar but was a key component in the home team's early progress and much of their best play went through him. Dusan Tadic was also heavily involved and after a Steven Davis corner was only partially cleared by Robson-Kanu, he sent a sweet volley just wide of the target. Boufal was soon on the ball again, doing well to dispossess Phillips as he tried to run the ball out of play on the right flank. The Moroccan international burst back into the box and despite shooting from a tight angle, he almost sneaked one in past Ben Foster at the far post. Sam McQueen was also unlucky to see his low attempt pull wide after Tadic's free kick wasn't dealt with and it wasn't long before Southampton deservedly went in front. Long heads Southampton into a 1-0 lead Long put them ahead with a smart header when he got away from Allan Nyom to nod in Tadic's corner from the right to get his first goal of the season. But after eight matches between these teams in the Premier League without both sides scoring, West Brom were level just a minute and 46 seconds later. Having been culpable only moments earlier, Nyom was involved in the build-up before Chris Brunt's pass was touched on by Robson-Kanu and he set up Phillips. From there, the Scotland international cut inside past his man before placing a neat finish beyond Fraser Forster from 15 yards. Even better was to follow after the break for West Brom as they went in front themselves five minutes after the restart in spectacular fashion. Shane Long celebrates after scoring the opening goal of the game After 13 substitute appearances, Robson-Kanu was making his first start for West Brom and he marked it with a wonderful effort. Phillips released him, meaning he has now been involved in nine goals in his team's last nine games. Robson-Kanu then took a touch to control before sending a rising shot soaring into the top corner from 20 yards, leaving Forster with little chance of keeping it out. West Brom almost got a third soon after, Phillips again assisting as he crossed for substitute James Morrison to draw a good save from the keeper with a header. Robson-Kanu (R) puts West Brom in front In response, Tadic bent a lazy effort too high over the bar but his attempt did at least spark a late flurry in an effort to salvage a point. Oriol Romeu almost made it 2-2, albeit thanks to keeper Foster, whose poor clearance cannoned off the forward before running wide. Just when it seemed Southampton might level, they lost Van Dijk a minute from the end when he brought down Salomon Rondon as West Brom looked for a third on the break. His second booking effectively ended any hope of a comeback and Southampton end the year on a sour note with a second consecutive defeat and just two wins in seven games.

3-0 win away at Swansea Highlights of Bournemouth's 3-0 win away at Swansea Benik Afobe scored on his return to the Bournemouth side as the Cherries left managerless Swansea bottom of the Premier League at the end of 2016. Afobe's strike sent the away side into an early lead (25) before Ryan Fraser doubled their advantage on the stroke of half-time. Joshua King came off the bench to end his Premier League goal drought, which stretches back to August, in the 88th minute to seal the win as Eddie Howe's side bounced back from a two-game losing streak and climbed into the top half of the Premier League. Swansea, who were overseen by caretaker manager Alan Curtis after sacking Bob Bradley on Wednesday, sit four points off safety after sinking to their fourth straight defeat. Jack Wilshere surges forwards for Bournemouth at the Liberty Stadium Curtis made seven changes to the starting line-up from Bob Bradley's final game in charge, while Howe switched back to his usual 4-2-3-1 formation after back-to-back Premier League defeats. Fernando Llorente was brought in by Curtis to lead Swansea's attack after his goal against West Ham, but could only direct the home side's best chance wide when he met Naughton's cross in the 22nd minute. Bournemouth, who dominated the half, made Swansea pay just three minutes later when Afobe, in for King, was on hand to turn in the rebound after Lukasz Fabianski was forced into a quick save from Jordi Amat's skewed clearance. Highlights of Bournemouth's 3-0 win away at Swansea Jack Wilshere's influence grew as the half went on and after his neat chip set up Junior Stanislas to find the net, which was flagged offside, the on-loan Arsenal player had a hand in the Cherries' second goal. He slipped through Stanislas once again who, with only the goalkeeper to beat, unselfishly squared the ball to Fraser to score into an empty net. Stanislas almost made it three 10 minutes after the break after being slipped through by Wilshere but struck wide, before Afobe hit his effort over two minutes later after more good work from the on-loan Arsenal midfielder. Swansea City caretaker manager Alan Curtis made seven changes to their starting line-up Swansea were forced to bring on Oliver McBurnie for the injured Llorente in the second-half, but the youngster's headed efforts late on did little to test Artur Boruc in goal. With the home side piling on pressure for a comeback, King raced through from Charlie Daniels' pass to slot beyond Fabianski in the 88th minute to seal it for Bournemouth and leave Swansea a point off Hull at the foot of the table.

Man City Liverpool 1-0 Man City Liverpool capped a progressive 2016 under Jurgen Klopp with a 1-0 victory over Manchester City and reduced the gap to Premier League leaders Chelsea back to six points. Georginio Wijnaldum's eighth-minute header proved to be the difference as Klopp's men responded to Chelsea's 4-2 win over Stoke on Saturday afternoon. This was Liverpool's fourth win in a row and means they are now unbeaten in their last 17 Premier League home games (W11 D6). Georginio Wijnaldum celebrates Liverpool's opener in front of Man City supporters Meanwhile, the defeat leaves City, who failed to test Simon Mignolet with any meaningful efforts, 10 points behind Chelsea in the title race and just three ahead of rivals Manchester United. Sergio Aguero was back in the Manchester City team for the first time since picking up a four-game ban against Chelsea, while Klopp decided to give Divock Origi a rest and bring in Emre Can to give Liverpool more steel in midfield. That tactical switch worked well in the early stages with City being crowded out from finding David Silva and Kevin de Bruyne. Despite dominating the ball, the visitors looked vulnerable to Liverpool's high press and it reaped maximum reward on eight minutes. Georginio Wijnaldum gives Liverpool the lead Wijnaldum won the ball deep inside his own half and sparked the hosts into action on the counter. They worked the ball to the left wing where Adam Lallana pinged a cross straight onto the head of Wijnaldum, who powered the ball into the bottom corner. Liverpool have not lost a Premier League home game when leading at half-time since December 2009, but City gave it a good go of ending that run in the early stages of the half. Georginio Wijnaldum celebrates his early goal with team-mates They went 45 minutes without registering a shot on target but Aguero signalled their intention early on with a low drive, forcing Mignolet to divert the ball away on 52 minutes. Guardiola's side began to look menacing with Silva at the heart of their attacking play, the Spanish playmaker curling an effort inches wide on 56 minutes. However, that was as good as it got for City, whose attacking impetus fizzled out as the half wore on. Liverpool saw the match out comfortably and Klopp celebrated with a roar of appreciation towards the Kop.

Premier League encounter on Friday Night Football. The Tigers twice went in front as they looked to move to within a point of safety, with Michael Dawson putting them ahead within six minutes as he tapped home from a Robert Snodgrass corner. But a bizarre David Marshall own goal in the dying minutes of the first half saw Everton level, before Snodgrass struck a sublime free-kick, after hitting the woodwork not long before, to see Hull ahead once again. As they looked to be heading for a much-needed victory, Barkley popped up with six minutes of normal time to play to head home from a Leighton Baines cross to seal the draw for the visitors. Ross Barkley goes to celebrate after scoring Everton's second equaliser Hull briefly move off the bottom of the table ahead of the weekend fixtures - one point ahead of Swansea - while Everton remain in seventh place. Although the first half was fairly open, Hull came racing out of the traps and made the breakthrough with just six minutes on the clock to register their first goal in three games. Snodgrass delivered a corner that found an unmarked Dawson at the back post, who tapped home to put the hosts ahead. David Marshall scored a bizarre own-goal during the match Everton could have equalised on the quarter-hour mark as Seamus Coleman rattled the woodwork. It was a sublime cross from Gareth Barry that found the head of the defender to knock it goalwards, but it could only find the upright before Romelu Lukaku also saw the rebound cleared from his feet. The chances kept coming for both sides, with Dieumerci Mbokani nearly meeting a cross from Ahmed Elmohamady in the 25th minute but Coleman did enough to put him off balance before Phil Jagielka cleared the danger. At the other end, Barry slid in Barkley before the 23-year-old went for goal but it just whistled past the far post. Ronald Koeman says Everton showed a great reaction and positive character after going behind twice Ronald Koeman says Everton showed a great reaction and positive character after going behind twice Hull could have made it two just after the half-hour mark as Harry Maguire powered through the middle of the park before finding Snodgrass on the left-hand side. His cross looked destined to find Adama Diomande, but Jagielka was there to tackle and send the ball flying wide. The hosts looked set to end the half in front, but they were the masters of their own downfall in the final seconds. Mirallas whipped in a corner that was met by the fist of goalkeeper Marshall, but the ball nicked off his hand and ended up in his own net as the referee blew for half-time. Robert Snodgrass scored a sublime free kick in the second half But the Hull stopper redeemed himself in the opening minutes after the break to deny Everton the lead. Mirallas raced through midfield before laying the ball off to Lukaku with the striker going for goal - but Marshall was there to produce a sublime save and push the effort onto the crossbar. The woodwork was rattled again 10 minutes into the half as Snodgrass fired a masterful free kick onto the crossbar, with Diomande attempting to bicycle kick the rebound but fired it wide. Michael Dawson celebrates scoring his side's first goal of the game with Curtis Davies There was no denying him a second time, though, as the Scotsman fired home in the 65th minute. Baines had fouled Maguire around 25 yards from goal and Snodgrass stepped up to take, firing a thunderbolt free kick into the top corner to see the hosts back ahead. Both sides continued to push for the next goal, but it was Everton who made the breakthrough in the 84th minute. Baines put in a delightful cross from the left-hand side that was met by the unmarked Barkley at the back post, who headed home to get the visitors back on level terms. The Toffees could have dealt the killer blow on the stroke of the 90th minute as Coleman raced down the right flank before his cross found Dominic Calvert-Lewin, but he was slightly off balance and fired his effort wide of the post to see the points shared at the KCOM Stadium.

points after coming from behind to beat Stoke City 4-1 at Anfield on Tuesday. Christmas may be over but Stoke dished out the gifts in a performance littered with defensive errors and Liverpool took full advantage to move back above Manchester City into second. Jonathan Walters punished some questionable goalkeeping by Simon Mignolet on 12 minutes but a Glenn Johnson mistake let in Adam Lallana for the equaliser. Adam Lallana celebrates with Georginio Wijnaldum after scoring the equaliser Roberto Firmino, who started despite being charged with drink-driving on Christmas Eve, made it 2-1 just before the break before a Giannelli Imbula own goal and Daniel Sturridge's first Premier League goal of the season - courtesy of a shocking back-pass from Ryan Shawcross - wrapped up the points for Jurgen Klopp's men. Sturridge had to make do with a place on the bench as Klopp named an unchanged side from their 1-0 victory over Everton at Goodison Park. Reaction from captain Jordan Henderson and Daniel Sturridge after Liverpool's 4-1 victory over Stoke at Anfield Reaction from captain Jordan Henderson and Daniel Sturridge after Liverpool's 4-1 victory over Stoke at Anfield However, it was Mark Hughes' men that looked the sharper in the early stages and they were ahead with just 12 minutes on the clock. There has been much debate about who should be Liverpool's first-choice goalkeeper and questions will be asked again after Mignolet was beaten too easily at his near post by Walters, who met a near-post cross by Eric Pieters. Jonathan Walters celebrates with team-mates as he scores their first goal Liverpool looked rattled and Stoke continued to press. Joe Allen forced Mignolet into a low save six minutes later and Liverpool were lucky that rebound didn't fall to Peter Crouch, who would have had a tap-in. The hosts needed inspiration and their go-to guy Lallana stepped up, scoring his fourth goal in his last four games when Sadio Mane crossed from the right flank and Johnson inexplicably decided to control the ball rather than clear his lines. The ball broke kindly to Lallana and from a tight angle he fired home past Lee Grant at his near post (34). Lallana shoots past Stoke goalkeeper Lee Grant The goal lifted the atmosphere in the home ends at Anfield and their team soon took the lead. Firmino was available for selection despite his off-field misdemeanour and he repaid the faith showed in him from the club with a fine low finish from 15 yards that hit both posts on its way into the net (44). Roberto Firmino makes it 2-1 to Liverpool Stoke came out for the second half still very much in the game but shot themselves in the foot with two defensive mistakes that gifted Liverpool the points. Firmino scored Liverpool's second Imbula's misplaced header on 59 minutes sparked a Liverpool counter attack, where Jordan Henderson found Divock Origi, who rolled the ball across goal only for Imbula to turn home under pressure from Mane. Jurgen Klopp says the scoreline flattered his side in their 4-1 win over Stoke, saying it was a very difficult game to win Jurgen Klopp says the scoreline flattered his side in their 4-1 win over Stoke, saying it was a very difficult game to win It went from bad to worse for Stoke 11 minutes later as Shawcross' back-pass was seized upon by Sturridge, who had only been on the pitch for 90 seconds. The England striker stayed calm and dribbled past Grant before sliding home into the empty net, his first top-flight goal since April a milestone one; Liverpool have now scored 100 league goals during Jurgen Klopp's 48 matches.

scored his 100th goal for Watford to earn his side a 1-1 draw and deny Sam Allardyce a winning start as Crystal Palace manager. Yohan Cabaye gave Allardyce, who was appointed on Friday following the sacking of Alan Pardew, the perfect start, firing home in the 26th minute to give the visitors a deserved lead. It could have got even better for Palace in the 36th minute but Christian Benteke, who was brought down in the penalty area by Heurelho Gomes, saw his penalty saved by the Brazilian goalkeeper. Buoyed by the penalty miss, Watford, who were forced into two substitutions in the opening 15 minutes, responded in good fashion and they were awarded a penalty of their own with 20 minutes remaining when Sebastian Prodl was bundled to the floor by Damien Delaney. Sam Allardyce says he regards Crystal Palace's 1-1 draw with Watford as two points dropped after going ahead in the first half Sam Allardyce says he regards Crystal Palace's 1-1 draw with Watford as two points dropped after going ahead in the first half Deeney made no mistake from the spot to end a run of 10 games without a goal and in the process become only the fifth player to score 100 goals for Watford. The point moves Watford into the top 10 for now, while Crystal Palace stay 17th, two points clear of the relegation places. Troy Deeney applauds the fans as he leaves the pitch Allardyce made two changes in naming his first Palace side with Mathieu Flamini and Andros Townsend coming in to the side in place of Joe Ledley and James McArthur. Troy Deeney says it was fantastic to finally score his 100th goal for Watford against Crystal Palace, while Heurelho Gomes labelled the draw a great point Troy Deeney says it was fantastic to finally score his 100th goal for Watford against Crystal Palace, while Heurelho Gomes labelled the draw a great point Walter Mazzarri also made two changes with Adlene Guedioura and Daryll Janmaat replacing Deeney and Juan Camilo Zuniga, but any plans the Italian boss made before kick-off went out the window very early on. Odion Ighalo of Watford evades a challenge from Mathieu Flamini of Crystal Palace In the second minute Wilfried Zaha burst down the left, forcing Janmaat into a sliding tackle. The Dutchman overstretched in making the tackle, tweaking a muscle and he was eventually replaced by Zuniga. Scott Dann says Crystal Palace should have killed the game off after going ahead against Watford Scott Dann says Crystal Palace should have killed the game off after going ahead against Watford Things immediately went from bad to worse for the hosts as Valon Behrami went down clutching his left hamstring and he was replaced by Deeney, meaning Watford became the fourth team in Premier League history to substitute two starting players in the opening 15 minutes. Sam Allardyce looks on before the Premier League match between Watford and Crystal Palace Palace, who started extremely brightly, took full advantage in the 26th minute as Townsend drove ate heart of the Watford defence, before slipping the ball through to Cabaye, who beat the offside trap and smashed a first-time shot past Gomes and into the far corner. Yohan Cabaye of Crystal Palace celebrates with team-mates after scoring the opening goal The visitors had the opportunity to double their advantage 10 minutes later when Benteke latched onto Prodl's back pass ahead of Gomes, who brought the Belgium international down in the penalty area. Walter Mazzarri says considering Watford had two injured players within the first 10 minutes, he was very pleased with his side’s draw against Crystal Palace Walter Mazzarri says considering Watford had two injured players within the first 10 minutes, he was very pleased with his side’s draw against Crystal Palace Referee Mark Clattenburg pointed to the spot but Benteke's tame effort was easily saved by Gomes, diving low down to his left. Christian Benteke sees his penalty saved by Heurelho Gomes The miss lifted Watford and their fans and they eventually levelled in the 70th minute when Delaney needlessly brought down Prodl to leave referee with little choice but to award the game's second penalty. Substitute Deeney, who had unexpectedly had been left out of the starting line-up, made absolutely no mistake, powerfully striking the ball straight down the middle to bring the scores level. Troy Deeney equalises for Watford from the penalty spot In the 83rd minute, Odion Ighalo headed Guedioura's cross goalwards but Hennessey was well-positioned to make an easy save. Palace though they should have had a penalty late on when Zaha went down under a challenge from Miguel Britos but Clattenburg gave a free-kick to the hosts and booked the Crystal Palace forward for a dive. Wilfried Zaha breaks away under pressure from Adlene Guedioura and Jose Holebas An increasingly scrappy end to the game ensured and neither team could find a winning goal, leaving Palace with a record of one win in last 11, and Watford with two in their last eight.

Arsene Wenger's men led the Premier League on January 1 but it's been another 12 months of underachievement and this result epitomised that frustration up until Giroud's late winner on his first Premier League start of the season. Ben Foster starred for the resilient Baggies, making a string of saves early in the second half while Alexis Sanchez also struck the post for the hosts. Olivier Giroud's header loops over Ben Foster The victory moves Arsenal, who had lost their two previous games, into third but they remain nine points behind Chelsea in the title race.

Alexis Sanchez struck the post for Arsenal in the second half The visitors carried little threat but Claudio Yacob missed a glorius opportunity at the back post on 71 minutes when he fired high and wide after Cech spilled a corner. There seemed no way through for the Gunners, who continued to probe but lacked a killer final ball against Tony Pulis' men who ran the clock down at every opportunity.

10-game goal drought to hand Burnley a narrow 1-0 Boxing Day victory over Middlesbrough at Turf Moor. The Clarets striker drew a line under what has been a testing campaign - marred by bans and injuries - with a sweetly-struck volley that proved too hot for Boro goalkeeper Victor Valdes to handle 10 minutes from time. The 25-year-old's first goal since August 20 proved to be a fitting winner in a game bereft of clear-cut chances for either of last season's top two in the Sky Bet Championship. After only their second victory in seven games, Burnley leapfrog Middlesbrough into 14th in the Premier League while opening up a two-point gap over the Teessiders, who now occupy 15th place. Andre Gray shoots on goal to give Burnley a 1-0 lead Burnley defender Jon Flanagan and Boro forward Cristhian Stuani were recalled to their sides as both managers made one change from their last outings against Tottenham and Swansea respectively. After Marten de Roon had set the tone by receiving a booking for a firm challenge on Stephen Ward, Stuani was straight into the action, whistling a venomous volley inches wide after 12 minutes. Burnley boss Sean Dyche gives his reaction on his sides late 1-0 win over Boro at Turf Moor Burnley boss Sean Dyche gives his reaction on his sides late 1-0 win over Boro at Turf Moor Ashley Barnes drew Valdes into action on 23 minutes with a low, skimming effort as Burnley grew into the game before the hosts had a penalty appeal rejected after the ball appeared to striker Calum Chambers' arm after a melee in the area. George Boyd then stung Valdes' palms with a rasping drive on the half hour before the game threatened to boil over as both sides ended the half with two players booked following a series of robust challenges. Flanagan's forceful challenge on Gaston Ramirez on 50 minutes ensured the first-half needle was reinstated after the interval, he too received a caution. It took until 64 minutes for either side to fashion a chance, with Stuani's glancing header drawing Tom Heaton into a flying save.

All that, however, was put to one side 10 minutes from time as Gray rounded off a simple route-one move to put Burnley ahead.

The Blues went into the game six points clear of Liverpool in second and despite a good challenge from the Cherries, were able to maintain their spot at the top of the table and make history in the process. It was a stunning curler from Pedro in the 24th minute that sent Chelsea on their way to another victory, before Eden Hazard netted from the spot after being fouled by Simon Francis minutes into the second half. The Spaniard rounded off a great afternoon for the Blues with a deflected third in the last minute of injury-time, with Chelsea now nine points clear ahead of Liverpool and Manchester City - who are yet to play - while Bournemouth slip into 13th place. Chelsea went 12 games unbeaten in the Premier League on Boxing Day to break their club record Antonio Conte was without the suspended Diego Costa and N'Golo Kante for the Christmas clash, with Pedro and Cesc Fabregas replacing them and they were certainly changes that proved fruitful for the Italian manager. The first chance of the game came from the hosts in the seventh minute. Chelsea were awarded a free-kick which was taken quickly by Fabregas, picking out the run of Pedro between the two centre-backs but Francis got there ahead of the forward to see the ball wide. Pedro in action against Simon Francis during the game Josh King almost latched onto the end of an Adam Smith cross just after the quarter hour mark, but Cesar Azpilicueta was there ahead of him to see out the fizzing effort. Seven minutes later, David Luiz released Pedro with a delightful through-ball, but after a gut-busting run from the Spaniard, the defender could not latch onto his cross at the back post and the ball dashed wide.

But within 60 seconds, Pedro produced a moment of magic to put the Blues ahead. Chelsea took a short corner and did not look to be able to find their way through another tightly-packed area, but some one touch football between Hazard and Fabregas found Pedro at the top of the box. He wriggled into space and went for goal, curling a sublime effort into the top corner. The Cherries were not to be put off though and continued to push their hosts, with Thibaut Courtois producing a fine low save in the 27th minute to keep out a great hit from Jack Wilshere, before the Arsenal loanee also hit just wide after a poor defensive header from Nemanja Matic fell into his path. Eddie Howe was disappointed after Bournemouth missed several first half chances in their 3-0 defeat at Stamford Bridge. Eddie Howe was disappointed after Bournemouth missed several first half chances in their 3-0 defeat at Stamford Bridge. The half ended in controversy and Wilshere was involved again, as he was fouled at the top of the box by Gary Cahill with referee Mike Jones appearing to wave play on, before Brad Smith shot way over the bar. The referee then pulled the play back for a free-kick, much to the dismay of the Blues who questioned his earlier decision to see the play continue. However, Bournemouth did take the free-kick but it fired straight into the wall as the whistle went for the end of the first half. Eden Hazard doubles Chelsea's lead from the penalty spot It did not take look for Chelsea to double their lead in the second period, with Francis fouling Hazard three minutes after the restart to concede the penalty. It was the Belgian who stepped up and expertly dispatched past Artur Boruc to seal his 50th Premier League goal. They could have added a third six minutes later, as the Blues once again hit their visitors on the break. Willian raced forward and picked out Hazard on the left flank who was barely closed down as he made his way into the box, but his fizzing cross just evaded the toe of Pedro. Adam Smith fires a free kick into the wall at Stamford Bridge Boruc was kept on his toes throughout the second half and produced a string of fine saves, denying Willian just before the hour mark as he tested the goalkeeper on a tight angle before Victor Moses hit wide on the volley not long after. Courtois had little to do in the game, but was reliable when called upon and kept Bournemouth out for a second time in the 74th minute. Wilshere played a sublime ball that cut through the Blues defence to find substitute Benik Afobe in the box, but the Belgian goalkeeper was off his line quickly to deny the forward a goal. Eden Hazard scored his 50th Premier League goal on Boxing Day The game was meandering towards a conclusion before Pedro grabbed his second of the game and the third for Chelsea in the 93rd minute. Another strong break from the hosts saw the Spaniard on his way, with his shot from the top of the box deflecting off Steve Cook and Harry Arter before finding its way into the back of the net to seal a historic win for the Blues.

As a result, Claudio Ranieri's side have slipped to 16th in the table, just three points above the relegation zone, while Everton have moved up to seventh place.

However, in a desperately disappointing first half, one of the few highlights was the sight of the suspended Vardy wearing one of the face masks bearing his own face that the club's owners had placed on every seat in the stadium ahead of kick-off in protest at the appeal over the striker's three-game ban being rejected. Everton's Ronald Koeman says his side controlled the game and deserved a 2-0 win over Leicester Everton's Ronald Koeman says his side controlled the game and deserved a 2-0 win over Leicester The champions began the contest playing with pace, closing down their opponents at will, with first Daniel Amartey testing Robles with a low drive from 25 yards, before Demarai Gray - in for Mahrez - flashed an effort just past the Spaniard's far post. Other than that, it was the assured display of Chilwell on his Premier League debut that was the main talking point at the break, with the 20-year-old outstanding at the back for the Foxes. Jamie Vardy masks are left on the seats ahead of the match at King Power But the contest really came to life after Mirallas's 51st-minute strike broke the deadlock, the visitors' first effort on target in the game, although Ranieri will be furious with his team's defending for the goal. Robles launched a long ball upfield that somehow made its way through to the Belgian, who then kept his cool to beat Kasper Schmeichel with a low drive from the right-hand edge of the area, albeit with the help of a crucial deflection off Wasilewski's leg.

Again it came from a routine clearance by Robles for Lukaku to fight for with Wes Morgan near the right-hand touchline, a battle that the powerful frontman won hands down as he brushed aside his marker's attentions. After that there was only ever going to be one result with Lukaku bursting into the box, turning Wasilewski inside out, before easily beating Schmeichel as Leicester suffered their ninth loss of the season, three times as many as they managed in the whole of the previous campaign.

Utd 3-1 Sunderland Man Utd 3-1 Sunderland A stunning finish from Henrikh Mkhitaryan was the highlight as Manchester United beat Sunderland 3-1 in the Premier League on Boxing Day. The Armenian, a second-half substitute, improvised superbly to flick home Zlatan Ibrahimovic's cross with his heel, although he was standing in an offside position. Daley Blind had given United a first-half lead with his first goal since January, finishing into the bottom corner from inside the area after Ibrahimovic's neat assist. Daley Blind celebrates putting United ahead Ibrahimovic scored United's second on 81 minutes, turning home after being put through on goal by Paul Pogba, before Mkhitaryan's world class finish with four minutes left. Fabio Borini volleyed home a stunning consolation for Sunderland from 25 yards, but the result means the hosts have now won four Premier League games on the trot, while the Black Cats are 18th, a point off safety. Jose Mourinho reflects on Manchester United's 3-1 win over Sunderland Jose Mourinho reflects on Manchester United's 3-1 win over Sunderland Wayne Rooney was left out of the United squad through injury, while Blind started at the expense of Matteo Darmian. Zlatan Ibrahimovic had doubled United's lead Pogba forced an early save out of Jordan Pickford before David de Gea did well to beat away Patrick van Aanholt's free-kick from just outside the box. Pogba then hit the post as his curling effort deflected off the boot of Seb Larsson, while at the other end Sunderland nearly took the lead themselves, seeing De Gea block Victor Anichebe's close-range effort on the turn. David De Gea makes a save from Patrick van Aanholt's free-kick United midfielder Pogba had another first-half effort go agonisingly close, this time through a half-volley that flew inches over Pickford's bar, but the hosts finally took the lead after 39 minutes. Breaking into the area from his defensive position, Blind fired superbly into the bottom corner from 15 yards after Ibrahimovic had fed him for his first United assist. David Moyes says Sunderland gave away two goals as they fell to a 3-1 defeat to Manchester Utd at Old Trafford David Moyes says Sunderland gave away two goals as they fell to a 3-1 defeat to Manchester Utd at Old Trafford Pogba went close again before the break but was denied by Pickford again after his creative flick and volley in the box, while Juan Mata saw his free-kick beat away by the promising young goalkeeper in injury time. After the break, France international Pogba headed narrowly over, before Pickford saved superbly from Ibrahimovic after he was put through on goal by Mkhitaryan. Paul Pogba goes for goal in the first half Ibrahimovic got his goal with nine minutes remaining, sticking the ball beyond Pickford after being played in by Pogba, who had robbed the ball from Sunderland in midfield. Mkhitaryan then produced his goal of the season contender, although he was a yard offside from Ibrahimovic's ball from the right. With the cross slightly behind him, the former Borussia Dortmund forward improvised to send the ball into the far corner with a flick of the right boot. Henrikh Mkhitaryan scores Manchester United's third goal with an acrobatic effort There was time for Sunderland to grab a superb consolation through Borini, who chested and volleyed into the top left corner past De Gea from 25 yards.

4-1 win over Swansea at the Liberty Stadium on Boxing Day. Andre Ayew returned to haunt his former club after 13 minutes, tapping home his first goal for West Ham to set the Hammers on course for a third league victory in a row. Winston Reid made it two five minutes after the break before Michail Antonio made sure of the win 12 minutes from time, capitalising on more poor defending from the home side. Winston Reid celebrates after doubling West Ham's lead Fernando Llorente's late strike proved to be a mere consolation, as Andy Carroll netted a fourth in stoppage time to a chorus of boos around the Liberty. Slaven Bilic congratulates his players after West Ham's \"best performance\" of the season as they won 4-1 away at Swansea Slaven Bilic congratulates his players after West Ham's \"best performance\" of the season as they won 4-1 away at Swansea The result sees Swansea sit four points from safety, with questions over Bradley's suitability to the role remaining. West Ham are up to 11th after their success in south Wales. Swansea started well, but were caught on the break as the Hammers took the lead through a familiar face to Swans followers. Gylfi Sigurdsson strikes a free kick over a wall of West Ham players A long ball towards the back post was met firmly by Carroll, who headed across goal, Lukasz Fabianski could only parry the ball into the path of Ayew, who could not miss from a few yards out. Antonio went close to finding a second minutes later, but was inches away from connecting at the back post. Record Swansea signing Borja Baston then did superbly to work space for the shot, but sliced the ball wide as his search for a first goal in English football goes on. Andre Ayew scores the opening goal for West Ham Darren Randolph was called into action three minutes before the break, superbly denying Gylfi Sigurdsson from a free-kick as frustration grew around the Liberty. After the interval, Swansea continued to be the architects of their own downfall, and it was not long before Reid headed the Hammers' second, beating three defenders to a corner to steer the ball home. Randolph was then at his best to deny Swansea twice in four minutes, with his stop from Jack Cork's strike the pick of the lot. Wayne Routledge (middle) tussles with Mark Noble It was game, set and match 12 minutes from time as Antonio diverted a drilled Havard Nordtveit strike home, despite appearing to think he was offside. In fact, Nathan Dyer was too slow to get out behind him, playing the versatile Hammer onside for his eight goal of the season. Randolph again was forced to deny Angel Rangel with a smart stop, before he was finally beaten in stoppage time by Swansea substitute Llorente, after great work from Dyer to pick him out. The three-goal winning margin was restored less than a minute later in stoppage time, though, as Carroll was allowed far too much time to bring the ball down and scuff his strike past the despairing dive of Fabianski. Andy Carroll celebrates scoring his team's fourth goal The Swansea faithful let their feelings be known at the death, and it remains to be seen if Bradley will be afforded time to turn things around in the coming transfer window.

The hosts kept City at bay until Andrew Robertson's clumsy challenge on Raheem Sterling allowed Yaya Toure to break the deadlock from the penalty spot after 72 minutes.

Pep Guardiola made four changes from the victory over Arsenal, with Fernandinho returning from his three-match suspension, while Mike Phelan kept faith with the starting XI defeated at West Ham. John Stones was forced off in the first half with a knee injury The visitors, who lost John Stones to a first-half knee injury, were once again without Sergio Aguero - serving the final match of his four-game ban - and lacked a cutting edge in the first half as they were left frustrated. Guardiola opted for Kevin De Bruyne, Sterling and Nolito in attack, but the trio were largely restricted to shots from distance. Hull goalkeeper David Marshall's one save of note before the break came from Toure's dipping free-kick after just seven minutes. Kelechi Iheanacho is congratulated by his City team-mates after scoring the second goal against Hull Phelan's relegation battlers started the second half brightly as Harry Maguire hooked a volley over Claudio Bravo's crossbar before Michael Dawson's looping header was cleared off the line by Bacary Sagna. De Bruyne struck the post down the other end and Hull were ultimately made to pay for their failure to capitalise on their best spell of the game when Toure put City ahead.

Iheanacho, who had replaced Nolito, added a quickfire second, turning past Marshall from close range after excellent work from Silva and De Bruyne.

The Senegalese forward was on hand to turn the ball home from close range after substitute Daniel Sturridge's shot from the edge of the area had hit the post. Liverpool dominated large chunks of the clash at Goodison Park, but opportunities were limited until the late show by Jurgen Klopp's side.

The result means that Liverpool move back up to second in the Premier League table, six points behind leaders Chelsea. Everton, meanwhile, stay ninth. It was a typical blood-and-thunder start to the Merseyside derby but, despite plenty of energy and attacking endeavour, chances were few and far between in the first half. Liverpool players celebrate Mane's winner A good move from Liverpool saw Divock Origi flash an effort wide after 37 minutes, while Ramiro Funes Mori found himself unmarked at a corner just before the break, but he could only head wide. The second half began at a similar pace to the first, with Liverpool dominating from the off, but still there was a lack of goalmouth action.

And they nearly did just that after 80 minutes as Firmino's volley from James Milner's corner appeared to be destined for the net, but substitute goalkeeper Joel Robles did superbly to get down to his left and keep out the Brazilian. Roberto Firmino attempts an acrobatic effort But with eight minutes of injury time indicated, Liverpool found a winner when Mane reacted quicker than any Everton defender in the box to finish into an empty net after Sturridge had rattled the woodwork. Liverpool then had a glorious opportunity to make it two, but Seamus Coleman managed to scurry back onto his line to deny Firmino, meaning Klopp's side secured a first 1-0 Premier League win of 2016.

Southampton Bournemouth 1-3 Southampton Jay Rodriguez's first Premier League double in more than two-and-a-half-years was the difference as Southampton came from behind to beat south-coast rivals Bournemouth 3-1 at the Vitality Stadium. Rodriguez put the Saints ahead on 48 minutes, converting from close range after great work from substitute Steven Davis, before he made sure of victory with a thunderous drive five minutes from time. Reaction from Jay Rodriguez after Southampton's win at Bournemouth Reaction from Jay Rodriguez after Southampton's win at Bournemouth Nathan Ake had given Bournemouth an eighth-minute lead but, after Ryan Bertrand's fine equaliser on 14 minutes, the Cherries were second best as Southampton claimed only their second away win of the season. The result sees Claude Puel's men climb up to seventh in the Premier League, three places and three points ahead of Bournemouth who remain in 10th. Rodriguez hadn't scored in the Premier League since August Eddie Howe recalled Callum Wilson into the Bournemouth line-up after he missed Tuesday's victory over Leicester, while Puel make six changes to the Southampton side that were held to a goalless draw by 10-man Stoke on Wednesday. And the wholesale changes appeared to have an effect on the Saints as Bournemouth drew first blood on six minutes. Claude Puel praised his Southampton side's performance Claude Puel praised his Southampton side's performance Ake ghosted in front of Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg at the far post to head Jack Wilshere's cross beyond Fraser Forster, scoring his third goal in his last six Premier League appearances. It was a landmark goal for Wilshere too as he registered his first league assist since September 2014. Nathan Ake puts Bournemouth 1-0 up with a diving header But the Cherries' lead was short-lived as Bertrand singlehandedly broke down the left, checked inside Adam Smith, past Simon Francis and rifled the ball past Artur Boruc. The goal steadied Saints and they should have taken the lead on 30 minutes, but Nathan Redmond sliced Bertrand's fine cut-back wide. Ryan Bertrand (second L) celebrates scoring Saints' equaliser Francis' poor clearance presented Redmond with another chance to put Saints ahead on 46 minutes, but the winger dithered in possession, allowing a block to take the sting out of the shot on its way through to Boruc. Having been brought on at half-time, though, substitute Davis was more alert and delivered the impact his manager wanted as the Saints hit the front. Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe felt his side didn't play to their level Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe felt his side didn't play to their level The Northern Irishman gathered Sofiane Boufal's back-heel to get in behind the Bournemouth defence, committed Boruc into a dive before chipping the ball towards goal where Rodriguez converted into the unguarded net. Bournemouth had the chance to respond immediately but Wilson steered a first-time shot onto the roof of the Southampton goal after Joshua King's break. Rodriguez and team-mate Nathan Redmond celebrate Southampton's third goal at the Vitality Stadium Boruc was on hand to deny Rodriguez a second after he robbed the ball off Steve Cook on 57 minutes, before Ake blocked Hojbjerg's goal-bound volley off the line 10 minutes later. Bournemouth continued to offer little by means of a reply as Redmond whistled a dipping effort just over on 80 minutes. Rodriguez scores his second and Southampton's third goal And the game was finally put beyond the Cherries as Rodriguez instinctively turned on the edge of the area and lashed an unstoppable drive into the back of the net, sealing his first Premier League double since March 2014.

The visitors had deservedly led at the break thanks to Theo Walcott's early strike, only to throw away their advantage for the second match in a row. Leroy Sane brought City level straight after half-time, before Raheem Sterling won the game with a goal 19 minutes from time. As a result, the home team have jumped up to second in the table, albeit still seven points behind pace-setters Chelsea, while the Gunners have dropped to fourth. Raheem Sterling and Yaya Toure reflect on Man City's 2-1 win at home to Arsenal Raheem Sterling and Yaya Toure reflect on Man City's 2-1 win at home to Arsenal Arsenal opted to stiffen up their midfield by bringing in Alex Iwobi for Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain in the one alteration from the team that suffered their first away defeat of the season at Everton on Tuesday night. Meanwhile, City made two changes from the side that beat Watford 2-0 in midweek, Fernando replacing Ilkay Gundogan, who suffered a serious knee injury in that game, and Sane coming in for Nolito. Theo Walcott scores his team's first goal past Manchester City's Chilean goalkeeper Claudio Bravo However, for the first time this season, Pep Guardiola kept the same back five for two league games in a row after their shut-out against the Hornets, meaning John Stones had to once again settle for a place on the substitutes' bench. That continuity in defence made little difference, though, as Arsenal opened the scoring just five minutes in after a quick-fire move that took just 16 seconds to go from back to front. Petr Cech started the move by rolling the ball out to Hector Bellerin, who strode forward unchallenged into the City half before finding Alexis Sanchez. Man City boss Pep Guardiola insists his team played very well and deserved their 2-1 win against Arsenal Man City boss Pep Guardiola insists his team played very well and deserved their 2-1 win against Arsenal The Chile international's brilliant reverse pass then picked out Walcott's run in the box, with the forward making no mistake to score his 11th goal in all competitions this campaign, and his fourth in his last four games against City. However, that lead was very nearly wiped out within minutes as City worked the ball out wide to Kevin De Bruyne and the Belgian's brilliant cross from the left was somehow headed wide of the gaping goal by Sterling, playing the lone front role in place of the suspended Sergio Aguero. Leroy Sane (C) is congratulated after his first goal for Manchester City drew them level against Arsenal Incredibly, it took the home team until the final minute of the first half to have their first effort on target, a Yaya Toure header straight at Cech, as the Gunners looked to produce a repeat performance to when they won 2-0 at City in January 2015. But all the visitors' good work in the first half was soon forgotten when City drew level two minutes after the interval as the Gunners went a 12th game in a row without keeping a clean sheet. Sterling, who swapped places in attack with De Bruyne at half-time, drove forward with purpose into the Arsenal half, before exchanging passes with David Silva, and the diminutive Spain playmaker's through ball then found Sane running clean through on goal. Raheem Sterling's low strike gives Manchester City the lead at the Etihad Stadium The flag stayed down, with Laurent Koscielny deemed to just be playing Sane onside, and the German kept his cool to toe-poke the ball past the advancing Cech for his first-ever goal for City as the home side made the perfect start to the second period. That strike completely altered the flow of the contest, with City not only quickest to every ball thereafter, but also winning every 50-50 challenge, while Arsenal just could not get out of their own half. Petr Cech admits that the past week for Arsenal has been very disappointing after defeats to Everton and Manchester City. Petr Cech admits that the past week for Arsenal has been very disappointing after defeats to Everton and Manchester City. Cech, who had been a virtual spectator before the break, was now being called upon just to keep his side on level terms, with the Czech Republic goalkeeper making impressive stops to keep out first Sane and then De Bruyne as the game entered its final quarter. Arsene Wenger reacted to the one-way nature of the second half by introducing the pace of Oxlade-Chamberlain for Iwobi, only for his side to soon find themselves behind as Arsenal threw away a lead on the road for the second game in a row. Raheem Sterling celebrates scoring City's winning goal De Bruyne started the move with a sensational crossfield pass to pick out Sterling on the right flank, although the forward still had much to do as he drove at the retreating Nacho Monreal. However, as the Spain defender backed off his man, Sterling took full advantage to cut inside, before firing a low shot past Cech at his near post as City's pressure after the break brought its rewards. City then brought on the Jesus Navas for the tiring Sane and the winger almost made an instant impression after finding De Bruyne from his position on the right flank, only for the Belgium international to beat Cech from a tight angle, but not the post. But Arsenal, who lost Oxlade-Chamberlain to injury, failed to make City pay for that miss as the home team held on to record what could be a vital win in the race for the title.

pressure on the Premier League's top four with a 2-1 win against Burnley on Sunday afternoon. Burnley took a surprise lead in the 21st minute through Ashley Barnes, but Dele Alli replied six minutes later. Despite resolute defending from Sean Dyche's side in the second half, Rose secured all three points with a powerful effort 19 minutes from time. Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino says his side fully deserved the three points after coming from behind to beat Burnley Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino says his side fully deserved the three points after coming from behind to beat Burnley The result means Tottenham stay in fifth, just one point behind both Arsenal and Liverpool - who play Everton on Mersey Monday. Burnley remain 16th and three points above the relegation zone. Tottenham head coach Mauricio Pochettino brought Mousa Dembele back into the team, but were without defender Toby Alderweireld, who had to pull out shortly before kick-off. Harry Winks made his second Premier League start of the season. Burnley boss Sean Dyche was frustrated to lose at Tottenham after a good performance and added that Moussa Sissoko should have been sent off Burnley boss Sean Dyche was frustrated to lose at Tottenham after a good performance and added that Moussa Sissoko should have been sent off For Burnley, Johann Gudmundsson was not in the matchday squad due to a hamstring injury, while Steven Defour was on the bench. Spurs started the match brightly as Alli blazed a glorious chance over the bar in just the second minute, before fullbacks Kyle Walker and Rose started causing Burnley's wide players significant problems. Ashley Barnes gave Burnley a surprise lead However, shortly after Andre Gray forced Hugo Lloris into a wonderful reflex save, Burnley took the lead in the 21st minute. Scott Arfield intercepted a Winks pass deep in Tottenham's half, with George Boyd drilling the ball in for Barnes to poke in a surprise opener. Just five minutes later, Alli equalised after Walker surged down the right flank and drilled the ball low into the box for the 20-year-old to get his fourth Premier League goal of the season. Dele Alli scored a quick equaliser in the first half Tottenham then continued their pressure on Burnley's goal having 19 shots in the first half. The closest Spurs came to taking the lead was through Harry Kane, whose powerful shot was scrambled away by Tom Heaton. Early in the second half there were calls for a penalty after Gray appeared to be brought down by Eric Dier, but referee Kevin Friend said no penalty. Dier looked to have just touched the ball before making contact with Gray. Alli then came close to finding the net in the 62nd minute with an elegantly curled strike shortly before Christian Eriksen put Heaton to the test with a driven shot aimed for the bottom corner. Tottenham celebrate Danny Rose's winner After continued Tottenham pressure and some effective defending by Michael Keane and Ben Mee, Spurs took the lead. A powerful run from substitute Moussa Sissoko opened up the Burnley defence before teeing up Rose to smash in his second goal in 12 Premier League appearances. Tottenham continued to press Burnley to get a third goal, including near misses from Kane and Son Heung-Min, and were able to hold on for back-to-back Premier League wins as Burnley's away day troubles continue.

Palace then had another sighting of goal as Kelly's cross picked out James McArthur but the midfielder's header flew wide. Costa struck his 13th goal of the season for Chelsea It proved to be costly as Chelsea took the lead just before the break as Costa rose above Scott Dann to head the ball back across Hennessey and into the back of the net.

Middlesbrough's Marten de Roon side-foots home the home side's third goal The free-flowing move started with Valdes at the back and after a number of passes, the ball was worked to Ramirez, lurking towards the right of the area, and the Uruguay playmaker then curled in an inch-perfect cross for De Roon to convert from just six yards out. It was the first time that Middlesbrough had scored three times in the Premier League since April 2009 against Hull City, while the visitors have now shipped a worrying 37 top-flight goals this season, including 11 in their last three away games.

"report": "Stoke 2-2 Leicester Stoke 2-2 Leicester Daniel Amartey scored an 88th-minute equaliser as 10-man Leicester came from two goals down to snatch a dramatic 2-2 draw at Stoke. The reigning champions' miserable away form looked set to continue at the bet365 Stadium when the Potters capitalised on Jamie Vardy's 28th-minute dismissal to lead 2-0 at the break, thanks to goals from Bojan Krkic and Joe Allen. But the Foxes produced a stirring second-half comeback to earn a share of the spoils, substitute Leonardo Ulloa scoring the first before Amartey's first Leicester goal sealed the turnaround. With referee Craig Pawson's first-half performance prompting such frustration in the Foxes' ranks, the typically placid Claudio Ranieri had to be dragged away from the referee by Kasper Schmeichel at the interval, yet when the full-time whistle went, the Italian was back fist pumping in front of the travelling support. Leicester's second away point of the season leaves them in 15th in the Premier League, Stoke climb a place to 11th. Claudio Ranieri hopes Leicester’s comeback against Stoke can be the turning point of their season Claudio Ranieri hopes Leicester’s comeback against Stoke can be the turning point of their season Prior to Vardy's dismissal, an entertaining, open game had been staged, with the returning Schmeichel saving brilliantly with his foot from Jon Walters' six-yard effort and Stoke keeper Lee Grant making three stops at the other end. With Andy King's crucial block also preventing Bojan from opening the scoring, it looked like the first goal would prove pivotal. As it was, it was Vardy's 28th-minute red card that set the tone. The England striker was chasing back to make a tackle alongside Glen Johnson and, with the full-back leaning into him, Vardy left the ground to lunge into a challenge on Diouf, though he had returned to the turf by the time he slid in. Referee Pawson, who had been criticised for his decision only to book Manchester United defender Marcos Rojo for his two-footed tackle on Wilfried Zaha on Wednesday, immediately showed a red card. The visitors felt hard done by and their frustration only grew when Pawson awarded a penalty as Bojan's cross struck Simpson's arm, which was in an unnatural position bent above his head. The protests fell on deaf ears as Bojan, who missed the last penalty he took here against Bournemouth, stepped up and sent Schmeichel the wrong way. Stoke manager Mark Hughes was frustrated that his team didn’t hold onto a 2-0 lead after 10-man Leicester fought back to claim a draw Stoke manager Mark Hughes was frustrated that his team didn’t hold onto a 2-0 lead after 10-man Leicester fought back to claim a draw Having fallen behind, the visitors then completely unravelled, with Simpson's caution in that incident the first of five in quick succession. King was cautioned for a rash challenge, Islam Slimani and Christian Fuchs were both booked for dissent and Marc Albrighton's name was taken for a foul on Glen Johnson on the edge of the box. From that free-kick, Johnson went short to Giannelli Imbula, whose shot hit the post and came back off Schmeichel's back, with Allen all alone to finish into the unguarded net to make it 2-0 before the break. Claudio Ranieri expressed his frustration to the officials at half-time of Leicester's game with Stoke Claudio Ranieri expressed his frustration to the officials at half-time of Leicester's game with Stoke Such was Leicester's anger at Pawson's performance, the normally mild-mannered Ranieri had to be dragged away from the official by Schmeichel and he was still venting his fury near the tunnel, where the visiting support also ranted in the referee's direction. Any chance of Pawson not taking centre stage upon the resumption was dashed as he delayed his return to the pitch and then booked Huth within three second-half minutes, ensuring the German, Fuchs and Vardy will all be suspended on Boxing Day against Everton. However, with everything seeming to go against them, Leicester fought back and reduced the deficit 16 minutes from time through substitute Ulloa, whose header from Demarai Gray's cross went over the line before Ryan Shawcross could hook clear.

The winner came just four minutes after the break, with Van Aanholt meeting Jermain Defoe's cross to score his third goal of the season. With Hull and Swansea both losing, victory for Sunderland means they will not be bottom at Christmas, and they now sit just one point off safety in 18th.

Van Aanholt then struck what was ultimately the winner just four minutes after the break. Adnan Januzaj started the move brilliantly, skipping beyond a challenge before picking out Defoe out wide, and his low cross was met by Van Aanholt, whose swivel and shot headed in off the inside of the post after Christian Kabasele slid in to block an initial attempt.

Davies holds off West Ham's Dimitri Payet Robertson then cleared off the line from Andre Ayew's header from Payet's corner, while David Marshall saved well from Antonio's left-footed shot from an angle. Edimilson Fernandes cleared off the line at the other end from Maguire's header, before the breakthrough came in the 76th minute. Noble celebrates the winning goal at London Stadium After the ball bounced around the Hull area, Huddlestone dragged down Antonio, deemed by Lee Mason to be a foul, leaving Noble to slot the ball home for the winner. Maguire could have equalised for Hull late on, but Randolph kept out the defender's effort from an angle when squaring for team-mates looked the better option.

The striker - who has now scored seven goals in his last six league appearances - netted at the start of each half, nodding home in the fifth minute before scoring his second 11 minutes into the second period. Wayne Rooney was denied the chance to equalise Sir Bobby Charlton's United record scoring tally by the crossbar in the first half, with West Brom offering little in terms of a reply. United remain sixth but have now pulled away from the chasing pack - with the Baggies leading the charge in seventh - and are now level on 30 points with fifth-placed Tottenham. Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored twice at The Hawthorns on Saturday evening The visitors did not waste their time in getting on the scoresheet, striking with less than five minutes on the clock. Jesse Lingard showed his pace on the wing, getting away down the right flank to send a pin-point cross into the box which found the head of Ibrahimovic to nod home. Craig Dawson cleared another dangerous right-wing cross from the path of Wayne Rooney three minutes later, before West Brom went close at the other end but no one was at the back post to meet a darting Chris Brunt corner. Claudio Yacob is fouled by Ander Herrera during the first half Rooney remains one goal away from Charlton's club record 249 goals, but went close to nabbing the equalising goal in the 24th minute. Paul Pogba slid in Lingard on the left-hand side who then found Rooney at the top of the box but the United captain's fierce half-volley was pushed onto the crossbar by Ben Foster. There was controversy not long after, as Ibrahimovic and Craig Dawson rose together for a high challenge with the United striker appearing to use his shoulder to send the defender tumbling to the ground. There were shouts from the crowd for a red card, but referee Anthony Taylor only produced a yellow. Swedish striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic heads Man Utd into the lead against West Brom West Brom's best effort of the half came just after the half an hour mark as Matt Phillips surged down the left flank, crossing in for the head of Rondon - who netted a hat-trick of headers in midweek - but he could not get his effort on target and it flashed wide. United went close again in the final minute of the half, as a miss hit volley from Matteo Darmian found its way into the path of Lingard who was unmarked in the area - but his own shot fired well wide of the post as the visitors took their lead into the break. Zlatan Ibrahimovic celebrates scoring his side's first goal It took just 11 minutes in the second period for United to add their second, with Ibrahimovic again finding the net. Rooney found the Swedish striker on the right side of the box who then wriggled his way through a number of white shirts before going for goal, with the ball taking a deflection off Dawson on the way past Foster. Tempers flared in the 66th minute as Marcos Rojo and Salomon Rondon clashed and West Brom were arguably lucky to keep their striker on the pitch. The two were involved in a challenge on the right of the United box, with the defender expressing his anger at the incident with the Baggies man as they had a heated exchange, leading to Rondon lightly slapping Rojo. Zlatan Ibrahimovic scores his and United's second goal at The Hawthorns Players surrounded the two and referee Anthony Taylor in the aftermath, but each received a yellow card for the incident. There was little in terms of chances for the remainder of the half, although substitute Marcus Rashford nearly added a third late on but his thunderous shot from the middle of the box was deflected wide by Gareth McAuley as United comfortably saw out the victory.

Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp says his side were difficult to play against but the score was flattering Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp says his side were difficult to play against but the score was flattering Boro reacted well, Viktor Fischer forcing Mignolet into a good one-handed save from an angle, before Adam Forshaw saw a shot from just inside the area blocked well by Dejan Lovren after fine work from Adama Traore on the right.

After Lallana was released down the right flank, his centre found Origi on the gallop for the Belgian to fire it into the bottom corner, his fifth goal in five games. Adam Lallana heads in the opening goal of the game Origi turned provider with 22 minutes remaining, cutting the ball back to Lallana 12 yards out, and the midfielder made no mistake with a simple finish into the top corner as Boro struggled to cover.

Premier League victory with a 1-0 win over Sunderland on Wednesday to send them six points clear at the top of the table. Cesc Fabregas' first league goal of the season put the Blues in front (40) at the Stadium of Light and they had chances to make the game safe through Diego Costa, N'Golo Kante and Willian. But they were nearly punished in stoppage time when Thibaut Courtois denied Patrick van Aanholt with a stunning stop, preserving his clean sheet and extending Chelsea's winning run. Chelsea's Cesc Fabregas scores his side's goal at Sunderland Arsenal's defeat to Everton on Tuesday opened the door for Antonio Conte's side and they took full advantage, moving six points clear of second place and guaranteeing top spot over Christmas.

Chelsea head coach Antonio Conte says he is delighted with his side's 10th consecutive league win Chelsea head coach Antonio Conte says he is delighted with his side's 10th consecutive league win Sunderland remain bottom, with Watford set to visit the Stadium of Light next on Saturday. Chelsea, without the injured Eden Hazard, struggled to make inroads in the early stages and Sunderland had the first chance when Adnan Januzaj sliced over.

Willian went close to doubling their lead on the stroke of half-time, but his free-kick landed on the roof of Pickford's net. Januzaj, who was bright on the flanks for the home side, forced Courtois into a smart stop shortly after the interval but Chelsea swiftly regained control. Willian escapes the attention of Billy Jones They should have been out of sight as Willian's deflected strike hit the crossbar and Pickford denied Costa and Kante, while Victor Moses and Fabregas flashed efforts wide. But they failed to put Sunderland away and the relegation battlers had two late chances to snatch a point. Jason Denayer headed straight at Courtois from van Aanholt's cross, before the Dutch defender forced the save of the match from Chelsea's Belgian goalkeeper.

"report": "West Ham 1-0 Burnley highlights West Ham 1-0 Burnley highlights Mark Noble's first-half strike was enough for West Ham to secure a vital 1-0 victory over Burnley at the London Stadium on Wednesday night. After impressing in the weekend draw at Liverpool, the pressure was on the Hammers' players to beat a Burnley side who don't travel well, making for a tense night in the East End. Noble settled some of those nerves when he scored from the rebound, after his own penalty had been saved, in first-half stoppage time. Noble reacted fastest to saved penalty The second half saw the visitors press for an equaliser, adding to the anxious feeling around the stadium, with Sam Vokes guilty of missing Burnley's best opening from point-blank range. The Hammers held on for only their third home win of the season, one that seems them climb to 16th in the league table. Burnley remain in 13th. Andy Carroll was restored to the starting XI by Slaven Bilic, but cut an isolated figure as he was starved of any decent service in the opening exchanges. Dean Marney and Pedro Obiang battle to win a header at the London Stadium The hosts had strong shouts for a penalty waved away by referee Bobby Madley in the 25th minute, as Michael Keane appeared to handle. Referee Madley deemed it to be unintentional. It wasn't until the 33rd minute that Tom Heaton was forced into making a save in the Burnley goal, as he got down well to smother a rasping effort from Michail Antonio. Three minutes later, Pedro Obiang went even closer, as his fierce effort fizzed just past the post with Heaton beaten. West Ham boss Slaven Bilic says his side gave a really good performance but they should have done better in the second half West Ham boss Slaven Bilic says his side gave a really good performance but they should have done better in the second half Then, as the half drew to a close, the hosts got that crucial breakthrough. Firstly, Noble saw his superb curler from outside the box cannon back of the upright, before he got another chance to break the deadlock from the spot, after Winston Reid was bundled over in the box. The Hammers skipper stepped up and saw his penalty saved by Heaton, but reacted fastest to smash home the rebound. After the break, Burnley threw everything at the Hammers, but couldn't find a way through. Vokes had three chances in quick succession, the final of those the worst miss of the night. Burnley manager Sean Dyche says that poor officiating was to blame Burnley manager Sean Dyche says that poor officiating was to blame It all started from a brilliant run from Scott Arfield which carried him into the box, Darren Randolph blocked his goalbound effort, the loose ball bounced up, Vokes charged in, but headed over with the goal gaping. Randolph was again called into action in the Hammers goal, this time having to get a strong hand to Arfield's free-kick in the 71st minute. Burnley continued to throw everything at the hosts, but they couldn't find only a second away goal of the season. Next up for the Hammers is Hull on Saturday - another match the home faithful will expect three points from.

The Swede clinically converted past Wayne Hennessey in the closing stages at Selhurst Park after fine work from Paul Pogba, who hit a controversial opener in first-half stoppage time. On a night littered with contentious decisions, Palace were aggrieved Marcos Rojo was not shown a red card for a two-footed tackle on former United winger Wilfried Zaha in the first period. But the hosts sought their own retribution after the break when James McArthur slotted a classy equaliser on 66 minutes. However, it was Ibrahimovic who had the final word as United remained in the hunt for the top four positions by claiming back-to-back league wins for the first time since August. Wayne Rooney was handed his first Premier League start since early November as Jose Mourinho made four changes to the United side which beat Tottenham. Zlatan Ibrahimovic celebrates putting Manchester United 2-1 up late in the game Eric Bailly, Daley Blind and Juan Mata also got the nod, while Alan Pardew recalled Mathieu Flamini, Yohan Cabaye and Chung-Yong Lee to the Crystal Palace starting line-up. Mourinho has reiterated United have been playing well in spite of recent disappointing performances and their assured start at Selhurst vindicated their manager's assertion. It was a start which began with a scare though, as Bailly collapsed off the ball clutching his left knee before gingerly returning to action. United went on to take full control of the game but had to wait 37 minutes for a shot on target as Hennessey sprung to his left to deny a Rooney volley. Then came the controversy as Rojo, less than two weeks after he avoided red for a robust lunge on Everton's Idrissa Gueye, replicated a poor challenge on Zaha and received only a yellow. There was more cause for Palace to feel aggrieved as United took the lead before the break. The officials failed to spot Ibrahimovic use his arm to deflect a United free-kick into the path of Pogba, who converted from an offside position. Half-time substitute Joe Ledley almost had the immediate impact for Palace, whistling a shot wide seconds after coming on. And the home side continued to pose a threat as McArthur called David de Gea into a sublime save on 62 minutes. And, after gathering Damien Delaney's stunning back-heel, McArthur finally broke the Spaniard's resolve, slotting past him at his near post. United almost restored their lead immediately, but Hennessey ensured Rooney's wait to surpass Sir Bobby Charlton's goalscoring record continued with a fine save on 68 minutes. James McArthur equalises for Crystal Palace Referee Pawson then chose not to penalise Ledley for blocking a Rojo header for handball, before Mata had a goal wrongfully denied for offside as frustration began to set in for United. However, with the game destined for a stalemate, Pogba and Ibrahimovic took matters into their own hands, combining for the winner.. Pogba rolled Cabaye in midfield before clipping Ibrahimovic behind the Palace defence, where the Swede slotted past Hennessey from the most acute of angles to send the travelling band of United fans into raptures.

City had won just four of their previous 15 games in all competitions, but goals from Pablo Zabaleta and David Silva either side of half-time ensured a relatively comfortable three points on Wednesday night. There was a real blow for City, however, who could be without Ilkay Gundogan for several months after he was forced off in the first half with suspected knee ligament damage. Despite that, City stay fourth in the Premier League, staving off the threat of Tottenham and Manchester United behind them, but they also remain seven points off Chelsea at the top of the table. It was a disappointing night for Watford and Walter Mazzarri, meanwhile, who failed to build on their win over Everton at the weekend and drop out of the top half into 11th. Guardiola made five changes in response to his team's 4-2 defeat at Leicester on Saturday, but it was two of the men who started at the King Power Stadium that combined for the opener. Kevin De Bruyne had been City's most threatening player in the first half, and he got down the left after 33 minutes before picking out Zabaleta at the far post. It had been more than two years since the right-back had found the net for City, but he showed no rustiness in front of goal, slotting home with his first touch. Odion Ighalo of Watford and Yaya Toure of Manchester City compete for the ball Aside from the goal there was little action in a first half dominated by City. But there was a blow to both sides as Watford lost Roberto Pereyra - making his return from suspension - to injury just before City struck, while the home side then lost Gundogan late in the half. City continued to dominate in the second half but they created very few chances as Watford defended resiliently. Raheem Sterling was looking lively down the right, and he came closest to a second after 57 minutes when he cut inside and drove to the edge of the area before seeing his shot clip the top of the bar and go over. Watford finally started to grow into the game as they pushed for an equaliser, and finally created a few opportunities late on. Pep Guardiola praises Zabaleta after his opener Pep Guardiola praises Zabaleta after his opener After 76 minutes Etienne Capoue forced a fine save out of Claudio Bravo with a low drive after a free-kick had fallen to him at the far post, then Odion Ighalo missed a great opportunity five minutes later, steering the ball over the bar after being picked out perfectly in the box by Nordin Amrabat. And the Hornets would come to rue that missed opportunity four minutes from time. Capitalising on some space in behind, Silva and Sterling countered well into the box, exchanging passes before the Spaniard slotted home calmly from close range to kill the game off.

0-0 Southampton Stoke 0-0 Southampton Southampton missed out on the chance to make it two wins from two in the Premier League after being held to a frustrating 0-0 draw at Stoke on Wednesday night. The Potters were forced to play most of the match with 10 men after Marko Arnautovic was sent off by referee Anthony Taylor for a late challenge on Sofiane Boufal midway through the first half. However, without injured striker Charlie Austin, Claude Puel's side lacked a clinical edge up front and rarely threatened Lee Grant's goal, despite dominating possession.

Stoke’s Mark Hughes thinks referee Anthony Taylor should have shown common sense after he sent off Marko Arnautovic Stoke’s Mark Hughes thinks referee Anthony Taylor should have shown common sense after he sent off Marko Arnautovic Referee Taylor consulted his linesman before showing the red card and replays showed it was the correct decision, despite protests from Potters boss Mark Hughes. Southampton began to dominate possession but were guilty of wasting a number of chances with their poor final delivery. The Saints were unable to make the most of their man advantage The half-time interval did little to change the match and Southampton were mostly limited to long-range shots - the best coming from Ryan Bertrand, who stung the palms of Grant with a rasping drive from 30 yards out. Boufal had a late chance to win it for the visitors when he was played through on goal but instead he elected to pass to Jay Rodriguez, who failed to convert the chance.

he inspired Tottenham to a comfortable 3-0 win over Hull in the Premier League. The White Hart Lane side dictated play for large spells against Mike Phelan's team and went ahead through the Dane early in the first half. While they took time to build on their slender lead, Tottenham eventually went further in front through Eriksen after the break before Victor Wanyama poked in a third. With Liverpool winning at Middlesbrough, the Londoners are still outside the top four - but they do have a better points total than at this stage last season after making it four home wins in a row. Tottenham's overall form hasn't been great lately and they went into this match having won just three of their last 13 games across the Premier League, the EFL Cup and the Champions League. Christian Eriksen shows his appreciation to Tottenham's fans after they beat Hull at White Hart Lane At White Hart Lane, however, they had won five of their last seven games and were heavy favourites to come out on top against a Hull side which had won only one away Premier League fixture. The hosts, however, began brighter and Moussa Sissoko looked sharp on his recall to the side but saw his shot saved by David Marshall with comfort. Tom Huddlestone then had to be alert to prevent Dele Alli from testing the Scotland goalkeeper after a teasing ball from the right by Eriksen. Eriksen passes high into the net for the first of his two goals against Hull Mauricio Pochettino's men were starting to build rhythm and after 14 minutes they took a merited lead through a simple yet well executed move. Jan Vertonghen played a delicately flighted ball down the left which Danny Rose scurried away to pick up and he cut into the penalty area. After getting past Ahmed Elmohamady, the England international's neat flick teed up Eriksen and he didn't have to break his stride as he passed high into the net to give Tottenham an advantage. Kyle Walker bursts into the penalty area to set up Tottenham's second goal for Eriksen The trouble was they struggled to add to it, despite having plenty of possession. Alli's low shot was tame and easily held while Eriksen's second attempt, after a free kick was blocked, went wide. It took time for Hull to muster a response but they finally did, with Jake Livermore twice testing Hugo Lloris. Mauricio Pochettino says there is no doubt Eric Dier will stay at Tottenham following their 3-0 win Mauricio Pochettino says there is no doubt Eric Dier will stay at Tottenham following their 3-0 win The second occasion saw the Frenchman tip wide for a corner and when Robert Snodgrass sent it in, Elmohamady curled goalwards but a weak effort was held. Tottenham finished the half with more pressure but still could not make it count. Harry Kane's connection with a Sissoko cutback was weak before the Frenchman's own drive sailed high over the upright. Eriksen scores his side's second goal to give them breathing space Eriksen's penalty claims were rightly waved away after Harry Maguire's unintentional handball and Vertonghen's unlikely run into the box saw his shot blocked before he fouled Michael Dawson. Hull were lively after the restart and Livermore had a third go at goal but Lloris denied him brilliantly once more as he thrust his left foot out to divert wide. That proved to be a key moment as moments later Tottenham finally got the second goal they needed to pull away from their opponents. Victor Wanyama (right) got Tottenham's third and clinching goal Again it was Eriksen who scored but he benefitted from good work from his team-mates, with Eric Dier starting things off. He freed Kyle Walker and the full-back outmuscled Andy Robertson to play across the face of goal to the waiting Eriksen at the back post. Hull manager Mike Phelan was disappointed after his side failed to score Hull manager Mike Phelan was disappointed after his side failed to score It was the post which stopped the Denmark international from claiming a hat-trick, with his bending free kick coming off the upright 10 minutes later. Wanyama profited instead, getting just ahead of Sissoko to poke in his second goal since a summer move from Southampton. Wanyama celebrates scoring Tottenham's final goal against Hull Eriksen had one final try at completing his treble but while it wasn't to be his night on that front, he was a driving force behind a very routine success.

Rondon's hat-trick of headers sent West Brom seventh in the Premier League as a 3-1 defeat at The Hawthorns kept Swansea in the bottom three. Rondon's forehead did the damage in the space of 13 second-half minutes to make it three home wins on the spin ahead of Manchester United's visit at the weekend. Swansea were tidy enough with the game goalless but failed to lay a meaningful glove on their hosts until Wayne Routledge's late reply (78), and Bob Bradley will be concerned at the flimsiness of a defence which is shipping away goals at a rate of three a game under his management. Rondon headed a hat-trick against Swansea in 13 minutes The American might look to the opposition dugout for an example of what can be built on the foundation of a firm rearguard, and in general Tony Pulis' side coped admirably with the loss of two mainstays - the suspended Craig Dawson and injured Jonny Evans. Allan Nyom, in particular, caught the eye as he was switched to right-back and dealt doggedly with Jefferson Montero's fleet of foot, even finding time to kick-start the best move of the first half. Rondon's three goals were all headers, the first of them coming five minutes after the break A 40-yard burst turned the tables on Montero and allowed Nacer Chadli - starting for the first time since October - to slot Rondon in goal. The Venezuelan was in one-on-one but lost the duel as Lukasz Fabianski's right leg kept him out. That was as good as it got for either side during an opening 45 minutes punctuated by Pulis' audible exhortations - put politely - from the technical area. If a half-time rollicking followed it would scarcely have come as a surprise to his players. Tony Pulis says nobody will get carried away despite moving to seventh in the Premier League Tony Pulis says nobody will get carried away despite moving to seventh in the Premier League Whatever the manager said at the break worked, and a nibble at Chadli's ankles gave Matt Phillips the chance to swing a free-kick to the six-yard line, where Rondon escaped Alfie Mawson's attention to head past Fabianski (50). An identikit pair of goals followed as Chris Brunt, starting at left-back on his 32nd birthday, twice made the most of space out wide to tee up Rondon's second and third. Nacer Chadli was back in the West Brom side for the first time since October Chadli's sidle from the left almost produced a fourth before a slew of substitutions seemed to affect Albion's concentration, Routledge following up to score after Ben Foster blocked Borja Baston's shot. Foster had been a spectator until then but marked his 150th Premier League appearance for the club with a fine stop that spared Gareth McAuley the added-time indignity of an own goal.

Leicester Bournemouth 1-0 Leicester Leicester City's dismal Premier League title defence continued with a limp 1-0 defeat against Bournemouth at the Vitality Stadium on Tuesday night. Marc Pugh marked his first Premier League start of the season with the decisive goal, emphatically volleying the Cherries ahead after 34 minutes after Ron-Robert Zieler had denied Benik Afobe. The reigning champions looked a shadow of the side which ruthlessly dispatched Manchester City 4-2 in their last league outing but came close to snatching a point at the death, only for Artur Boruc to thwart Leonardo Ulloa from point-blank range. The result moved Bournemouth up to eighth the table. Leicester, meanwhile, remain four points clear of the relegation zone in 14th. Pugh was drafted into the Bournemouth line-up alongside Jack Wilshere and Joshua King as Eddie Howe made three changes from Saturday's defeat at Burnley. The Cherries nearly made the perfect start as Adam Smith came within inches of heading Charlie Daniels' driven cross home inside four minutes. Marc Pugh celebrates his first-half goal for Bournemouth, which proved to be the winner Having combined brilliantly to dismantle City last time out, Riyad Mahrez and Jamie Vardy almost repeated the feat in the seventh minute but, having been played through on goal, the England striker's heavy touch allowed Steve Cook to block his goal-bound effort. A period of Bournemouth dominance followed though as Leicester struggled to retain possession in opposition territory. Wilshere called Zieler into action with a low drive from 18 yards before the hosts saw referee Paul Tierney ignore claims for a penalty after 29 minutes after Luis Hernandez appeared to haul Nathan Ake to ground. Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe claimed his side defended heroically in the 1-0 win over Leicester Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe claimed his side defended heroically in the 1-0 win over Leicester Despite being on the back foot, Leicester continued to create the better chances as Robert Huth saw a fierce drive blocked en route to goal on 33 minutes. However, that simply spurned the hosts on and they took a deserved lead on the counter. Pugh was perfectly placed to react quickest to the loose ball after Zieler had saved from Benik Afobe, with the midfielder emphatically thundering home his first goal since April. The goal was quickly followed by an encouraging feat for Wilshere, who surpassed 887 minutes of Premier League action for Bournemouth - more than he had managed in his previous two seasons at Arsenal. Jamie Vardy takes a shot on goal under pressure from Steve Cook Leicester started the second half well but Huth was again unable to grab a foothold for the champions, swiping at thin air at a corner five minutes after the restart. Adam Smith then whistled a curling effort over fractionally over the Leicester goal as the Cherries pushed for a second. Huth was presented with another chance to draw Leicester level on 75 minutes but the German glanced a header agonisingly wide. Leicester manager Claudio Ranieri believes his side deserved more out of the game against Bournemouth due to the number of chances they created Leicester manager Claudio Ranieri believes his side deserved more out of the game against Bournemouth due to the number of chances they created The Foxes continued to come forward with substitute Shinji Okazaki dragging a shot wide on 76 minutes before Cook's last-ditch block thwarted the Japan international four minutes from time. But the drama wasn't to end there as, in the final minute of normal time, Boruc blocked Ulloa's fiercely-struck effort to secure the Bournemouth victory, extending Leicester's wait for an away win to eight games.

Ashley Williams' 86th-minute header completed the comeback for the hosts after Seamus Coleman (44) had cancelled out Alexis Sanchez's deflected free-kick (20). Phil Jagielka was sent off in the closing stages for a second yellow card - ruling him out of the Merseyside derby on Monday Night Football - before Arsenal twice saw efforts cleared off the line in stoppage time, denying the visitors a dramatic equaliser. Victory for Arsenal would have sent them above league leaders Chelsea, who travel to Sunderland on Wednesday, but defeat means they remain second, while Everton climb to seventh thanks to their first win in six league matches. Seamus Coleman equalised for Everton in the first half Ronald Koeman made four changes from the defeat to Watford, recalling Ross Barkley to the starting lineup, but the hosts were sluggish in the early stages and fell behind on 20 minutes. Jagielka fouled Francis Coquelin on the edge of the box, and Sanchez's set-piece ricocheted off the unfortunate Williams and past Maarten Stekelenburg. With Enner Valencia and Aaron Lennon a growing influence down Everton's flanks, Koeman's side improved as the half wore on and grabbed their equaliser just before the break through Coleman. The Ireland international was left unmarked by a static Arsenal defence and glanced home Leighton Baines' cross from close range. Alexis Sanchez opened the scoring for Arsenal Mesut Ozil squandered a golden opportunity to put his side back in front shortly after half-time, firing over from Sanchez's cut-back. Olivier Giroud and Alex Iwobi were introduced for Arsenal while Koeman brought on Kevin Mirallas and teenager Dominic Calvert-Lewin for his Premier League debut as both sides went in search of a winner. Arsenal missed the chance to overtake Chelsea at the top of the Premier League It came four minutes from time as Williams rose highest from a Barkley corner to head home, setting the stage for a frantic finale. Jagielka, who had been booked when conceding the free-kick which led to Arsenal's opener, was dismissed by referee Mark Clattenburg for pulling down substitute Lucas Perez. And with goalkeeper Petr Cech forward for the resulting free-kick, the Gunners went close to snatching a last-gasp equaliser. Everton failed to clear their lines and with Stekelenburg out of position, Nacho Monreal saw an initial effort blocked before Baines denied Iwobi's goal-bound strike with a stunning block on the line. Arsenal appealed for a spot-kick as Sanchez then went to ground under the challenge of Mirallas, but the hosts played on leaving Cech stranded, only for Lukaku and Barkley to hesitate with the goal gaping. It did not matter in the end as Everton held on for the win, condemning Arsenal to their first league defeat on a Tuesday since 2006, with a trip to face Man City up next for Wenger's side, live on Sky Sports.

With the game heading towards a frustrating stalemate, Diego Costa punished a Gareth McAuley error on 76 minutes as the Blues restored their three-point lead over Arsenal at the top of the table. Costa's 12th goal of the season extended Chelsea's winning streak to nine top-flight games as Antonio Conte's men further underlined their status as title favourites. It will have a been a difficult result for West Brom to swallow who, having limited Chelsea to a single shot on target before Costa's goal, slipped to a first defeat in five to leave them eighth in the Premier League. Antonio Conte made one change from last weekend's victory at Manchester City, replacing Cesc Fabregas with Nemanja Matic, while Tony Pulis named an unchanged side for the fifth game running. From the offset it was clear the onus was on the Premier League's in-form team to take the game to the Baggies, with the visitors setting Chelsea the task of breaking their defensive unit down. Diego Costa scores for Chelsea It was a task the hosts struggled to contend with as West Brom created the first clear opening, Chris Brunt whistling a fierce drive wide on 19 minutes. Salomon Rondon then went close on 26 minutes, picking David Luiz's pocket on the left before flashing a low effort across the face of goal. That yielded an immediate response from Chelsea as Pedro deflected N'Golo Kante's wide effort inches wide of Ben Foster's left-hand post. Chelsea's Eden Hazard takes on Chris Brunt Having evaded the head of Costa, Eden Hazard's teasing cross on 38 minutes came close to breaking the deadlock as Chelsea tried to finish their hand strongly. But West Brom were able to keep the hosts at arm's length, Luiz's swerving free-kick the closest they came to scoring, but Foster was a match to the effort. A series of fouls and booking disrupted the flow of the game in the second half, playing right into the hands of Albion whose game plan thrived in such a climate. Salomon Rondon of West Bromwich Albion controls the ball under pressure of Gary Cahill of Chelsea Again it was down to Luiz to threaten the Baggies goal, but he failed to hit the target on 61 minutes. A frustrating afternoon could have taken a turn for the worse for Chelsea on 67 minutes, but Gary Cahill's instinctive interception stopped Darren Fletcher from firing West Brom ahead. Then came the game's defining moment as Costa harassed McAuley 14 minutes from time, stole possession on the right, carried it into the Albion area and rifled a clinical shot past Foster. Chelsea's Diego Costa celebrates It was a cruel blow to West Brom after such an assured defensive display, although that will be of little concern to Chelsea as Costa's sheer tenacity cemented their title charge.

The Armenian continued his impressive recent form and fired the hosts into the lead at Old Trafford just before the half-hour mark, with United looking potent in attack throughout the match. There was an unfortunate end to Mkhitaryan's afternoon as he was stretchered off with five minutes of the game to play after picking up an ankle injury, but his goal saw United pick up their first home league win since September 24. Jose Mourinho's side have closed the gap to three points on Tottenham, who looked off the pace for much of the 90 minutes and remain in fifth on 27 points. The hosts could have got off to the perfect start with a goal inside the opening two minutes. Mkhitaryan powered through the middle of the park before sliding in Zlatan Ibrahimovic on the right. Mkhitaryan scores the opening goal for United The Swedish striker then found Paul Pogba in the middle of the box and he went for goal, but Hugo Lloris was down to make a good stop. Tottenham had a few half chances in the opening exchanges. Heung-Min Son curled just wide of the post after a decent break from the visitors. Then a great cross-field ball from Toby Alderweireld nearly saw Dele Alli connect at the back post but some good defending from Phil Jones sent the ball wide. Harry Kane and Michael Carrick battle for the ball at Old Trafford The north London side continued to see the better of possession - with David de Gea pushing away a great free-kick from Christian Eriksen in the 19th minute - but United looked the more dangerous in attack and nearly broke the deadlock in the 24th minute. A sublime ball over from Michael Carrick found Ander Herrera in the box, who played the ball back to Mkhitaryan to fire towards goal, but a great block from Jan Vertonghen resulted in a corner. Mkhitaryan was taken off in the 85th minute after picking up an ankle injury Danny Rose was then on hand to block a Jones header, before Herrera's thunderbolt effort from 20 yards was collected by Lloris. But the hosts found the breakthrough five minutes later as Mkhitaryan deservedly got his goal. It was a sloppy pass from Kane that saw Herrera slide the ball through two Spurs defenders to set off the Armenian international, and he rocketed the ball into the back of the net for his first Premier League goal. Zlatan Ibrahimovic reacts following a challenge on Kyle Walker United very nearly had a second six minutes later as a great cross from Antonio Valencia on the right just evaded the over-head kick of Pogba, before a pinpoint shot from Ibrahimovic was well saved by Lloris. A minute later, Son went for glory at the other end - but De Gea produced a fingertip stop to push it over the crossbar. It was a much better start to the second half from Tottenham, who came close to getting themselves level in the 56th minute as Eriksen whipped in a free-kick to find an unmarked Victor Wanyama at the back post, but he skewed his header into the floor and it went agonisingly wide. Henrikh Mkhitaryan celebrates his opener at Old Trafford Pogba was twice denied the chance to grab a goal in quick succession as the game entered into the final half an hour. He smashed a free-kick against the crossbar in the 64th minute before Mkhitaryan found the Frenchman at the top of the box two minutes later after another good break from United, but his effort was palmed away by Lloris. Mkhitaryan's game came to a abrupt end in the 85th minute as he was stretchered off after clashing with Danny Rose and injuring his ankle, but received a standing ovation from the home crowd as he made his way down the tunnel. Henrikh Mkhitaryan is stretchered off towards the end of the game Both sides had penalty shouts dismissed in the six minutes of added time as Rose went down in the box after a challenge with Jones before Ibrahimovic was fouled at the other end. But United managed to see the game out to end a run of three successive 1-1 draws.

fired Southampton to a 1-0 victory over Middlesbrough with his first Premier League goal for the club. The Morocco international's stunning effort from the edge of the area was enough to separate the sides in a stop-start affair at St Mary's. Jay Rodriguez should have doubled Saints' advantage in stoppage time, but the hosts were good value for their victory as they moved back into the top half of the table. Boro lacked a cutting edge in the second half, but could have broken the deadlock in the first period after Viktor Fischer rounded the keeper - but his effort struck the post from a narrow angle. The result leaves Boro down in 16th, while Southampton are up to tenth, level on points with West Brom and Everton. Southampton and Boro were meeting in Premier League for the first time since March 2005, while the Saints were looking for a first top-flight home win over their opponents since 1996. Dusan Tadic of Southampton and Middlesbrough's Fabio battle for possession And in a scrappy first half it was Middlesbrough who looked more likely to break the deadlock, with Fraser Forster saving Jordan Rhodes' effort from point-blank range after just four minutes. Southampton's best chance came midway through the half as Rodriguez latched onto a cross and forced Victor Valdes to get down and make a smart save. A pinpoint ball from Dusan Tadic was then met by James Ward-Prowse but the midfielder failed to direct his header on goal. Moments later, a sloppy back-pass from Ward-Prowse played Fischer through on goal for Boro, but the Dane hit the post after rounding Forster and shooting from a narrow angle. Aitor Karanka's side remain in 16th - three points clear of the drop-zone The ball then fell to Cristhian Stuani six yards out, but his first effort was blocked before his second flew over after kicking the ball against his own standing leg. Eight minutes into the second half, Boufal brought the game to life with a moment of magic. The 23-year-old, who joined from Lille for £16m in August, struck an effort with his left foot that curled away from Valdes and flew into the top corner. Boro's response was poor and Aitor Karanka failed to make a change until the 81st minute despite Southampton switching to a more defensive-minded approach when Steven Davis replaced goalscorer Boufal. Southampton's Sofiane Boufal celebrates with Claude Puel - the Moroccan international joined for £16m from Lille in the summer Adama Traore's introduction did little to help Boro, and it was Southampton who really should have put the game to bed in the dying minutes. And while Rodriguez ended up sliding into the net, the ball didn't follow suit in what will go down as a bad miss after the striker failed to direct his effort on goal from two yards out from Nathan Redmond's cross.

Liverpool took the lead early on through Adam Lallana's neat strike, but Dimitri Payet's 25-yard free-kick and Michail Antonio's finish had West Ham going into the break 2-1 up via some questionable goalkeeping from Loris Karius on both occasions. Divock Origi capitalised on Darren Randolph dropping a Sadio Mane cross to finish from close range just after the break, but despite dominating the second half in possession, Liverpool could not grab a winner. The result means third-place Liverpool are six points behind leaders Chelsea and three behind second-place Arsenal. West Ham are 17th, a point above the drop zone. Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp jokes with his West Ham counterpart Slaven Bilic Lallana and Joel Matip both returned for Liverpool as Jurgen Klopp made two changes from the side that lost at Bournemouth, with Emre Can missing out through a knee injury. West Ham made four changes as Aaron Cresswell, Andre Ayew, Antonio and Havard Nordtveit were given the nod at Anfield following a 5-1 defeat by Arsenal. Liverpool players warm up prior to the match After a dramatic 4-3 defeat by Bournemouth last weekend, it initially looked more simple for Liverpool this time out as they took the lead after five minutes. After getting down the left wing, Mane's centre found Lallana eight yards out, and the midfielder stroked it into the bottom right corner past Randolph. There were warning signs early on for Liverpool, as Antonio got in behind Dejan Lovren and forced a save out of Karius, before West Ham equalised on 27 minutes. Adam Lallana (second from left) celebrates scoring the opening goal Payet, who had not scored for West Ham since October 1, curled a free-kick into the bottom left corner from 25 yards, though there were question marks over the positioning of Karius, who also got a palm to the effort. Anxiety grew in the Liverpool camp, and it was soon 2-1 to West Ham in somewhat fortuitous fashion. Michail Antonio (second from right) celebrates scoring Matip was left flat-footed as Nordtveit's hopeful drilled ball forward deflected off the head of Lovren, allowing Antonio to sneak in and poke the ball past Karius, who was caught in between racing out and staying closer to goal. Roberto Firmino then glanced a header wide as Liverpool reacted well before the break, while Matip's looping header from a corner bounced off the crossbar. They were back level just two minutes after the break through Origi, who reacted well to finish into an empty net from a few yards out after Randolph had failed to catch Mane's hopeful left-wing cross. Divock Origi scored Liverpool's second goal Gini Wijnaldum then fired wide from just inside the area a couple minutes later, while at the other end Ayew's diving header went a few yards wide of the left post. Jordan Henderson then lined one up from 30 yards out, forcing Randolph into a fine fingertip save as the ball headed for the top corner, as Liverpool dominated the second period. They could not find the winner, however, as West Ham's defence stood firm despite having little possession in the second half.

Everton Stefano Okaka scored his first two Watford goals as they moved up to seventh in the Premier League with a 3-2 victory over Everton at Vicarage Road. The Italy international opened his Hornets account with a spectacular back-heel on 36 minutes, cancelling out Romelu Lukaku’s 17th-minute opener. Sebastian Prodl hit his first goal of the season to give Watford the advantage early in the second half before Okaka doubled his tally on 64 minutes to put the game beyond the Toffees. Lukaku grabbed a lifeline for Ronald Koeman’s men four minutes from time but there was to be no way back for the Merseysiders, who have won just one of their last 10 league games. Meanwhile, Watford's first victory over Everton since 1987 sees them arrest a two-game losing streak and leapfrog their opponents in the process. Okaka wheels away in celebrations after scoring Watford's equaliser Missing the suspended Roberto Pereyra, Mazzarri was pleased to welcome Miguel Britos and Valon Behrami back into the Watford side after they missed last week's loss at West Brom. Koeman, meanwhile, drafted in Gerard Deulofeu to replace the injured Yannick Bolasie, and the Spaniard was an early menace on his first league start since mid-October. Occupied by Deulofeu's exuberant start, a puzzled Watford defence was carved open by Gareth Barry's first-time through ball as Lukaku was presented with the simple task of slotting the visitors ahead on the quarter-hour mark. Romelu Lukaku (R) slots low under Gomes to give Everton a 17th-minute lead Watford had two chances to peg the visitors back immediately, but Britos' wide header and captain Troy Deeney mis-control let the Everton defence off the hook. But the hosts were soon level thanks to a touch of class from Okaka who, having escaped Ashley Williams, nonchalantly flicked Nordin Amrabat's cross home to endear himself to the Watford faithful. One so nearly became two on 41 minutes but, distracted by Seamus Coleman's attempted clearance, Deeney sliced Adlene Guedioura's deep cross horribly wide from close range. Nordin Amrabat jostles with Leighton Baines for possession Everton had the ball in the Watford net at the start of a cagey second period, but Leighton Baines' effort was rightfully ruled out, with Coleman offside in the build-up. Two goals in five minutes then swung the game firmly in Watford's favours. First, a minute after heading a chance over from close range, Prodl steered Jose Holebas' fine delivery past a stricken Maarten Stekelenburg from close range. The Dutch goalkeeper was then helpless to prevent Okaka from doubling his tally with a glancing header as Watford ruthlessly punished hesitancy in the Everton defence. Sebastian Prodl scores Watford's second goal against Everton The Hornets then embarked on a resilience defence of their lead as Everton toiled for a route back into the game, which came with four minutes remaining when Lukaku stooped to head substitute Aaron Lennon's cross beyond Heurelho Gomes. Everton then had a penalty claim waved away as Britos escaped punishment from referee Anthony Taylor for climbing over substitute Enner Valencia, but it proved to be too little, too late as the visitors failed to ease the pressure on their manager.

Charlie Adam gave Stoke the lead from the penalty spot in the 29th minute after Granit Xhaka caught Joe Allen with an elbow. Arsenal replied before the break through Theo Walcott before Mesut Ozil put them ahead shortly after half-time with a lobbed header over Lee Grant. Substitute Alex Iwobi made sure of the points when he slid a shot past Grant in the 75th minute. The win sees the Gunners go top on goal difference ahead of Chelsea, who host West Brom on Nissan Super Sunday, and stretches their unbeaten run in the league to 14 matches Arsene Wenger stuck with the same side that thrashed West Ham last weekend, with Hector Bellerin returning on the bench after a month out with injury. Allen replaced Jon Walters for Stoke, who made a positive start. Marc Muniesa saw a well-struck volley from 30 yards tipped over before Xherdan Shaqiri spurned an opportunity to shoot when in space inside the box. Theo Walcott celebrates the equaliser Arsenal threatened when Walcott saw a low effort saved by Grant, but Stoke had the best early chance when Allen sliced wide as he ran on to Marko Arnautovic's pass in the area. The hosts were forced into a change shortly afterwards as Shkodran Mustafi was replaced by Bellerin, who offered more attacking threat down the right than Gabriel. However, they fell behind in the 29th minute as Xhaka clumsily elbowed Allen in the box and Adam converted the penalty. Arsene Wenger gives his thoughts on Arsenal's 3-1 win against Stoke Arsene Wenger gives his thoughts on Arsenal's 3-1 win against Stoke Arsenal struggled to mount any sustained pressure in response, and although Bellerin saw a shot deflected over, Arnautovic also went close at the other end as he was denied by a last-ditch block by Nacho Monreal. When the equaliser did arrive it was thanks to some slick passing as Alexis Sanchez slipped a brilliant ball through for Bellerin and his cross was turned in by Walcott. Sanchez and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain then fired over as the Gunners finished the half on top. Mesut Ozil scored Arsenal's second against Stoke They took the lead early in the second half as, with Erik Pieters just returning to the pitch after receiving treatment, Oxlade-Chamberlain clipped a ball over the defence for Ozil, who lobbed a header over Grant. While the Gunners largely looked in control with the lead, Stoke did come close to equalising on a couple of occasions. Mark Hughes speaks following Stoke’s 3-1 defeat at Arsenal Mark Hughes speaks following Stoke’s 3-1 defeat at Arsenal Mame Biram Diouf headed wide from a good position 10 yards out before Peter Crouch forced Petr Cech into a low save from a corner, immediately after coming on as a substitute. But Arsenal made sure of the points in the 75th minute as Sanchez was fouled on the left corner of the box, the referee played advantage and Iwobi collected the loose ball and finished past Grant. Walcott almost added a fourth but Grant pulled off a sharp low save to tip the ball away and keep it at 3-1.

The Clarets raced into a two-goal lead thanks to early strikes from Jeff Hendrick's wonder goal and Stephen Ward, only for the visitors to pull one back just before the break through Benik Afobe. However, George Boyd's 75th-minute strike gave the home side breathing space and it was needed after Charlie Daniels found the back of the net with a long-range effort in injury time at the end of the second half. As a result, Burnley move up to 13th in the table, five points from safety, while the Cherries slip to 11th. Burnley made four changes to the side that lost 2-0 at Stoke City last time out, with the likes of Tom Heaton, Steven Defour, Sam Vokes and Mathew Lowton all returning in place of Paul Robinson, Ashley Barnes, Andre Gray and Jon Flanagan. Eddie Howe, on his return to Turf Moor, made three alterations to the team that came from behind to stun Liverpool late on at the Vitality Stadium last Sunday, with on-loan Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere dropping to the bench, while both Junior Stanilas and Josh King missed out through injury. Bournemouth started the game passing the ball around nicely, with that morale-boosting 4-3 win against the Reds clearly still fresh in their minds, that is until Burnley took the lead totally out of the blue. Michael Keane found Hendrick, but there appeared little danger, that is until the midfielder controlled the ball with one touch, before volleying it over a helpless Artur Boruc in Bournemouth's goal with his next. And before the Cherries could even catch their breath, they found themselves 2-0 down, although on this occasion there was plenty they could have done to prevent the goal. George Boyd (R) celebrates after scoring Burnley's third goal against Bournemouth Defour swung a right-wing corner straight on to Ben Mee's head, although the defender's effort from near the penalty spot was lacking both the power and direction to really trouble Boruc. The Poland goalkeeper, though, was unable to gather the ball cleanly, with Ward in the right place at the right time to tap home from virtually on the goal line for his first strike since January 2012. However, Bournemouth responded well to falling two goals behind, as they also did against Liverpool last weekend, and crucially got themselves back into the contest in first-half stoppage time after a well-worked goal. Ryan Fraser, who was man of the match against the Reds, found right-back Simon Francis charging down the wing, and his inch-perfect cross was converted by the unmarked Afobe from 10 yards out to hand the visitors a lifeline. But in a cagey second half, it was the hosts who crucially got the next goal with 15 minutes to go after a gorgeous back heel from substitute Andre Gray released Boyd, with the Scotland midfielder doing well to beat Boruc with a low shot into the bottom right-hand corner of the net from an acute angle. Amazingly, that strike from Boyd meant Burnley have now scored more goals at Turf Moor this campaign than they managed in the whole of the season last time they were in the Premier League. The home side, however, were still made to sweat at the death as first Afobe had a goal ruled out for handball in the last minute in what was a tight call by referee Martin Atkinson, before Daniels made it an anxious last few seconds after thumping home an unstoppable strike in the first of the four extra minutes added on at the end of the game.

3-3 Crystal Palace Hull and Crystal Palace ended up sharing the spoils after serving up a pulsating afternoon of pre-Christmas Premier League football at the KCOM Stadium. A breathless encounter finished 3-3 in the end, having featured two penalties, one of them hugely controversial, a goal of the season candidate, and a dramatic late equaliser from Palace sub Fraizer Campbell. Having scored twice in quick succession to hit back from 2-1 down, struggling Hull will be disappointed not to have held on to claim what would have been a huge three points. But a draw was probably the right result, especially considering the hosts were fortunate to be in front at the break, Robert Snodgrass having converted a penalty after going down untouched in the area. Wilfried Zaha was superb for Palace and the speedy wide man burst into the box after just five minutes, only to be denied by an excellent fingertip save from David Marshall. Palace were the better side early on but Hull, who fielded three centre-backs as part of a reconfigured defence, gradually began to settle into the match. Snodgrass put Hull ahead after they were controversially awarded a penalty And they looked set to take the lead when Adama Diomande raced through, only for the alert Wayne Hennessey to sprint out of his goal and save the shot with his chest. The hosts then went 1-0 up in highly contentious fashion, Snodgrass going to ground as he tried to latch onto an Andrew Robertson cross, with replays suggesting Scott Dann had successfully pulled out of the tackle. Snodgrass, who was already on a booking, was unfazed by the furore the decision provoked, slamming a fine penalty into the top corner, as Hennessey went the wrong way. The goal seemed to unsettle Palace and Hull looked fairly comfortable either side of the break, only for Snodgrass to then make a major impact once again. But this time the Hull man was on the other side of a decision, giving away a penalty himself when he tripped Zaha as the Palace man twisted and turned in the corner of the area. Christian Benteke [52] stepped up and calmly sent Marshall the wrong way from the spot, side-footing the ball into the net to level the scores. Adama Diomande of Hull scores their second goal during a great game at the KCOM Jason Puncheon went on to have a shot beaten away by Marshall, before Zaha conjured up a wonder goal with 20 minutes left to play. Not much appeared on when a corner was cleared to the Palace man but he controlled the ball skilfully, produced a superb bit of trickery to jink his way past two defenders, and capped his moment of genius with a thunderous shot which rocketed into the roof of the net. However, Hull were inspired by this setback and levelled with a really well-taken goal of their own two minutes later, Diomande receiving from Harry Maguire and cleverly flicking the ball through Dann's legs as he turned, before dinking his shot over Hennessey. Diomande almost doubled his tally moments later, Martin Kelly pulling off a vital block, but Hull were not to be denied for long. Jake Livermore [78] exchanged passes with Snodgrass and then cruised into the heart of the Palace box, before slipping a clever shot into the corner of the net. A fortnight after an agonising 5-4 loss at Swansea, Palace appeared set for another high-scoring away defeat, but Zaha had one more card left to play. Fraizer Campbell's header earned Palace a share of the points The man of the match skipped down the right and then sent over a delightful cross, which former Hull loanee Campbell nodded into the net at the near post, having been introduced from the bench with 10 minutes to play. Despite four minutes of stoppage time, that was just about an end to the drama, and Hull head into a tough run of fixtures still in the drop zone but at least fresh from showing more punch in attack than in some matches of late. Palace are three points clear of the drop zone and, while the concession of three more away goals will be a concern, they should have no relegation problems if Zaha can maintain such exhilarating form.

"Swansea 3-0 Sunderland: Fernando Llorente scores twice to lift Swans out of drop zone FT Swansea 3 - 0 Sunderland FT Swansea 3 - 0 Sunderland Swansea moved out of the relegation zone after Fernando Llorente struck twice in a 3-0 home victory over Sunderland. The result lifted Bob Bradley's side out of the relegation zone, with David Moyes' Black Cats dropping to the bottom of the Premier League table. Gylfi Sigurdsson broke the deadlock from the penalty spot six minutes into the second half, after Jason Denayer was adjudged to have handled Wayne Routledge's delivery. Fernando Llorente doubled the advantage just three minutes later, sweeping home from Sigurdsson's corner with a deft, close-range finish. And Llorente made the game safe 10 minutes from time by connecting with Jefferson Montero's left-wing cross and heading past Jordan Pickford. Unsurprisingly, there were five changes made by Bradley in the wake of last weekend's 5-0 defeat at Tottenham. The first half was a scrappy affair, however, with neither side done any favours by the heavy rain pre-match which continued to fall once the action was underway. David Moyes gives his reaction on his teams 3-0 loss away at Swansea. David Moyes gives his reaction on his teams 3-0 loss away at Swansea. Jermain Defoe went close for the visitors on 20 minutes after being picked out by strike partner Victor Anichebe, while Jordi Amat should have done better with a 38th-minute header that he glanced over. Sunderland almost went in front on the stroke of half time as Lamine Kone's effort flew inches off target, before the game finally sprung into life on 51 minutes when Swansea were awarded a penalty. Denayer was unable to get his arm out of the way as Routledge attempted to deliver a cross, allowing Sigurdsson to drill a spot-kick straight down the middle, giving Pickford no chance. Bob Bradley says Swansea are working together in a good way after their 3-0 win against Sunderland. Bob Bradley says Swansea are working together in a good way after their 3-0 win against Sunderland. Only a stunning save from the Sunderland goalkeeper somehow kept out Modou Barrow after he had been put through by an excellent Sigurdsson pass. But Pickford was powerless to prevent Llorente doubling the hosts advantage; the striker firing in from inside the box. Sigurdsson and the impressive Leon Britton, back in the starting line-up for his 474th Swansea appearance, were now pulling all the strings as Swansea continued to dominate. Sunderland were almost back in it midway through the half when Defoe placed a low shot just wide from the edge of the area. However, the outcome was put beyond all doubt in the 80th minute as Routledge released Montero on the left and Llorente made no mistake with a fine header.

Leicester, who hadn't won in the league in five games, raced into a 3-0 lead in just 20 minutes in a first half to forget for Pep Guardiola's side, as Vardy netted either side of Andy King's effort from the edge of the area. Vardy got his hat-trick with 12 minutes remaining, scoring from an acute angle on the right byline after latching onto John Stones' poor backpass. Andy King wheels away with team-mates as Leicester go 2-0 up Aleksandar Kolarov and Nolito scored late on for City, who have taken just 12 points from a possible 27 in the league. The result means City are four points off leaders Arsenal, and could be seven behind Chelsea if they beat West Brom at midday on Sunday. Guardiola made four changes from the side that lost 3-1 against Chelsea last week, bringing in Pablo Zabaleta, Bacary Sagna, Fernando and Kelechi Iheanacho, with Sergio Aguero, Nicolas Otamendi and Fernandinho suspended. City were caught out early on as Islam Slimani played Vardy through on goal after a long ball forward, and the England striker found the bottom left corner past Claudio Bravo for his first goal in 16 matches. Jamie Vardy celebrates scoring his side's third goal with Islam Slimani Leicester were 2-0 up within five minutes through King, who beat Bravo into the top left corner from the edge of the area, though the Chilean goalkeeper could have done better after getting a palm on the effort. Leicester could have been 3-0 up on 13 minutes, but Slimani couldn't keep his effort from six yards down after Robert Huth had nodded the ball on unmarked. However, they did get their third seven minutes later. After referee Michael Oliver had diverted Kolarov's pass into the path of Christian Fuchs, the Austrian's long ball forward reached Riyad Mahrez, whose superb touch into the area found Vardy running through on goal. With City defenders on the back foot, Vardy rounded Bravo and finished into the empty net. Mahrez nearly made it four himself minutes later, but Bravo this time beat the ball away to his right after the Algerian's fizzing effort towards the corner. The visitors pressed intensely for the rest of the half, earning seven corners in total, but Kolarov could not head into the net after Fernando had flicked on Kevin De Bruyne's set piece from the left. Slimani went close in first-half stoppage time, miscuing his header to divert the ball wide unmarked from Marc Albrighton's right-wing cross. City continued to dominate possession after the break but with no cutting edge, as Zabaleta and De Bruyne both saw goal-bound efforts blocked, before Ilkay Gundogan struck inches wide from the edge of the box before the hour mark. Vardy got his hat-trick on 78 minutes, capitalising on Stones' weak backpass for Bravo by rounding the goalkeeper and netting from an impossibly acute angle on the right byline. The ball rolled off the far post, but the goal-line technology gave the goal as Sagna failed to clear in time. Kolarov's superb free-kick from 20 yards gave the travelling fans something to smile about, before substitute Nolito scored in the 90th minute with a near post finish from Kolarov's cross. It wasn't enough to create a nervy finish as Leicester, who registered just 22 per cent possession in the game, claimed a vital win.

"report": "Middlesbrough 1-0 Hull Middlesbrough 1-0 Hull Gaston Ramirez's header was enough for Middlesbrough to see off a lacklustre Hull side 1-0 in the Premier League on Monday Night Football. The hosts dominated for much of the 90 minutes and could have scored more, but a header from the former Tigers man on the hour mark sealed a much-needed three points for Aitor Karanka's men. Boro had a first-half goal from Viktor Fischer disallowed for offside, while Hull only pushed for an equaliser in the final 10 minutes but were unable to find the breakthrough. Middlesbrough's second home win of the season sees them up to 13th - four points clear of the relegation zone - while Hull stay second from bottom. Adam Forshaw is tracked by Markus Henriksen during the match The hosts had their first effort of the opening period in the eighth minute as Ramirez surged down the right flank, finding Marten de Roon at the top of the box. He took one touch to put the ball into the path of Alvaro Negredo - but the striker could only fire over the crossbar from six yards out. Ramirez was again involved three minutes later as he fired a storming effort towards goal after a delightful back heel from Adam Forshaw, but Hull stopper David Marshall made a great leaping save to deny him before Sam Clucas shot over the crossbar at the other end in one of only a handful of first-half chances for the visitors. Marshall pushed away a Forshaw shot just after the 20-minute mark and then Middlesbrough thought they had made the much deserved breakthrough 13 minutes later. Ramirez put another great ball into the box from the right, with Negredo getting above Ahmed Elmohamady at the back post to nod the ball into the path of Fischer. After a goalmouth scramble, he fired home past Jake Livermore but was flagged for offside and the goal was ruled out. Negredo missed another great chance in the 39th minute as Forshaw played a lovely cross to him at the back post, but he somehow skewed his header wide before Middlesbrough's captain - who had little defending to do in the first half - made a fine tackle to stop the run of Adama Diomande in the box just before the break. Viktor Fischer has his head in his hands after his goal is ruled offside The second half picked up where the first had left off, with Middlesbrough continuing to see the majority of possession and chances as Hull rooted themselves into their own half but their defence was breached on the hour mark. It came from a Middlesbrough corner that was delivered by Fischer, finding an unmarked Ramirez, who glanced the ball past Marshall and Andrew Robertson on the line to deservedly put the hosts ahead. Hull goalkeeper David Marshall saves a shot from striker Alvaro Negredo Negredo went close for the hosts in 76th minute as De Roon played a delightful ball from the left flank but the Spaniard skewed his header just wide. It was a similar story at the other end just a minute later as Clucas fired a header over the crossbar from a whistling Snodgrass corner. Hull twice went close to stealing a draw in added time as Victor Valdes produced a fingertip save to deny Diomande with a superb curling effort. Seconds later, the Norwegian striker just missed a headed knockdown from Ahmed Elmohamady at the back post after another Snodgrass corner. Ramirez celebrates after scoring against Hull But it was too little, too late for the Tigers as they couldn't find a breakthrough and Middlesbrough deservedly kept all three points at the Riverside Stadium.

Ake scores Bournemouth's winner against Liverpool Sadio Mane (20) and Divock Origi (22) put the visitors in control at half-time, and they looked comfortable again when Emre Can restored their two-goal cushion (64) following Callum Wilson's 56th-minute penalty, won by substitute Ryan Fraser. But Bournemouth stunned their opponents with a late rally as Fraser pulled one back himself (76) before setting up Steve Cook's equaliser two minutes later (78). Eddie Howe gives his reaction to Bournemouth's stunning win over Liverpool Eddie Howe gives his reaction to Bournemouth's stunning win over Liverpool Ake's late finish snatched the three points and secured Bournemouth's first ever win over Liverpool, sending the Cherries up to 10th in the Premier League table. Liverpool, who face West Ham next live on Sky Sports, remain third, having missed the chance to return to second. Jurgen Klopp made six changes from the team that beat Leeds 2-0 in midweek, and his side deservedly raced into a two-goal lead. The home side, who restored Jack Wilshere and Artur Boruc to their line-up, were overrun in the early stages and fell behind when Mane beat Ake for pace and poked in from close range. Jurgen Klopp heaped praise on Bournemouth's fighting spirit Jurgen Klopp heaped praise on Bournemouth's fighting spirit Origi added Liverpool's second two minutes later, rounding Boruc and finishing superbly from a tight angle.

Can seemed to have given Liverpool the breathing space required to see the game out when he curled past Boruc from 18 yards, but his strike simply set the stage for Bournemouth's comeback. Emre Can scored Liverpool's third with a curling effort Fraser fired past Loris Karius before his cross was expertly controlled and finished by Cook as the hosts struck twice in two minutes to level. With Liverpool on the back foot, Benik Afobe saw a low effort saved well by Karius, but the Reds goalkeeper failed to cover himself in glory for Bournemouth's winner. He spilled Cook's long-range drive, allowing Ake to steal in and tap home.

draw 1-1 with Manchester United at Goodison Park on Sunday. United, for whom Marcos Rojo escaped an early red card for a two-footed challenge on Idrissa Gueye, took the lead in the 42nd minute when Maarten Stekelenburg came out of his area to try and win a ball over the top and was lobbed by Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Ander Herrera crashed a shot against the post on the hour mark, but it still looked like United had done enough until a late push from the hosts. Leighton Baines celebrates his late equaliser They equalised in the 89th mintue when former Everton midfielder Marouane Fellaini, who had just come on as a substitute, fouled Gueye in the box and Baines stepped up to convert the penalty. The draw continues an inconsistent run of results for United, who have not won back-to-back Premier League games since August. Although Everton's own form has been worse in recent months, they should be happier with the point having largely been second best in a cagey encounter. Jose Mourinho insists his Manchester United side deserved to beat Everton Jose Mourinho insists his Manchester United side deserved to beat Everton After defeat to Southampton last weekend, Ronald Koeman made three changes, with Ramiro Funes Mori, Kevin Mirallas and Tom Cleverley starting ahead of Phil Jagielka, Ross Barkley and Aaron Lennon. Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Anthony Martial started for United after impressing in the EFL Cup win over West Ham in midweek. Zlatan Ibrahimovic lobs the ball in for United's opener But neither side created much in a first half with only two real notable incidents. The first came in the 16th minute as Rojo dived in two-footed on Gueye and was fortunate to only be shown a yellow card. That looked as though it would be the only talking point as both teams laboured and struggled to get into any sort of rhythm, not helped by numerous misplaced passes. Ronald Koeman was pleased with Everton's organisation and attitude as they rescued a late point Ronald Koeman was pleased with Everton's organisation and attitude as they rescued a late point But United were handed the lead in the 42nd minute as Stekelenburg came a long way out of his goal to try and win the ball before Ibrahimovic, who was being shadowed by a defender. The decision proved to be misjudged as Ibrahimovic chipped the ball over his former Ajax team-mate and it went in off the underside of the bar. There were boos from some home fans at the break, and there was little change in the second half. Manchester United's Phil Jones was left deflated after the late equaliser Manchester United's Phil Jones was left deflated after the late equaliser Mirallas did at least force De Gea into a sharp stop after getting into the box, but Herrera should have made it 2-0 when he smashed against the post from the corner of the six-yard area. Everton, after losing Seamus Coleman and Yannick Bolasie to injuries, eventually managed to build some momentum late in the game. De Gea kept out a swerving shot from Gueye and then tipped away a header from Mason Holgate. Gary Neville says Mourinho has been let down by a poor piece of decision making by Marouane Fellaini Gary Neville says Mourinho has been let down by a poor piece of decision making by Marouane Fellaini It looked as though the best chance had gone when substitute Enner Valencia headed at De Gea from six yards out.

City took the lead on the stroke of half-time courtesy of a Gary Cahill own goal before second-half strikes from Diego Costa and Willian swung the game in Chelsea's favour. Antonio Conte was left delighted by the result and was particularly pleased with the character his Chelsea players showed Antonio Conte was left delighted by the result and was particularly pleased with the character his Chelsea players showed Costa's equaliser on 60 minutes came after a period of relentless City pressure during which Kevin De Bruyne missed a glorious chance from just four yards out. Eden Hazard wrapped up the points in injury time to stretch Chelsea's winning run to eight games in the league but that was not the end of the drama as Sergio Aguero was dismissed for an ugly tackle on David Luiz before Fernandino followed him down the tunnel for an altercation with Cesc Fabregas. Watch the unsavoury scenes that happened at the end of Man City's 3-1 home defeat against Chelsea that resulted in red cards for Aguero and Fernandinho Watch the unsavoury scenes that happened at the end of Man City's 3-1 home defeat against Chelsea that resulted in red cards for Aguero and Fernandinho The victory moves Chelsea four points clear at the top of the Premier League while City, who were four points clear themselves at the end of September, have now taken just 12 points from their last eight games. Much was made of the tactical battle between the two managers in the build-up and Pep Guardiola decided to match Conte's 3-4-3 formation. Antonio Conte and Pep Guardiola embrace Guardiola made six changes from the team that beat Burnley 2-1 last weekend with David Silva and De Bruyne back in the starting line-up. Raheem Sterling, Yaya Toure, Nolito, Fernando, Gael Clichy and Bacary Sagna were the six players to drop out. It was just the single change for Conte, who lost Nemanja Matic to a \"small muscular problem\" with Fabregas replacing him. John Stones is put under pressure by Diego Costa Despite City starting with good intent, it was Hazard who had the first shot when curling an effort from 20 yards inches wide of the post after 15 minutes. Aguero tested Thibaut Courtois from a similar distance 10 minutes later but the goalkeeper helped it on its way over the crossbar. Eden Hazard of Chelsea goes past Nicolas Otamendi City did have the ball in the net moments later but Fernandinho's header from close range was ruled out as he was a yard offside from De Bruyne's set-piece. Luiz was thrust into the spotlight on 30 minutes as he obstructed Aguero as he attempted to latch onto a poor back-pass by Cesar Azpilicueta. Pep Guardiola felt Manchester City played well despite losing, and said that his team created chances but were not strong enough in the box Pep Guardiola felt Manchester City played well despite losing, and said that his team created chances but were not strong enough in the box It seemed like referee Anthony Taylor was about to blow for the free-kick - and potentially a red card for Luiz as the last man - but ended up waving play on, much to the annoyance of the home fans. Those boos turned to cheers just before half-time though as City took the lead. Jesus Navas swung a hopeful ball into the near post and Cahill awkwardly swung a right foot at the ball which deflected into the top corner. Manchester City's Jesus Navas (R) celebrates after his cross is put in the net for an own-goal by Chelsea's Gary Cahill The goal visibly shook Chelsea but City were unable to take advantage of their defensive frailties De Bruyne snuck in behind but was denied at the near post by Courtois before Cahill and Marcus Alonso got into bother on the edge of their box but Aguero's effort was cleared off the line by the former. De Bruyne should have doubled City's lead on 57 minutes after they opened up Chelsea down the right flank. Ilkay Gundogan rolled the ball across for the Belgian but with the goal gaping he could only hit the crossbar Gianfranco Zola feels Chelsea's victory is a huge statement for the Premier League title Gianfranco Zola feels Chelsea's victory is a huge statement for the Premier League title And the miss would prove to be costly as Chelsea found their stride and were level three minutes later, Costa bringing down a Fabregas ball over the top, before beating Nicolas Otamendi and firing low into the net from 15 yards. The game was now end-to-end and it was Chelsea that showed a more lethal instinct with Costa the architect. He bruised his way past a timid Otamendi tackle in midfield and released substitute Willian, who shot low into the corner (70). Chelsea's Brazilian-born Spanish striker Diego Costa points to his black armband as he celebrates scoring his team's first goal City had little response and it was left to Hazard to dance away past Alexander Kolarov in injury time to seal the points. With the clock running down, the game ended on a sour note as Aguero launched into a reckless high tackle on Luiz by the touchline, both benches getting involved in the melee that followed. The red card was brandished to Aguero and also Fernandinho, who appeared to grab Fabregas by the throat as City lost their cool as well as the game.

zone as they ended a run of six straight defeats with a 3-0 victory over Southampton at Selhurst Park. Birthday boy Christian Benteke scored twice but the Eagles also owe a debt of gratitude to Southampton's England goalkeeper Fraser Forster, who made a big blunder to hand them the lead. Benteke (33) capitalised on the mistake and James Tomkins then doubled the lead three minutes later, as the home fans really began to enjoy their afternoon. Tomkins doubled the Palace lead A lacklustre Southampton side were improved after the break but squandered a couple of chances and Benteke, who turned 26 today, put them out of their misery five minutes from time, Palace ending a run of six successive defeats in style. The atmosphere was subdued during a quiet first half-hour, Benteke heading Palace's best chance wide while Sofiane Boufal had a shot blocked at the other end after a delightful piece of skill.

Moments later, the hosts doubled their advantage. Palace have been vulnerable from set-pieces this season but the boot was on the other foot here as Joe Ledley flicked on Jason Puncheon's low corner, Tomkins afforded space to rifle the ball into the net from close range. Virgil van Dijk reacts after Southampton fell 2-0 behind The mood around the ground was very different now and the home fans had a great time barracking the unfortunate Forster, whose error came in front of watching England boss Gareth Southgate. Southampton posed a little more threat in attack after the interval and youngster Josh Sims, introduced from the bench, shot over the bar after cutting inside, before Wayne Hennessey kept out a near post header from another sub, Shane Long. Alan Pardew praised the fans for creating a positive atmosphere at Selhurst Park as his side got a much needed win Alan Pardew praised the fans for creating a positive atmosphere at Selhurst Park as his side got a much needed win The ball bounced around from the subsequent corner, hitting the bar at one point after Virgil van Dijk's looping header, and eventually found its way to Fonte, who summed up Southampton's day by volleying a very presentable chance wide of the target.

their fifth Premier League win in seven games with a 2-0 victory over a below-par Burnley. Stoke took the lead through Walters' expert first-time finish on the 20-minute mark - his first goal since March - before Marc Muniesa (35) connected with Marko Arnautovic's low cross and arrowed in a stunning volley to score his first Premier League goal. While the in-form Potters are ninth in the table, the Clarets sit three points above the relegation places after a fifth defeat in six on the road. Marc Muniesa celebrates scoring his team's second goal Burnley, buoyed by the return of Andre Gray, had set up well, yet they had a scare after 10 minutes when Bruno Martins Indi met Xherdan Shaqiri's cross. He should have buried it, but instead it was easily cleared by Scott Arfield. When Stoke's opener did come, it came from an unlikely source, Walters guiding Mame Biram Diouf's cross over the head of Paul Robinson and into the far corner to become the first Stoke player to reach 40 Premier League goals. Stoke manager Mark Hughes says he is delighted with his side's form after they beat Burnley 2-0 Stoke manager Mark Hughes says he is delighted with his side's form after they beat Burnley 2-0 This sparked Mark Hughes' men into action, as Arnautovic almost played Walters in again just moments later, but the referee flagged for offside. Ben Mee helped to keep the scoreline as tame as possible, but despite his best efforts, he was helpless to prevent Muniesa doubling the lead 10 minutes before the break. Jonathan Walters (R) celebrates with Xherdan Shaqiri Arnautovic entered the 18-yard box and crossed to the ex-Barcelona man, whose first-time volley beat Robinson to secure the points for the hosts. Minutes prior to the break, Jeff Hendrick attempted to lob Lee Grant from close range, but he summed up his side's lack of attacking purpose, with a weak execution that Grant managed to palm away calmly. Sean Dyche says his Burnley side need to do more if they are to start picking up points away from home Sean Dyche says his Burnley side need to do more if they are to start picking up points away from home The second half began much like the first as Burnley enjoyed some early possession but the promise ebbed away when they were unable to force a way through the Potters' equally solid defence. Gray was outmuscled time after time, while Ashley Barnes - making his first start of the season - was continually frustrated, and visibly so. Scott Arfield attempts to score from a free-kick against Stoke for Burnley Just after the hour mark, Barnes found himself lucky to still be on the field after a dangerous elbow in the face of Martins Indi, just moments after Hendrick received his final warning for a virtual headlock on Walters. Stoke's unlikely top scorer, Joe Allen, entered the fray, along with Peter Crouch and the pair had chances to set one another up; Crouch reminding everyone what he is capable of with a thumping volley that was just blocked off by Mee. Sean Dyche brought on his own top scorer in Sam Vokes late on, but it proved to be too little too late, as his side recorded a third straight defeat and continued their miserable away run.

Cats off bottom with victory over champions Sunderland 2-1 Leicester Sunderland 2-1 Leicester Sunderland's revival continued as a 2-1 victory over Leicester helped them move off the bottom of the Premier League table. Robert Huth's own goal and a Jermain Defoe strike put Sunderland two clear at the Stadium of Light before Shinji Okazaki got one back for Leicester with 10 minutes to go. Late heroics from goalkeeper Jordan Pickford denied Wes Morgan from levelling in the dying minutes, and Sunderland held on for their third win in four league games. David Moyes says his Sunderland side dealt well with Leicester's quality David Moyes says his Sunderland side dealt well with Leicester's quality Defeat for Leicester meanwhile puts them down in 15th - just two points above the relegation zone having picked up just two points in their last five games. Sunderland were looking to build on an impressive November which saw them take six points from three league games and earned David Moyes a nomination for manager of the month. Claudio Ranieri and David Moyes were all smiles ahead of kick-off The hosts were quick out the blocks, with Duncan Watmore forcing a save from Ron-Robert Zieler after just one minute. Sunderland continued to dominate, and Morgan threw himself in front of Victor Anichebe and Defoe strikes to keep the hosts at bay. Claudio Ranieri admits things aren't going right at Leicester Claudio Ranieri admits things aren't going right at Leicester Defoe went close again, but he uncharacteristically scuffed his effort from eight yards out with only the goalkeeper to beat. Leicester took a while to get going but looked stronger as the first half went on, and Vardy went close with a series of headers. Jamie Vardy of Leicester City and Steven Pienaar compete for the ball Vardy's best chance came after a Christian Fuchs' cross found the striker, but his glancing header sailed narrowly wide beyond the far post. After the break, Islam Slimani almost broke the deadlock but his effort was blocked by Papy Djilobodji - with subsequent appeals for handball turned down. Sunderland's Jan Kirchhoff (third left) celebrates his goal against Leicester The game burst into life after the hour-mark, and it was Sunderland who took the lead in the 64th minute. A Sebastian Larsson cross was met by Jan Kirchhoff, and his header ricocheted off the helpless Huth and bobbled into the Leicester net. Watch as Paul Merson struggles with some of Sunderland's players' names during their win over Leicester Watch as Paul Merson struggles with some of Sunderland's players' names during their win over Leicester It got worse for the visitors as Defoe made amends for his earlier miss with a clinical finish after Morgan blocked Watmore's initial effort. The two-goal lead did not last long however, as Okazaki cleverly turned the ball in from Demarai Gray's cross with 10 minutes left. Sunderland players celebrate following Robert Huth's own goal Six minutes were added on after Watmore was stretchered off, and Leicester's best chance to equalise came in the fifth minute of stoppage time. A Leicester cross fell to Morgan eight yards out, and the captain connected well with the effort but was denied by the strong hand of Pickford. The goalkeeper's celebrations after the stop told of its significance, and the full-time whistle was blown barely a minute after to the joy of the home supporters.

Before kick-off White Hart Lane observed a minute's silence as a mark of respect to Brazilian club Chapecoense and all those who lost their lives this week in the Colombia air disaster. Once the action got underway, there was an early stoppage as a high boot from Kyle Naughton caught Kyle Walker in the face, but after a lengthy period of treatment the full-back recovered to continue.

In the 20th minute Walker whipped in a dangerous cross which picked out Kane, but the England international was again denied by Fabianski, who tipped his header over the bar. But Spurs finally broke the deadlock in the 39th minute and it was Kane, who grabbed the goal from the penalty spot after Naughton was adjudged to have brought down Alli in the penalty area. Harry Kane scores Tottenham's first from the spot Referee Jon Moss eventually pointed to the spot and Kane made no mistake, converting to score his sixth league goal of the season. On the stroke of half-time it was two as Son produced a moment of magic with an acrobatic half volley to beat Fabianski at his near post to put Spurs in full control going into the break.

The hosts punished Swansea on the counter and Kane started the move which involved Dele Alli, Eriksen and Son. Jay Fulton puts Mousa Dembele under pressure The South Korean international worked his way into the penalty area but he failed to get his shot away before Kane muscled his way in and powered a low shot past Fabianski to score his eighth goal of the campaign. Kane thought he had brought up his hat-trick just after the hour-mark but his goal was ruled out by the assistant referee who flagged correctly for offside.

West Brom's 3-1 win over Watford on Saturday, which saw them move into the top six West Brom leapfrogged Watford into the Premier League's top six after a fiery 3-1 win at The Hawthorns on Saturday. Two set-piece goals from Jonny Evans and Chris Brunt in the first half helped Tony Pulis' side into the lead despite Watford's strong start, before Christian Kabasele pulled one back for the visitors after the break. Walter Mazzarri was furious with a number of refereeing decisions as his side searched for an equaliser, with Roberto Pereyra seeing red late on for Watford, who sit bottom of the fairplay table. Matt Phillips sealed the win in added time Matt Phillips sealed the win against their 10-man opponents with a sweet strike in added time to see West Brom also move above Manchester United and Everton ahead of their Super Sunday clash. Pulis - who was this week assured his job was safe despite a High Court ruling he must pay former club Crystal Palace £3.7m - named an unchanged West Brom side from the 1-1 draw at Hull City, while Mazzarri was forced into four changes to his team which lost 1-0 to Stoke last weekend. West Brom boss Tony Pulis says his side didn't play as well as they have been doing, but dug in for the win West Brom boss Tony Pulis says his side didn't play as well as they have been doing, but dug in for the win Mazzarri also switched to a 4-4-2 formation, which pegged West Brom back in the opening stages, with Nordin Amrabat's swinging strike forcing a surprised Ben Foster into a smart save inside a minute. Asked about West Brom's set-piece threat before the game, Mazzarri said his side \"knew their characteristics well\" but it was the hosts' first corner of the match which swung the game in their favour, Evans outmuscling Kabasele to meet Brunt's delivery on 16. Evans headed in from a corner to give West Brom the lead Watford came back into the game with Amrabat again causing problems, but his goal-bound effort was blocked by team-mate Stefano Okaka. West Brom made the visitors pay from another set-piece though, with Brunt's drilled free-kick deflecting off Zuniga in the Watford wall and past the helpless Heurelho Gomes (34) to make it 2-0. Watford boss Walter Mazzarri says West Brom's second goal shouldn't have stood and felt Roberto Pereyra was unfairly sent off Watford boss Walter Mazzarri says West Brom's second goal shouldn't have stood and felt Roberto Pereyra was unfairly sent off The visitors' best attacking threat came through Amrabat, whose cross almost led to Troy Deeney pulling Watford back into the game shortly after half time, but for a vital Gareth McAuley block. Kabasele did pull a goal back for Watford with their own set-piece in the 61st minute though, poking Deeney's effort over the line from close range after Amrabat's corner. Walter Mazzarri defended his side's discipline before the game, but was unhappy with some refereeing decisions Mazzarri was unhappy with referee Graham Scott as a number of decisions went against the away side when searching for an equaliser and a frustrated Watford, who had already collected 33 yellow cards and committed 184 fouls before kick-off, received a red card in the 84th minute when Pereyra appeared to kick out at James McClean. With a man advantage Phillips sealed the points for West Brom with a superb curling strike in added time after a neat one-two with Darren Fletcher, giving Albion their third win in four league games.

"Sign in to watch highlights of Arsenal's 5-1 victory over West Ham Sign in to watch highlights of Arsenal's 5-1 victory over West Ham Alexis Sanchez stole the show with a hat-trick as Arsenal moved second in the table and heaped more pressure on Slaven Bilic's West Ham with a comprehensive 5-1 victory at the London Stadium. Having set up Mesut Ozil for Arsenal's opener on 24 minutes, Sanchez capped a stunning individual display with three goals in 15 second-half minutes. Andy Carroll's marked his long awaited return to the West Ham first-team with a goal nine minutes from time but Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's response a minute later ensured it was mere consolation for the hosts, who remain a point above the relegation zone and without a league win since mid-October. For Arsenal, a first victory at their London rivals' new home sees them extend their unbeaten run in the league to 13 games and remain three points off leaders Chelsea. With first-team regulars Michail Antonio and Aaron Cresswell out injured, West Ham could ill afford another defensive injury against an Arsenal side they've not beaten on home turf in the top-flight in over a decade. But, with just five minutes on the clock, that was exactly what happened as James Collins was forced off. Dimitri Payet was unable to influence the game against a rampant Arsenal side Alvaro Arbeloa replaced the Welshman but the Spaniard appeared off-guard as the Gunners exposed his lack of preparation. Nacho Monreal twice got the better of his compatriot on 13 minutes but crucial interventions from Angelo Ogbonna and Winston Reid prevented Arsenal from taking the lead. A subdued West Ham took 19 minutes to fashion their first chance, Petr Cech alert at his near post to tip Manuel Lanzini's effort out for a corner. Edimilson Fernandes and Gabriel contest for the ball at the London Stadium But just as the hosts looked to be finding their rhythm in attack, Arsenal pounced on a defensive lapse to take a deserved lead. After Francis Coquelin had blocked Ogbonna's sloppy pass, Sanchez skipped past Reid and through on goal he unselfishly squared for Ozil to notch his eighth goal of the season. It was no more than the Gunners deserved, and they should have been out of sight by half-time but a combination of Darren Randolph and Reid were on hand to thwart Sanchez on 36 minutes. Mesut Ozil thanks Alexis Sanchez after his selfless assist for the opener The Hammers sought refuge at the interval, and looked to strike fear into the Arsenal camp by sending Carroll out to warm up. Bilic, however, opted not to bring Carroll on immediately, a decision which almost paid dividends as the impressive Ashley Fletcher flashed a shot wide on 55 minutes. Arsenal soon regained control though, and only a perfectly-timed Ogbonna block and a fine double save from Randolph kept West Ham in the game. Mesut Ozil congratulates Sanchez after opener But there was only so much the hosts could withstand as Sanchez's stunning solo effort - spinning away from Arthur Masuaku before beating Randolph - on 72 minutes doubled the Gunners' advantage. His instinctive first-time finish eight minutes later made it three and marked the start of a frantic final 10 minutes which would see four goals scored. Within three minutes, Carroll, making his first appearance since mid-August, headed home from close range after Dimitri Payet's sensational free-kick had cannoned off the frame of the Arsenal goal. Alexis Sanchez celebrates at the London Stadium West Ham's faint hopes of a comeback, though, were extinguished a minute later when Oxlade-Chamberlain's fizzing drive restored Arsenal's three-goal lead. It was then left for Sanchez to complete his hat-trick with a audacious chipped finish three minutes from time as Arsenal remained firmly in the title race.

Adam looked to have barged Valon Beharami to meet the corner, just before the half-hour mark, but the goal stood and ultimately proved decisive. Walter Mazzarri appeared to snub Mark Hughes' handshake at the final whistle in what was a disappointing day all round for the home side. Miguel Britos was sent off in added time as Watford were found frustrated when chasing an equaliser late in the game, while Younes Kaboul was forced off injured early in the first half. Heurelho Gomes' own goal handed Stoke victory at Watford The win pushes Stoke into the top half of the Premier League table, just two points behind Watford - who missed out on the opportunity to reach the top six. Hughes rung the changes after Stoke's home defeat to Bournemouth last weekend, leaving out Wilfried Bony and Bojan alongside suspended Joe Allen and injured pair Phil Bardsley and Ryan Shawcross. Jon Walters and Mame Diouf joined Xherdan Shaqiri and Marko Arnautovic in a new-look Stoke attack, and Watford - whose only change saw Jose Holebas come in for Camilo Zuniga - struggled to deal with them in a one-sided first half. Gomes was forced into a triple save inside just seven minutes, with Diouf, Bruno Martins Indi and Shaqiri all seeing efforts beaten away. Gianni Imbula, who regained his place in the starting line-up, was the next to try, hitting a fierce strike from distance which drifted just high and wide of Gomes' goal. Kaboul limped off injured after just 19 minutes with substitute Christian Kabasele eventually replacing him after a significant period down to 10 men, and Stoke capitalised on the unsettled defence. Charlie Adam's header rebounded off Heurelho Gomes and into the Watford goal Adam somewhat dubiously shrugged off the challenge of Behrami in the six-yard box to meet a Shaqiri corner, which was pushed into the goal by Gomes after coming back off the post, handing Stoke the lead after 29 minutes. Little changed after half-time, with Arnautovic charging down the left-hand side minutes after the break and teasing a cross along the face of the goal which Walters could not quite reach with the goal gaping. Mazzarri brought on Odion Ighalo shortly after as he ditched his 3-4-3 formation which worked so effectively against Leicester City last weekend, but Watford struggled to create any clear-cut chances. Highlights of Stoke's 1-0 win away at Watford on Sunday Daryl Janmaat came closest for the Hornets in a second half of few chances, volleying just wide of Lee Grant's goal with 10 minutes left. As Watford pushed for an equaliser Stoke launched counter-attacks and Britos was dismissed for a cynical pull-back on the escaping Shaqiri having been booked in the first half for a late challenge on the same player. Hughes' Stoke closed out just their second away victory in the Premier League this season to send Mazzarri racing down the tunnel at full-time before shaking hands with his counterpart.

"Highlights: Arsenal 3-1 Bournemouth Highlights: Arsenal 3-1 Bournemouth An Alexis Sanchez double helped Arsenal earn a hard-fought 3-1 win against Bournemouth on Sunday in the Premier League. Arsenal went ahead early on after Sanchez capitalised on a poor Steve Cook backpass to slot home, before Callum Wilson equalised with a soft penalty after he was brought down by Nacho Monreal in the area. Theo Walcott regained Arsenal's lead eight minutes into the second half with a header after Monreal's fine cross, while Bournemouth had a strong penalty appeal turned down by Mike Jones after Monreal handled in the area. Theo Walcott celebrates putting Arsenal ahead in the second half Sanchez made sure of the points in stoppage time, finishing simply from six yards after substitute Olivier Giroud's centre. The result means Arsenal, who are unbeaten in 19 games, stay three points off leaders Chelsea, and break their winless run after three straight draws in all competitions. Arsene Wenger made seven changes from the side that drew 2-2 with Paris Saint-Germain on Wednesday night, dropping Olivier Giroud back to the bench, and starting Granit Xhaka, Theo Walcott and Mathieu Debuchy, who hadn't appeared for the club in over a year. During a frantic opening, Mesut Ozil saw his close-range effort blocked by the superb Nathan Ake, before Ake again blocked from Mohamed Elneny after a well-worked Arsenal free-kick. Walcott scored to make it 2-1 to Arsenal The hosts were ahead on 12 minutes, largely thanks to Bournemouth defender Cook, whose weak back-pass towards Adam Federici was pounced upon by Sanchez. The Chilean composed himself to apply a simple finish as the goal was left open by the Cook mishap. The injured Debuchy was replaced by Gabriel minutes later, as the half began to turn in Bournemouth's favour. They were awarded a penalty halfway through the first period after Wilson got goal-side of Monreal, though it did not look like the Arsenal defender made much of a move towards Wilson as the striker fell down in the area. Wilson stepped up to convert, much to the dismay of the Arsenal players and fans, who were furious with referee Jones. Callum Wilson scores Bournemouth's equaliser from the penalty spot Adam Smith then headed over the bar unmarked from eight yards after Ake's header across goal, before Petr Cech saved well at his near post from Brad Smith's effort. Arsenal finished the half on top, Sanchez smashing the ball against the bar from an acute angle on the right of the area, but Bournemouth deserved to be level at the break. Arsenal were ahead again on 53 minutes, as Monreal unselfishly centred for Walcott to head past Federici from eight yards, his sixth Premier League goal of the season.

United were again frustrated at home with a 1-1 draw against West Ham. Diafra Sakho gave the Hammers the lead after just two minutes when he headed in Dimitri Payet's free-kick. But United responded midway through the first half when Zlatan Ibrahimovic flicked past Darren Randolph from Paul Pogba's pass over the top. Pogba was booked for diving shortly afterwards, an incident that enraged Mourinho and saw him sent from the sidelines for kicking a water bottle in frustration. Jose Mourinho was sent to the stands during the draw It is the second time in the space of a month that Mourinho has been sent to the stands after his dismissal during the goalless draw against Burnley. And his mood was unlikely to have improved much as he watched his side held at home for the fourth successive match in the Premier League. As in recent games at Old Trafford, United created chances to take the lead, but they could not find a way past Randolph, who made several key stops. Ibrahimovic returned from suspension for the hosts while Bastian Schweinsteiger was named in the squad for the first time this season. With Winston Reid suspended for West Ham, James Collins started in defence, and Mark Noble returned to the side. Michail Antonio and Marcus Rashford tangle The Hammers made a dream start as, in the second minute, Payet fizzed a free-kick across goal and Sakho nodded in ahead of Ibrahimovic. The goal seemed to stun the home fans as well as the United players, who took a while to respond. Eventually, they started to take control and Ibrahimovic atoned for losing Sakho for the opening goal when he headed Pogba's perfectly-weighted pass beyond Randolph. Paul Pogba show his frustration during the draw at Old Trafford Pogba was involved in the action again in the 27th minute, receiving a yellow card for diving. The incident angered Mourinho, who kicked a water bottle into the air in frustration and was subsequently sent to the stands. But United finished the half strongly and started to create more chances. Jesse Lingard volleyed over from close range before Marcus Rashford, whose last goal was two months ago, failed to beat Randolph after being played through on goal. Ibrahimovic celebrates his equaliser Ibrahimovic then headed wide before seeing a shot stopped by a brilliant block by Angelo Obgonna. Randolph saved well from Lingard late in the half, but West Ham created chances of their own after the break, with David de Gea tipping over an audacious long-range free-kick from Payet and Sakho heading over from a corner. Wayne Rooney, who is one goal short of equalling Sir Bobby Charlton's scoring record for United, went close after coming off the bench but his low shot lacked the power to trouble Randolph. Bastian Schweinsteiger and Wayne Rooney were on the bench In a frantic finish, both sides created opportunities to take the lead. Randolph made a sharp stop to turn Henrikh Mkhitaryan's effort on to the post before the Hammers keeper palmed away a shot from Pogba that was heading for the bottom corner. Collins then played Randolph into trouble with a backwards header that was short, but Cheikhou Kouyate cleared before Ibrahimovic could turn into the empty net after his touch took him around the keeper. Ashley Fletcher, who left United for West Ham in the summer, almost snatched a winner for the visitors on the counter in the final few minutes, but was denied by De Gea from close range.

It took just 41 seconds for Southampton to take the lead as debutant Josh Sims crossed for Charlie Austin to head home from point-blank range. And it proved to be the only goal of the game as Southampton, who spurned a number of second-half chances, held on to end a run of four league games without a win. Victory moves Southampton into 10th and just two points behind Everton, who have won just one of their last eight league games, in seventh. Charlie Austin (L) celebrates scoring with Jose Fonte of Southampton (C) Southampton manager Claude Puel made seven changes from the side that lost 1-0 to Sparta Prague in the Europa League on Thursday and he handed the 19-year-old Sims his full first-team debut. Koeman, who managed Southampton for two years, recalled Gareth Barry in place of James McCarthy but his return to St Mary's started in the worst possible fashion. Sims was involved for the hosts, having an early shot blocked by Ashley Williams before a cross into the box fell at his feet and he lifted the ball onto the head of Austin, who headed home from close range to score his ninth goal of the season. Charlie Austin scores for Southampton Southampton - and Sims - were brimming with confidence and in the 16th minute the debutant found himself unmarked in the box, but his header was tame and straight at Maarten Stekelenburg. Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg lined up another effort for the hosts four minutes later but he fired the ball high over the crossbar and into the stands. Everton manager Ronald Koeman says Southampton started much better in his side’s 1-0 defeat and a goal so early made it very difficult. Everton manager Ronald Koeman says Southampton started much better in his side’s 1-0 defeat and a goal so early made it very difficult. Stekelenburg then collected Austin's weak effort before Everton created their first real opening, but Idrissa Gueye's shot flew over the crossbar after the midfielder was picked out by Seamus Coleman's cut-back. Everton had one final chance before the break as Gareth Barry won the ball from Sims before releasing Yannick Bolasie. The winger sent an early cross into the penalty area which was met by Ross Barkley, but his header flashed wide of the post. Josh Sims gets away from Gareth Barry In a similar pattern to the start of the first half, Southampton were better of the two sides after the break with Hojbjerg showing great footwork in the penalty area before smashing his effort against the outside of the post. Everton responded though with Aaron Lennon playing a clever one-two with Bolasie, who rifled a fierce effort narrowly wide of Fraser Forster's goal. Claude Puel says he was delighted with Josh Sims' debut for Southampton following their 1-0 win against Everton. Claude Puel says he was delighted with Josh Sims' debut for Southampton following their 1-0 win against Everton. The game was becoming stretched and in the 57th minute Cedric whipped an excellent cross into the box and Austin rose above everyone but his bullet header was clawed away by Stekelenburg. Koeman threw on Gerard Deulofeu for Lennon and Kevin Mirallas for Barkley as the visitors chased an equaliser but it was Southampton who nearly extended their advantage. Ronald Koeman and Claude Puel In the 76th minute Sims' fired a low effort across goal before James Ward-Prowse shot wide after being picked out by Austin. Ward-Prowse was involved again minutes later after being picked out by a brilliant cross from Cedric, but the midfielder's strike was palmed away by the goalkeeper. Sims was substituted six minutes from time, leaving the field to a standing ovation and he faced an anxious few minutes on the bench as Southampton looked to hold on. Coleman had a shot blocked while Mirallas pulled an effort wide as Everton made one final push for a point, but the hosts held on to get one over on their former boss.

The Clarets, for whom 37-year-old Paul Robinson started in goal in place of the injured Tom Heaton, took the lead in the 14th minute thanks to a brilliant volley from Dean Marney. But Aguero replied for City before the break and, after being denied by a superb save from Robinson, netted a scrappy winner on the hour mark after the hosts spurned several chances to clear their lines. The win temporarily moved City top of the table, but they slipped down to third after Liverpool beat Sunderland and Chelsea defeated Tottenham. City manager Pep Guardiola said beforehand that the match was \"key\", and the visitors managed to come away with all three points despite looking unconvincing at the back throughout. Perhaps some of that was due to the absence of centre-backs Vincent Kompany and John Stones, the former out injured and the latter rested. Sam Vokes tussles with Yaya Toure But they did have Aguero fit to start after an injury doubt, with Kevin de Bruyne and David Silva on the bench. Heaton had not missed a league game for Burnley since signing in 2013, but he was ruled out with a calf injury, so former England international Robinson made his debut and first Premier League appearance since 2012. Possibly feeling the effects of playing away in the Champions League on Wednesday, City started slowly. Sergio Aguero has now scored against 29 of the 30 different teams that he's faced in the Premier League, only failing to score against Bolton. Aside from an early Aguero shot that Robinson got down sharply to save, it was the Clarets who played with more purpose. They had strong penalty appeals waved away when Nicolas Otamendi barged into Jeff Hendrick from behind, but took the lead after 14 minutes when Marney brilliantly volleyed home from outside the box. City threatened a response as Nolito forced Robinson into a low save, Aguero shot off target and Yaya Toure then fired against the outside of the post. Dean Marney celebrates scoring the opening goal Eventually they equalised as a corner wasn't cleared and Aguero reacted quickest to slide in at the back post. Only a superb one-handed stop from Robinson minutes later prevented Aguero scoring a second. Burnley lost Marney and Johann Gudmonsson to injury before the break and they were on the back foot for the majority of the second half. City cranked up the pressure and eventually broke through on the hour mark, albeit in slightly fortuitous circumstances. Burnley had several chances to clear their lines, with Ben Mee even taking out Stephen Ward as he tried to clear the ball away, before Fernandinho squared for Aguero to turn in off his knee. City continued to press and control the game but their inability to finish it off could have cost them as Burnley posed problems with balls into the box. Michael Keane saw a goalbound header blocked before George Boyd and Hendrick were closed down quickly as they went to shoot.

Gareth McAuley headed home a Matty Phillips corner (34) as the Baggies dominated the opening half and looked destined to add to recent victories over Leicester and Burnley. But an improved performance in the second half from the hosts finally yielded a point when Dawson poked home via the inside of the near post (72) after Robert Snodgrass' free-kick was knocked down to his feet. The draw was not enough to lift Hull out of the bottom three, instead moving them level on points with West Ham and Crystal Palace, but it made sure they avoided a seventh defeat in nine matches. Mike Phelan's unchanged side looked to be heading for that outcome as the confident Baggies bossed the first half, with James Morrison firing early shots at goal and Darren Fletcher sending a header over the crossbar. Michael Dawson's 72nd minute goal cancelled our Gareth McAuley's opener West Brom's full-backs Allan Nyom and Craig Dawson had great joy down each flank but could not provide the quality delivery needed to make the breakthrough. That task came down to Phillips, whose pacey corner set McAuley up to guide his header down into the net beneath stumbling Hull City defenders. Phelan introduced Adama Diomande for the second half and his injection of direct running buoyed the side, and the midfielder forced Ben Foster into his first save of the game on 50 minutes. Gareth McAuley headed home a Matty Phillips corner in the first half Jake Livermore than had two excellent chances to level, the second capping off a wonderful one-touch move that incorporated six Hull players, but ended with an easy stop for Foster. Foster saved another shot from Snodgrass as Hull piled on the pressure, and the Scotland forward's endeavour was rewarded when his free-kick was knocked down by Dieumerci Mbokani and fell to Dawson to poke home. Pulis introduced the returning Nacer Chadli with 10 minutes left, and he, fellow substitute Hal Robson-Kanu and Solomon Rondon all had chances to grab a late winner. Chadli curled a great free-kick towards the top-near corner that was palmed away by David Marshall before close-range headers for Robson-Kanu and Rondon, both from James McClean crosses, failed to find the target.

Saturday. It had been Alvaro Negredo's afternoon as he got his first goals since the opening day of the season to twice see Boro ahead, putting the visitors in front in the 13th minute as he chipped a delightful effort over the Foxes defence. Riyad Mahrez got Leicester level from the penalty spot just after the half-hour mark following a Calum Chambers handball but Negredo once again found the net with just under 20 minutes to play. Leicester City's Islam Slimani (2nd R) celebrates after scoring a late penalty But the Premier League champions were to have the final say as Marten de Roon fouled Wes Morgan in the box to see referee Lee Mason point to the spot for a second time, and Slimani stepped up to seal a last-gasp draw for the hosts. Leicester now move up to 13th - two points above the relegation zone - while Middlesbrough sit in 15th just one point ahead of the bottom three. Boro started as the stronger side and drew a fine save from Ron-Robert Zieler after ten minutes following a brilliant run from Adama Traore on the right flank. He saw his cross palmed into the path of Adam Forshaw, who in turn found De Roon at the top of the box - but he fizzed wide. Alvaro Negredo's two goals weren't enough to see Boro take the win Three minutes later, Negredo got his first Middlesbrough goal in 977 minutes of action. He set off the move in the middle of the park, finding Gaston Ramirez on the left flank who surged forward, before crossing back in for the striker who delightfully chipped the ball over the Foxes defence and into the back of the net. Leicester started to find their flow on the half hour mark as Mahrez showed off the best of his skills to get away from Fabio on the right-hand side, dancing in the box before his cross found Shinji Okazaki to his left. The Japan forward hit a delightful overhead kick but his effort rattled the crossbar and went wide. Adam Clayton (L) and Shinji Okazaki battle for the ball The Foxes found the breakthrough in the 34th minute as Mason pointed to the spot after a handball from Chambers in the area. It was Mahrez who stepped up to take, hitting home via the upright to get Leicester back level. Jamie Vardy had failed to score in 14 matches for the Foxes ahead of Saturday's game, and went agonisingly close to breaking his drought with two minutes of the half to play. Okazaki latched onto a scrappy knock down from Mahrez and fired a cross for the striker, which he duly sent goalwards but a slight nick from an incoming Ramirez saw it poke just past the upright. Mahrez converts from the spot to equalise for Leicester Chances were mostly at a premium during the second half, with the first eye of goal coming in the 63rd minute as a Danny Simpson cross found Andy King in the middle of the box but his header just popped over the bar, prompting Claudio Ranieri to take off Vardy and Mahrez and replace them with Slimani and Ahmed Musa. The two had an instant impact and Leicester looked to be getting on the front foot, linking up to set up Okazaki for a fine effort from the top of the box - which was well saved by Victor Valdes - before a Musa shot just skimmed the crossbar. Negredo battles with Daniel Amartey in the middle of the park But Negredo was on target once again in the 71st minute during the Foxes resurgence as a fine ball over the top from Forshaw saw him run into the box between Robert Huth and Christian Fuchs, having plenty of space and time to set himself up before firing past Zieler to put Boro back ahead. Leicester were threatening to equalise as the minutes ticked down, as Daniel Amartey hit a firecracker of an effort just over the bar before King headed into the path of Musa but he also scuffed an effort in front of the goal mouth. Negredo scores the opening goal for Middlesbrough In the final seconds of the three added on, De Roon tripped Morgan on the edge of the box, which saw Mason point to the spot for a second time in Leicester's favour. Slimani was the man to step up and send the ball past Valdes to grab a point for the Foxes.

Origi, who came on as a first-half substitute, squeezed the ball home from the edge of the area to break the deadlock with just 15 minutes remaining, before Milner netted a stoppage-time penalty to wrap up the points. In an uneventful, goalless first period, there was a worry for Liverpool as in-form Philippe Coutinho was brought off on a stretcher with a foot injury. Roberto Firmino attempts to get a shot on goal in the first half The result meant Liverpool went top of the Premier League briefly on Saturday afternoon, before Chelsea returned to the summit with a 2-1 win over Tottenham at Stamford Bridge. Liverpool were unchanged for the first time in 40 Premier League games under Jurgen Klopp, but his side struggled to create clear-cut chances in the first half. It was Sunderland who had the best chance of the half, with Steven Pienaar failing to capitalise on a mix-up in the Liverpool defence, seeing his close-range effort blocked by Loris Karius. Liverpool's Philippe Coutinho is carried off after being injured There was a big concern for the Reds as Coutinho was taken off on a stretcher with an injury to his right foot after kicking the boot of Lamine Kone. Dejan Lovren had Liverpool's best chance of the first period, heading wide unmarked at the far post from Jordan Henderson's free-kick, before Jordan Pickford saved well down low from Sadio Mane's shot on the turn. Georginio Wijnaldum's mis-hit volley was inches away from Milner's boot after the break, before Jordan Pickford did superbly to block Roberto Firmino's low effort at the near post. Coutinho looked in pain as he clashed with Lamine Kone There was a bizarre moment on the sidelines as Liverpool struggled to break down Sunderland, with Reds manager Klopp berating his own fans for groaning at his side, forcefully gesturing for them to turn their frustration into encouragement. It nearly worked instantly, but Emre Can's half-volley fell inches wide of the right-hand post, before Duncan Watmore's heavy touch allowed Karius to block the ball at his feet after he had been put through on goal by Victor Anichebe. Liverpool finally broke the deadlock on 75 minutes through Origi, who shaped to cross from an acute angle on the edge of the area, but instead found the far corner of Pickford's goal with a superb effort. Liverpool's James Milner celebrates scoring his side's second goal from the penalty spot The Reds, who had 78 per cent possession at Anfield, got a second in injury time as Didier Ndong hacked down Mane as he raced into the area. Milner stepped up and made no mistake, sending Pickford the wrong way, and secured a vital three points for Klopp's men in their bid for the Premier League title.

5-4 victory over Crystal Palace. Wilfried Zaha had put Palace ahead at the Liberty Stadium before Gylfi Sigurdsson's sensational free-kick sent the teams in level at half-time. Leroy Fer scored two goals in three minutes after the break to put Swansea clear of their opponents, before James Tomkins and a Jack Cork own-goal brought Palace back to 3-3. Christian Benteke looked to have won it in the 84th minute Christian Benteke looked to have won it for Palace in the 84th minute after turning in Scott Dann's header, but substitute Llorente poked in two goals in added time to condemn Palace to their sixth Premier League defeat in a row. Connor Wickham earned a place in Alan Pardew's starting line-up in place of Andros Townsend after coming on for the winger at half time to score against Manchester City last weekend. Swansea remained unchanged from their 1-1 draw with Everton, with Sigurdsson again leading the line and summer signing Llorente left on the bench. Gylfi Sigurdsson equalised for Swansea with a spectacular free-kick Switching to a 4-4-2 paid dividends early on for Palace, with Wickham and Benteke both proving too powerful in the air for the Swansea centre-backs. But Belgium international Benteke squandered a chance to put Palace ahead less than seven minutes in, firing over from close range after Dann's header caused a goal-mouth scramble. Palace's aerial dominance paid off after just 19 minutes though, with Benteke rising to beat Federico Fernandez in a frequent mismatch and finding Zaha. The winger still had to turn to beat Taylor though, before firing low past Lukasz Fabianski to put Pardew's side ahead. The away side were in control right up until the 36th minute, when Jason Puncheon foolishly pushed Cork on the edge of the area, giving Sigurdsson an opportunity to take centre-stage, and the Iceland international struck a sweet free-kick into the top left-hand corner to draw level. Wilfried Zaha put Palace in front after a strong opening Zaha almost put Palace back in front straight away, heading against the crossbar after Yohan Cabaye had found him at the back post. The game turned when Wickham suffered what looked a serious injury early in the second half and was replaced by Townsend. With Palace forced to switch from their 4-4-2 formation, the Swans took control. Bradley acted quickly to bring on Llorente before a Swansea corner and the Spaniard's resulting header from the set-piece bounced off Cabaye on the line and was poked back in by Fer to put Swansea ahead. Swansea City manager Bob Bradley reacts to his side's dramatic win over Crystal Palace Swansea City manager Bob Bradley reacts to his side's dramatic win over Crystal Palace Fer then scored his second goal in three minutes after a free-kick deflected off Palace and Swansea players before finally glancing off Llorente and in off Fer's toe. But Palace struck back in the 75th minute when another goal-mouth scramble finished with Tomkins scoring from close range, before Zaha's cross took a wicked deflection off Cork and looped over Fabianski to make it three apiece. Pardew looked to have his first win since September 24 when Benteke then reacted quickest in the six-yard box to turn Dann's header towards goal and make it 4-3 with just six minutes of normal time remaining. Alan Pardew says his Crystal Palace side defended poorly and he’ll have to make changes Alan Pardew says his Crystal Palace side defended poorly and he’ll have to make changes However, after Llorente's header was saved brilliantly by Hennessey, the former Juventus striker deflected in Sigurdsson's rebound to bring it level in the 91st minute. And when Palace failed to clear a hopeful free-kick into the box, Llorente was there to tap in for Swansea's first league win since the opening Premier League weekend, lifting them off the bottom of the table and just two points behind Palace in 16th.

"report": "Watch highlights of Chelsea's win over Tottenham at Stamford Bridge Watch highlights of Chelsea's win over Tottenham at Stamford Bridge Chelsea kept hold of top spot in the Premier League after coming from behind to beat Tottenham Hotspur 2-1 at Stamford Bridge on Saturday evening, ending the visitors' unbeaten run in the process. Mauricio Pochettino's side opened the scoring after only 11 minutes thanks to Christian Eriksen's brilliant long-ranger - the first goal Chelsea had conceded in over 10 hours - only for Pedro to level just before half-time with his own sensational strike. The home team claimed all three points when Victor Moses - making his seventh consecutive league start - slotted home after 51 minutes as they made it seven league wins in a row, their best run for six years. As a result, Chelsea remain a point clear of second-placed Liverpool and third-in-the-table Manchester City, who both also won earlier in the day, while Spurs stay fifth and are now seven points behind their London rivals. As expected, Blues boss Antonio Conte named an unchanged starting line-up for the sixth successive top-flight match, although captain John Terry was ruled out with a muscular injury. Chelsea players celebrate after Victor Moses scored their second goal against Tottenham Tottenham were without full-backs Danny Rose and Ben Davies through suspension and injury respectively - with Kevin Wimmer surprisingly filling in for the former at left back - while both Erik Lamela and Toby Alderweireld missed out with injury. However, it was the visitors who made the more accomplished start to the contest, dominating both possession and territory in the opening exchanges, culminating in Eriksen's wonderful opener. Pedro scores his side's equaliser just before the break Referee Michael Oliver deserves praise for his part in the goal, with the official playing an excellent advantage in the immediate lead-up to the Dane's strike after a foul on Son Heung-min. The ball broke kindly to Eriksen towards the left-hand edge of the area, with the playmaker then beating Thibaut Courtois with a well-struck left-footed effort for his first goal of the season after his 39th attempt of the campaign. And if anything in the first period, it looked as though it was Chelsea, rather than Spurs, who had had a tough Champions League exertion on the road in midweek. Tottenham Hotspur's midfielder Christian Eriksen (L) celebrates scoring the opening goal against Chelsea However, the Blues gradually worked their way into proceedings and drew level in the final minute of the half through a sublime strike from Pedro, who picked the ball up on the edge of the area and after an exquisite Cruyff turn, the winger beat Hugo Lloris with an inch-perfect curler into the top right-hand corner of the net. That goal could not have come at a better time for Conte's side, who marched off at the break in high spirits, and they maintained that spring in their step in the second half as Spurs wilted. Chelsea midfielder Pedro (centre) is congratulated after equalising for Chelsea In fact, it took Chelsea only six minutes of the second half to go in front for the first time, with Diego Costa playing an integral role as the muscular Brazil-born striker broke clear to the left-hand byline, before pulling the ball back for the unmarked Moses to score, despite Jan Vertonghen's presence on the line. Thereafter, Chelsea controlled the temp of the match as Tottenham's trip to the South of France on Tuesday appeared to finally catch up with them, with Marcos Alonso missing a great chance to kill off their rivals after side-footing over from close range minutes after Moses's strike. That miss, though, was not to prove costly as Chelsea easily held on to their lead in the final quarter of the game as the visitors' 26-year wait for a league win at the Bridge continues.

their biggest Premier League win in more than two years as they defeated Burnley 4-0. After scoring his first goal for the club in their 2-1 victory at Leicester in their previous outing, Matt Phillips notched his second just four minutes into the contest at The Hawthorns. His fellow Scotland internationals James Morrison and Darren Fletcher also struck before half-time to kill the match as a contest. The excellent Salomon Rondon then got a fourth as Albion matched their 4-0 scoreline from September 2014, also against Burnley, to move up into ninth place. Both sides went into the fixture off the back of valuable wins in their previous outings but it was West Brom who built on theirs. James Morrison of West Brom (left) celebrates with Salomon Rondon Phillips had been the matchwinner at the King Power Stadium and continued from where he left off - albeit his opener was a gift from the visitors. Chris Brunt released Morrison down the right and his cross was intercepted by Dean Marney, but he succeeded only in playing the loose ball to the former QPR forward. Phillips then took a touch to control before turning round and firing high into the net from close range to give the hosts an advantage they never looked like losing. Rondon scores West Brom's fourth goal Burnley tried to respond but Scott Arfield's volley from a tight angle was tame, Steven Defour's shot was blocked and Jeff Hendrick lifted just wide of the post. West Brom made them pay for their misses in ruthless fashion as they poured forward and Rondon showed great upper body strength to hold off Michael Keane and set up their second. He played Morrison clear and the midfielder waited before picking his spot low past Heaton with a really smart, curled finish. Phillips puts West Brom 1-0 up against Burnley It suddenly seemed such a long way back for Burnley and even Heaton made an uncharacteristic mistake as he passed to Morrison only to feel relief as he screwed high and wide. A third was coming, however, and after Rondon drilled a fierce volley just over after being supplied by Allan Nyom, it was Fletcher who got it. Phillips was the creator on the left, bursting away from Matt Lowton before crossing to the back post and finding the former Manchester United player, who bundled in his first of the campaign. Phillips holds off Michael Keane at The Hawthorns Burnley's reply was meek after the break and it was fitting the final goal of the night went to Rondon. One of the most improved forwards in the Premier League, his all-round play had been terrific and although his strike went in via a deflection, it was richly deserved. Phillips and Morrison combined on the left to feed Nyom and his cut-back found Rondon, who controlled then steered in off Ben Mee. Rondon was impressed with his side during their 4-0 win Rondon was impressed with his side during their 4-0 win There were chances for a fifth as West Brom finished strongly on a night when a Tony Pulis team scored four times in a Premier League match for just the third time. Brunt's long-range volley went past, Hal Robson-Kanu almost poked in a wicked cross from the Northern Irishman and Heaton tipped an attempt from Craig Gardner wide.

Man of the match Victor Moses and Chelsea team-mate Gary Cahill give their reaction Man of the match Victor Moses and Chelsea team-mate Gary Cahill give their reaction The victory sends Chelsea a point clear of Manchester City and Liverpool at the top of the table, and means they end a weekend at the summit for the first time since they were champions in the 2014/15 season. While it was not as emphatic as the Blues' 5-0 drubbing of Everton, it was another resolute defensive display as they restricted Boro to few clear openings. Costa celebrates with Chelsea manager Antonio Conte For the first time in the Premier League, Chelsea named the same starting line-up for a fifth game in a row, with Costa and Eden Hazard fit to start despite doubts after returning from international duty. George Friend missed out for Boro with injury so Fabio made his first league appearance, while Gaston Ramirez came in for Stewart Downing. Middlesbrough have now lost their last six Premier League games against Chelsea, failing to score in each match. Boro had held Arsenal and Manchester City to draws before the international break and they showed their resilience in the early stages while also threatening down the flanks. The only half chances for Chelsea saw Victor Moses slash a shot wide and Marcos Alonso miss the target with an effort from distance. Middlesbrough's Adama Traore gets a shot off But the Blues did step it up as the half wore on and Victor Valdes pulled off a fine save to deny Pedro from Moses' cut-back. Alvaro Negredo headed over at the other end in a rare opening for the hosts. The breakthrough arrived in the 41st minute as a corner was deflected up into the air and Costa was the first to react to volley into the net. Antonio Conte was happy with his Chelsea side's 1-0 win but insisted his team must be more ruthless in front of goal Antonio Conte was happy with his Chelsea side's 1-0 win but insisted his team must be more ruthless in front of goal Chelsea continued to control the game after half-time and Alonso saw a low shot saved by Valdes. Boro spurned an opening when Ramirez missed the target from the edge of the area, before Chelsea created a couple of clear chances in quick succession. Eden Hazard challenges Antonio Barragan First, Pedro fired against the underside of the bar from Costa's knock down, before Moses shot over after being slipped through on goal. The misses kept Boro in the game but they only once tested Thibaut Courtois as Negredo controlled well and then saw a shot tipped around the post.

Arsene Wenger has had little to cheer against Jose Mourinho in the Premier League but his decision to throw on Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Giroud late on proved inspired as they combined for the leveller after Juan Mata's opener. The late salvo stretched Arsenal's unbeaten run in all competitions to 17 games, although Wenger has still yet to beat Mourinho in the league in 12 meetings and his team only mustered one shot on target in the game. Jose Mourinho hailed Man Utd's 'phenomenal' defensive display Jose Mourinho hailed Man Utd's 'phenomenal' defensive display The result means more problems for United, who have picked up just six points from their last five Premier League games at Old Trafford. They remain six points off the Gunners, who have moved up to third. In the absence of the suspended Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Mourinho, who engaged in a frosty pre-match handshake with Wenger, decided to start Marcus Rashford in attack and leave Wayne Rooney on the bench. Jose Mourinho and Arsene Wenger shake hands It was one of four changes from the victory over Swansea last time out, as Antonio Valencia surprisingly returned from a broken arm to replace Ashley Young at right-back. The big news for Arsenal was that Alexis Sanchez was fit to start following a hamstring niggle picked up on international duty with Chile. Carl Jenkinson made a rare Premier League start at right-back, deputising for the injured Hector Bellerin. Wayne Rooney (C) was left on the bench United looked under strict orders to press Arsenal high up the pitch from the off. It yielded plenty of early pressure but little way of clear cut chances. Rashford and Pogba twice powered into space down the right flank but on both occasions their fine crosses were won by an Arsenal shirt. Theo Walcott says Arsenal worked hard to earn a point Theo Walcott says Arsenal worked hard to earn a point Despite their high-tempo beginning, it was Arsenal that should've opened the scoring on seven minutes when Nacho Monreal's cross was flicked on by Theo Walcott but Sanchez made a mess of the header from six yards. Matteo Darmian, who was booked for a foul on Walcott on 25 minutes, was perhaps lucky not to receive his marching orders eight minutes later when going in late on Jenkisnon. Referee Andre Marriner felt one last warning was sufficient punishment. Manchester United defender Phil Jones (L) vies with Arsenal's Aaron Ramsey The man in the middle was called into action again on 35 minutes when he waved away a penalty appeal as the rampaging Valencia took a tumble after a coming together with Monreal. Mourinho was visibly seething on the touchline. Mourinho shows his frustration after Manchester United are denied a penalty The first shot on target in the game came on 37 minutes as Petr Cech got down smartly to push away a Mata effort after he had turned away from Shkodran Mustafi. The pace of the game dropped after the break with Arsenal, who have the best away defensive record in the league, happy to sit in a organised shape and soak up United's dominance of the ball. Arsene Wenger hailed Arsenal's response after going 1-0 down Arsene Wenger hailed Arsenal's response after going 1-0 down Mourinho tried to inject some life into his team's lethargic build-up play by sending on Rooney on 63 minutes. The extra man in a forward area created more space for the United attackers and they took the lead five minutes later. Paul Pogba and Ander Herrera linked well down the right flank and the latter's cross into the area was clinically dispatched from 12 yards by Mata - his fifth league goal against the Gunners. Juan Mata celebrates scoring the opening goal of the game Arsenal's response was non-existent, until they burst forward on 89 minutes to net an unlikely equaliser. Oxlade-Chamberlain, who had been only on the pitch for four minutes, sent in a cross from the right and fellow substitute Giroud rose highest to power a brilliant header into the net.

Gylfi Sigurdsson converted his penalty in the first half to give Swansea the lead While Everton welcomed back Leighton Baines and James McCarthy to the starting line-up, Bradley made eight changes to his Swansea side that lost to Manchester United a fortnight ago.

Everton were slow to get going but then carved out two glorious opportunities to take the lead. Firstly, a powerful Yannick Bolasie cross ricocheted off Romelu Lukaku's thigh in the six-yard box and sailed over the bar when it could have gone anywhere. Everton manager Ronald Koeman (L) had to settle for a point at home Moments later, Ross Barkley started and finished a fine Everton move, but shot wide on the turn following Bolasie's pinpoint cross. Five minutes before the break, Barrow picked out Sigurdsson in the box, who flicked it past Jagielka before the Everton defender bundled the forward over as he was getting a shot away. Jagielka received a yellow, while Sigurdsson picked himself up to take the spot-kick, sending Stekelenburg the wrong way with a fine penalty into the top corner.

After the break, Everton enjoyed more of the ball, but in truth, they created better chances in the first half. Swansea did have the chance to go two goals clear just after the hour-mark, but Jay Fulton glanced his header wide from Sigurdsson's cross. A resolute Swansea defence appeared to be guiding their side to victory, but Everton had the final say in the last minute of normal time. Ashley Williams (L) was playing against his former club Ashley Williams, who was facing his old club for the first time since a £12m summer move, sent in a cross which was cleared out to Bolasie.

The scoreline was perhaps a little harsh on Hull but the result means David Moyes' men have now won back-to-back games to move off the bottom of the Premier League table. The game was held up for 10 minutes in the second half by a floodlight failure but the Black Cats produced a bright performance in a game labelled a 'six-pointer' by their manager in its build-up.

The 34-year-old appeared to have more time and space than any other player on the pitch as he beat two defenders before firing a left-footed shot into the far corner. It was as confident and clinical a strike as any of the 149 Premier League goals he has scored prior to it, and was his seventh - out of Sunderland's 10 - for the season. The match was held up for 10 minutes due to a second-half floodlight failure It appeared for a long period of the game that the afternoon would belong to Defoe, even when the floodlights went out during which time Moyes looked extremely concerned that three precious points were about to be spirited away by a technical malfunction. But Anichebe added a second on 62 minutes to deliver a hammer blow to Hull's momentum in the game and then stamped a seal on it with six minutes left to play, both efforts beating David Marshall at his near post.

All the goals came in the first quarter of an hour at Vicarage Road, with Etienne Capoue scoring the opener after just 32 seconds. Pereyra curled in the home side's second with 12 minutes on the clock and although the visitors replied quickly through Riyad Mahrez's penalty, they could not get back on level terms. The result sees Watford keep up their promising start to their Premier League campaign under Walter Mazzarri but Leicester continue to hover just above the relegation zone. All the key moments in this fixture came in a frantic opening sequence, with Pereyra the architect of the goal which put Watford ahead. His persistence down the left when he seemed to be going down a blind alley but he managed to wriggle away from two men and cut inside before crossing into the box. Etienne Capoue fires Watford ahead against Leicester His deliverywas flicked on by Troy Deeney and the ball fell to Capoue who volleyed into the net for his fifth strike of the season. Leicester's response was meek at first and Watford took advantage of that to double their advantage. Watford's Younes Kaboul of Watford (L) tackles Marc Albrighton of Leicester Pereyra again picked the ball up on the left but this time stepped in to give himself a better angle and curled a lovely effort beyond Ron-Robert Zieler from just inside the area. Leicester made a game of it, however, and within three minutes they had a chance to get back into the game as a penalty was awarded following Miguel Britos' clumsy trip on Jamie Vardy. Watford 2-1 Leicester Watford 2-1 Leicester Riyad Mahrez took the kick and sent it right down the middle into the net, suddenly making what had been a commanding Watford lead look like a vulnerable one. Indeed, Younes Kaboul had to look sprightly to intercept a lovely teasing cross from Danny Drinkwater and Robert Huth should have done better than head over the bar. In response, Nordin Amrabat was a useful outlet for the hosts and his pace and direct approach restricted any kind of progress Leicester looked like making. Watford should have been 3-1 up before the break when Deeney, chasing his 100th goal for the club, was released down the right channel. Riyad Mahrez pulls a goal back for Leicester against Watford Once again, he was unselfish as he picked out the better-placed Amrabat - only for the Dutchman to totally miscue when he had clear sight of goal with only Zieler to beat. By comparison, the second period was a poor follow up to the first and the game became increasingly scrappy as Leicester became more desperate for a leveller. That said, Watford could again have netted a third but wasted a good chance when Zieler got across to Pereyra. Reaction from Walter Mazzarri following the 2-1 win over Leicester. Reaction from Walter Mazzarri following the 2-1 win over Leicester. At first it looked to be an outstanding save after Daryl Janmaat's hanging cross but in reality Pereyra should have finished comfortably and headed straight to where the keeper was heading instead. In the closing stages, Leicester had plenty of possession and hemmed Watford back but still found it hard to make clear openings. Huth was blocked superbly by Britos while Wes Morgan and Ahmed Musa were also kept out by stern defending. Claudio Ranieri threw on Jeff Schlupp for the closing moments and his pace made an impact as he burst past two men and found fellow substitute Musa.

Tottenham 3-2 West Ham A Harry Kane double snatched a dramatic late win for Tottenham as they beat West Ham 3-2 on Saturday evening to maintain their unbeaten run in the Premier League. The Hammers had looked to be heading for victory after another Michail Antonio header saw them go ahead in the first half, but Spurs got themselves level six minutes after the break as Harry Winks netted on his first league start. The visitors retook the lead in the 67th minute when Manuel Lanzini converted from the spot, but Kane again got Spurs on equal terms, tapping home with one minute of normal time to play, before converting a penalty in the first minute of time added on to seal a remarkable win for the hosts. West Ham's dismal evening was rounded off after Winston Reid was sent off in the final action of the game to see the Hammers sit one point above the relegation places, while Spurs move up to fifth - one point behind Arsenal. Harry Winks netted on his first Premier League start for Tottenham Tottenham just edged the opening exchanges with Winks particularly impressive and he nearly scored inside the opening three minutes, but could only fire wide from the edge of the box. Christian Eriksen then had the ball in the net not long after following a delightful through ball from Eric Dier but he was flagged marginally offside, before Kane also flashed a shot past the post from 10 yards. Michail Antonio scores the opener for West Ham But West Ham started to see their own sights of goal as the clock ticked to the quarter hour mark, and Antonio was at the heat of the action. After playing a one-two with Andre Ayew from a throw-in, the winger went on a mazy run to the top of the box - easily getting past Victor Wanyama on his way - but his curled effort just skimmed the top left corner of the upright. He made the breakthrough nine minutes later though, netting his 11th headed Premier League goal of 2016. Dimitri Payet's corner initially found Cheikhou Kouyate - who rifled his effort against the crossbar - but the rebound fell to the feet of Reid, who floated a cross towards the back post which was powerfully headed home by Antonio. Winks of Tottenham (L) is put under pressure from West Ham's Antonio Tottenham could have levelled with three minutes of the half to play as Kane and Rose played a delightful give-and-go, before the defender flashed a cross in front of goal but the incoming Eriksen could not get there to tap home. But the hosts did find their equaliser six minutes into the second half after some brilliant Spurs build-up. Rose slipped in Vincent Janssen on the left, before hammering a shot at Darren Randolph but the parry fell into the path of Winks, who slotted home from close range. Manuel Lanzini converted from the spot to put West Ham back in front Referee Mike Dean pointed to the spot in West Ham's favour in the 67th minute after Janssen pulled down Reid in the box froma a Payet corner. Lanzini made no mistake in expertly dispatching the spot-kick to see the visitors back ahead. They looked to be on their way to a vital three points, but the game was turned on its head in the 89th minute as Kane scored the first of his two goals to spark the Spurs comeback. Substitute Heung-Min Son fired in a cross from the left - evading a number of West Ham players - before a glancing fingertip save from Randoplh saw the ball into the England striker's path who slotted home for the equaliser. Less than two minutes later, Mike Dean awarded another penalty - this time in favour of Tottenham - after Harvard Nordtveit tripped Son in the area. Kane made no mistake from the spot to spark rapturous scenes inside White Hart Lane. Harry Winks celebrates scoring his side's first goal It did not get any better for West Ham as captain Reid was booked twice within three minutes of added time to be given his marching orders and will now miss next weekend's league trip to Manchester United. As for Tottenham, they are yet to lose in the Premier League this season - a run of 12 games - and are in Champions League action on Tuesday evening against Monaco before a third successive London derby in the league, this time away at Chelsea on Saturday.

returned from injury to earn Tottenham a 1-1 draw against Arsenal in the Premier League on Sunday. After Theo Walcott had hit the post with a superb effort, Arsenal took the lead through Kevin Wimmer's own goal just before the break, the defender heading past Hugo Lloris from Mesut Ozil's cross. Back in the side after a seven-week absence, Kane's penalty levelled it up for Spurs after the break, following Laurent Koscielny's foul on Mousa Dembele. Arsenal players celebrate after Kevin Wimmer's own goal at the Emirates The result means Tottenham are still the only unbeaten side left in the Premier League, but stay three points behind Arsenal. Kane started for Spurs after being out with an ankle ligament injury, but Dele Alli missed out having picked up a knee problem in training on Saturday. The England international nearly returned with a bang after 21 minutes, steering a diving header from Christian Eriksen's cross just wide of Petr Cech's right-hand post. Wimmer heads past Hugo Lloris before half-time Arsenal woke up as the first half wore on, and Alex Iwobi should have done better when put through by Alexis Sanchez, but his low effort was collected by Lloris. Walcott was denied a stunning opener as his fierce effort from just outside the area bounced off the woodwork, before Ozil blazed the rebound over the bar on the half volley. Arsenal took the lead three minutes before half-time as Ozil's free-kick was diverted by Wimmer's head into his own goal, though the replays showed that Sanchez, who did not touch the ball but was arguably involved in play, was offside from the German's cross. Tottenham Hotspur's Kyle Walker and Arsenal's Alex Iwobi battle for the ball in the air Spurs improved after the break, and levelled from the spot through Kane after Koscielny had brought down Dembele following a fine run from the Belgian. Kane stepped up, slotted the ball down the middle of the goal, and celebrated his fifth goal in a north London derby, and his 14 in 14 games against other clubs from the capital. Petr Cech kept the scores level just five minutes later, superbly diverting Eriksen's firm left-footed effort from 12 yards wide of the post, before Kane failed to divert at the far post after Danny Rose had picked him out. Laurent Koscielny challenges Kane in the first period The unmarked Granit Xhaka was then inches away from converting a Sanchez cross, while Eric Dier did superbly to block Hector Bellerin's shot from close range. Eriksen hit the post with six minutes remaining after a deep cross from the left byline went through the crowd in the penalty area, and in the 90th minute substitute Olivier Giroud failed to test Lloris with an unmarked header. Spurs are now without a win at the Emirates since November 2010, while four of the last five north London derbies in the Premier League have ended in a draw.

"report": "Hull 2-1 Southampton Hull 2-1 Southampton Hull City came from behind to beat Southampton 2-1 at the KCOM Stadium on Sunday afternoon after scoring twice in the space of just 125 seconds in the second half. The Tigers, who were booed off at half-time, trailed at the break to Charlie Austin's sixth-minute penalty. However, Hull turned the game on its head after the interval to claim all three points thanks to quick-fire strikes from substitute Robert Snodgrass and captain Michael Dawson. Hull City captain Michael Dawson celebrates after scoring his side's winner against Hull City Despite ending a run of six straight Premier League defeats, Mike Phelan's side remain in the relegation zone, while the Saints are in a mid-table position. Hull were able to welcome back Dieumerci Mbokani and Snodgrass after hamstring and ankle injuries respectively, with both players fit enough to take their places on the substitutes' bench. The visitors, meanwhile, recalled key trio Jose Fonte, Austin and Steven Davis, who all sat out Thursday's 2-1 home win against Inter Milan in the Europa League. And it was Southampton who made the perfect start to the game after earning a penalty just six minutes in following a rash tackle by Hull centre-back Curtis Davies on Maya Yoshida, with referee Graham Scott having no hesitation in awarding a penalty. Southampton's in-form striker Austin kept his cool from the spot by sending David Marshall the wrong way, with the ball nestling in the bottom left-hand corner of the net for the 27-year-old's eight goal in all competitions this season. Southampton striker Charlie Austin celebrates after opening the scoring at the KCOM Stadium The home team's afternoon then went from bad to worse as only four minutes later they lost big-money forward Abel Hernandez to injury, before fellow frontman Will Keane fell victim to a nasty-looking knee problem midway through the first half. But after Southampton - who could have seen Dusan Tadic sent off for a high tackle on Rayan Mason in the first half -central defender Virgil Van Dijk had struck the bar with a header six minutes after the break, the visitors' midweek exertions in Europe appeared to catch up with them, with Hull taking full advantage. Firstly Harry Maguire missed a great chance to pull his team level, with the defender failing to hit the target from close range after being picked out by Snodgrass' inch-perfect free kick. Hull City forward Abel Hernandez had to leave the field with injury However, that was soon forgotten as just a minute later the Tigers were level after Sam Clucas made his way to the left-hand byline, before pulling the ball back perfectly for Snodgrass - on for the injured Keane - to rifle home from 10 yards out. Incredibly, barely had anyone in the stadium been able to catch thweir breath before Hull found themselves in front in the game, and again that man Snodgrass was involved. The Scotland international, who has a wand of a left foot, swung a free kick straight on to the head of Dawson, with the central defender rising highest to power a header high into the net past a helpless Fraser Forster. Charlie Austin (left) is congratulated by his Southampton team-mates after giving his side a sixth-minute lead Southampton tried manfully in the closing stages to rescue a point, with Austin being denied by Marshall and then a last-gasp Dawson block, before Clucas found himself in the right place to clear one final effort off the line in stoppage time.

The Reds were rampant in front of their own fans and broke the deadlock after a series of near misses in the 27th minute when Sadio Mane headed home. Philippe Coutinho doubled the hosts' lead moments later before Emre Can made it 3-0 shortly before half-time. After the break, Roberto Firmino tapped home the fourth in the 57th minute and Mane netted his second on the hour-mark before Daryl Janmaat pulled one back for Watford with 15 minutes to play. Younes Kaboul closes down Liverpool's Roberto Firmino But Georginio Wijnaldum rounded off a sublime performance from Liverpool on the stroke of full-time to fire the Reds top of the table heading into the international break. Liverpool had a plethora of chances before making the breakthrough, with the first coming after nine minutes when Adam Lallana's cross found Firmino in the box, but his header was well saved by Heurelho Gomes. Philippe Coutinho celebrates with his Liverpool team-mates after scoring The Watford stopper was in action again eight minutes later as he got down low to keep out a header from Lucas before Coutinho shot wide from six yards. Sadio Mane surged forward on the left-hand side before playing in his team-mate and after taking a touch to round the defenders, shot agonisingly wide of the upright. Firmino also skewed a shot wide in the 24th minute after Coutinho slipped him into the box but Mane eventually found the breakthrough three minutes later. The Senegal international met a cross from Coutinho from the left flank, following a short corner with James Milner, with a header which powered into the back of the net. Liverpool's Jordan Henderson and Philippe Coutinho were both delighted after their 6-1 win over Watford Liverpool's Jordan Henderson and Philippe Coutinho were both delighted after their 6-1 win over Watford That opened the floodgates for Jurgen Klopp's men as Coutinho added his name to the scoresheet three minutes later. It was a brilliant flowing attack as Lallana played in Firmino at the top of the box, who in turn found his countryman to his left. Coutinho's touch was again sublime as he made his way through the defenders surrounding him before firing home through the legs of Younes Kaboul. Sadio Mane scored twice during the win at Anfield Gomes injured his knee during the goal and was replaced by Costel Pantilimon but the Romanian was not able to stop the rampant Reds with Can added the third in the 43rd minute. Coutinho played in Lallana on the right of the box, whose cross found the German at the back post - having got away from Nordin Amrabat - and he slotted home to give Liverpool a commanding half-time lead. Despite the scoreline, it was an even start to the second period, with Coutinho going close in the opening five minutes as his effort from the top of the box just went over the crossbar. Liverpool midfielder Emre Can celebrates after scoring The fourth goal eventually came for Liverpool in the 57th minute as Firmino completed the scoring for the front three. Lallana was the man to turn provider once again as he flashed the ball across goal and it found the Brazilian who tapped home past Pantilimon at point blank range. Mane nabbed his second three minutes later to make it 5-0 with another tap in from Firmino's low cross after the forward had been played though by Milner.

With Jose Mourinho serving a one-match touchline ban, United broke a three-game Premier League run without scoring as Ibrahimovic netted twice to end his own goalless streak and Pogba fired home a stunner all before half-time. Mike van der Hoorn scored a late consolation for a lacklustre Swansea, who are still without a win since the opening day of the season. Manchester United's Paul Pogba volleys home their opener against Swansea The victory moves United up to sixth, but they remain eight points off Liverpool at the top of the Premier League, while Swansea remain level on points with Sunderland at the bottom of the table. Mourinho's side had a very experienced look to it as Michael Carrick and Phil Jones were handed their first Premier League starts of the season. Jose Mourinho says his Man Utd side had total control during their 3-1 victory over Swansea Jose Mourinho says his Man Utd side had total control during their 3-1 victory over Swansea Wayne Rooney was also included from the off as United's youngest player was 23-year-old Paul Pogba. Bob Bradley, who is still without a win as Swans boss, also rang the changes from Swansea's limp 3-1 defeat at Stoke, bringing in Leon Britton, Stephen Kingsley, Angel Rangel and Borja Baston. Swansea manager Bob Bradley says there is a lot of work to be done Swansea manager Bob Bradley says there is a lot of work to be done United were at it from the first whistle while Swansea allowed their previously out-of-form visitors to play at whatever pace they liked. It took just 13 minutes for United to strike as Pogba gave everyone a timely reminder of why he's been named on the 30-man shortlist for the Ballon d'Or. Pogba celebrates after scoring United's opener A long ball into the Swansea area was only half cleared to the former Juventus man, who showed tremendous technique to half-volley the ball from 22 yards straight into the top-right corner. Ibrahimovic last went seven league appearances without a goal while playing for Juventus in 2006, where he suffered a nine-game drought, but he ended his most recent run by doubling United's lead on 21 minutes. Manchester United's Zlatan Ibrahimovic scores his side's second goal Rooney found the Swede with a crisp pass, and from 25 yards out he dropped his shoulder before pinging a low effort beyond the grasp of Lukasz Fabianski, who should've done better. It was the 25,000th goal scored in the Premier League. Rooney and Ibrahimovic revelled in the space afforded to them by the lacklustre Swansea midfield. Ibrahimovic ended a seven-game goalless streak by scoring at Swansea They linked up again to make it 3-0 on 33 minutes as Ibrahimovic scored his 400th league career goal. Once again Swansea stood off Rooney, who played in the Swedish star to bruise through a weak tackle from Angel Rangel and poke home from 15 yards. The game was over as a contest from that moment as Swansea left the field at half-time to huge boos from their disgruntled home fans. Zlatan Ibrahimovic was disappointed to pick up a yellow card.

The booking rules him out of Man Utd's next game against Arsenal, live on Sky Sports Jefferson Montero's introduction at the break improved Swansea, albeit only slightly, and they got their consolation on 69 minutes when Van der Hoorn rose to plant a header into the net from a Gylfi Sigurdsson set-piece. It wasn't an entirely perfect 90 minutes for Mourinho as Ibrahimovic picked up his fifth booking of the season for a foul on Leroy Fer, which means he'll miss the next fixture against Arsenal.

Jamie Redknapp and Emile Heskey look at Leicester's upcoming fixtures and discuss the possibility of them slipping into a relegation battle Jamie Redknapp and Emile Heskey look at Leicester's upcoming fixtures and discuss the possibility of them slipping into a relegation battle James Morrison had initially put West Brom ahead earlier in the second half before they were quickly pegged back by the head of Islam Slimani. But West Brom would go on to find the winner, as they claimed three points for the first time in six games to climb above Leicester and into 11th in the table. Phillips (right) hit the winner for West Brom It was lively at the King Power at kick-off, but the fans in all four corners of the ground were soon quietened by what was an event-free first 45 minutes. Both sides generally set up to not have the ball, and it was Leicester who were forced to dominate possession as West Brom looked to sit deep and play on the counter. West Brom boss Tony Pulis says his side put in a very good performance West Brom boss Tony Pulis says his side put in a very good performance Jamie Vardy was back on the bench for Leicester, but the attacking duo put out by Claudio Ranieri in Slimani and Shinji Okazaki barely had a look-in while Salomon Rondon was equally isolated at the other end for West Brom. The game did spring into life almost immediately after the break, however, and after so long without either side really looking like scoring, there were two goals in almost as many minutes. West Bromwich Albion's Jonny Evans in action First, West Brom took the lead after 52 minutes via Morrison, who headed home on his first Premier League start since January after Phillips' cross had deflected into his path. And just three minutes later the game was level, as Leicester repeated the same trick at the other end, Riyad Mahrez swinging one onto the head of Slimani, which the Algerian striker duly nodded past Ben Foster. Darren Fletcher says it was West Brom's intention to come and win at Leicester Darren Fletcher says it was West Brom's intention to come and win at Leicester Leicester immediately upped the ante in search for a goal that would have put them in front, but it was West Brom who struck next in the 72nd minute thanks to a disastrous error from Drinkwater. Islam Slimani (left) scored Leicester's only goal of the game His attempt at a backwards pass on halfway served only to feed Phillips in behind, who duly ran on before finishing coolly past Ron-Robert Zieler, who was in for the injured Kasper Schmeichel in the Leicester goal. The Foxes pushed for an equaliser again, but their efforts were in vain and their run of 20 Premier League home games without defeat finally came to an end to leave them 14th in the table after just three wins from their first 11.

With David Moyes serving a one-game touchline ban, Sunderland fell behind to Dan Gosling's goal but Victor Anichebe levelled things up, scoring his first league goal for 546 days. Things looked bleak for under-pressure Moyes with 30 minutes remaining when Steven Pienaar was shown a second yellow card but Jermain Defoe scored from the penalty spot on 74 minutes. Bournemouth threw everything at the visitors in the closing stages, but goalkeeper Jordan Pickford and his back four stood strong to give the North East club a huge victory. Jermain Defoe (left) scored Sunderland's winning goal from the penalty spot The win moves Sunderland level on five points with Swansea, but they remain bottom on goal difference. Sky Sports pundit Jamie Carragher labelled Lamine Kone's performance in the 4-1 defeat against Arsenal \"not acceptable\", but he was not one of three changes made by Moyes, who was watching this game from the stands after accepting a misconduct charge. David Moyes (left) was serving a touchline ban Papy Djilobodji, Paddy McNair and Anichebe replaced John O'Shea, Jack Rodwell and Whabi Khazri while Eddie Howe was without Andrew Surman and Callum Wilson, who were both missing with minor knocks. Gosling had a chance to impress in Surman's absence and struck to give his team the lead on 11 minutes. Junior Stanislas takes on Paddy McNair Patrick van Aanholt went to sleep and Adam Smith took full advantage of the space. He sprinted down the right flank before sending a ball into the area, which was turned in from close range by the former Everton man. Dan Gosling (right) scored Bournemouth's first Bournemouth were carving Sunderland open every time they went forward and Pickford had to be alert to block a Josh King effort after Van Aanholt had switched off again. However, the visitors carried a threat of their own and levelled the match on 33 minutes. Anichebe, on his first start in the Premier League for Sunderland, showed great strength to hold off Simon Francis in the box and he kept his composure to smash home from an acute angle. David Moyes praised the spirit of his Sunderland team as they came back from a goal down David Moyes praised the spirit of his Sunderland team as they came back from a goal down With the game in the balance, Pienaar lost his head. Already on a booking for a foul on Jack Wilshere, the Sunderland man made a rash, dangerous tackle on Junior Stanislas right in front of referee Mike Dean, who was left with no option but to send off Pienaar. From then on, it was backs against the wall for Sunderland as Howe's men pinned the visitors back. It seemed only a matter of time before they would regain the lead, but Wilshere missed from close range on 66 minutes after a neat one-two with Stanislas. Eddie Howe was left frustrated after Bournemouth lost to Sunderland Eddie Howe was left frustrated after Bournemouth lost to Sunderland However, with Moyes probably fearing for his job, the 10-men scored an unlikely winner. The all-action Anichebe burst into the box and Smith hauled him down just as he was about to shoot. Steven Pienaar (third from right) is shown a red card by Mike Dean Defoe stepped up and, despite the pressurised situation, he kept his cool to fire powerfully into the net.

Palace Highlights of Burnley 3-2 Crystal Palace An injury-time strike from Ashley Barnes sealed a 3-2 win for Burnley against Crystal Palace at Turf Moor on Saturday. The home side had appeared to be cruising towards a comfortable victory when leading 2-0 at the break thanks to early goals from Sam Vokes, after just 78 seconds, and Johann Berg Gudmundsson. However, Palace boss Alan Pardew's double substitution just before the hour-mark paid immediate dividends, with striker Connor Wickham reducing the deficit with his very first touch. When Christian Benteke converted an 81st-minute penalty, it appeared as though the spoils would be shared, only for Barnes to make a last-gasp intervention. As a result, Burnley have jumped up to ninth in the Premier League table following their fourth home win of the season, while Palace have slipped to 15th after picking up only one point from their last six league games. Sam Vokes gave Burnley a second-minute lead at Turf Moor The Clarets made two changes from last weekend's heroic goalless draw at Manchester United, with influential Belgian midfielder Steven Defour back after recovering from a hamstring problem. Meanwhile, on-loan Liverpool left-back Jon Flanagan made his first Premier League start for the club in place of the hamstrung Stephen Ward. However, boss Sean Dyche opted to continue with just Vokes in attack, meaning forward Andre Gray had to settle for a place on the substitutes' bench, along with the fit-again George Boyd. Burnley boss Sean Dyche says it was a nervy game to watch as his side beat Crystal Palace 3-2 Burnley boss Sean Dyche says it was a nervy game to watch as his side beat Crystal Palace 3-2 As for the visitors, Pardew opted to make three alterations from last Saturday's 4-2 loss at home to Liverpool, with Damien Delaney, Jason Puncheon and Andros Townsend all recalled to the starting line-up as he sought to end a run of three straight league defeats. But Palace could not have made a worst start to the match after falling behind after just two minutes, and Pardew will be furious with the opening strike, coming as it did after his side had won a first-minute corner. Much as they did in their 2-0 home win against Liverpool earlier in the season, though, Burnley were at their most dangerous when their opponents were attacking. After losing the ball from that early set play, Jeff Hendrick broke upfield at pace, before feeding Gudmundsson in the box, who in turn crossed to the unmarked Matthew Lowton at the far post. And after Steve Mandanda had parried the right back's low shot, Vokes was there in the right place to tap in from virtually on the goal line for his third goal in his previous four league games. Crystal Palace boss Alan Pardew says his side dominated the game as they lost late on at Burnley Crystal Palace boss Alan Pardew says his side dominated the game as they lost late on at Burnley Palace came close to equalising just before the quarter-hour mark, but found Tom Heaton once again in imperious form as the England international kept out Wilfried Zaha's close-range effort. However, seconds later Burnley had doubled their lead as Vokes picked out Gudmundsson's run, although the Iceland international still had much to do before beating Mandanda with a low shot from the left-hand edge of the area that the Frenchman got hands to, but was unable to keep out. Burnley's players celebrate their win against Crystal Palace at Turf Moor The contest was turned on its head, though, as Pardew introduced Wickham and switched around wingers Zaha and Townsend, with the former then creating a goal for the substitute with an inch-perfect right-wing centre. After that, it was all Palace and it came as no surprise when the visitors deservedly levelled matters nine minutes from time after another pacy counter, this time following a Burnley corner. On this occasion it was Townsend who created the goal as the wide man's left-wing cross was handled by Lowton, with referee Anthony Taylor wasting no time in pointing to the spot Benteke kept his cool from by sending Heaton the wrong way after his usual two-step run-up and at that stage, if any team looked like going on and claiming the win, it was the Eagles. However, in the fourth minute of stoppage time Burnley once again caught their opponents on the break, this time after a Palace free kick was launched into the box. Crystal Palace striker Connor Wickham races away after scoring with his first touch against Burnley After the home side had cleared their lines, though, they caught Palace out on a two versus one, with Gudmundsson crossing for Barnes to smash home his first goal since the 2014-15 season from six yards out. Incredibly that was not the end of the drama as right from the re-start, and in the fifth and final minute of injury time, the ball dropped to Townsend on the edge of the area, only for his sweetly struck volley to beat the motionless Heaton, but strike the inside of the post and bounce to safety.

Aguero gives Manchester City the lead late in the first half Middlesbrough levelled at the death through De Roon's powerful header from George Friend's fine cross, continuing their up-turn in form in the top flight.

Pep Guardiola was left frustrated after his Man City side conceded a late equaliser at home to Middlesbrough Pep Guardiola was left frustrated after his Man City side conceded a late equaliser at home to Middlesbrough Pep Guardiola made three changes from the side that beat Barcelona in midweek, welcoming Jesus Navas, Aleksandar Kolarov and Claudio Bravo back into the fold. The hosts struggled against a resolute Boro defence early on, and were kept largely at bay until the final stages of the first period despite having over 75 per cent of possession. Sergio Aguero (L) celebrates scoring the opening goal for City Valdes beat away Aguero's effort from inside the area just after the half-hour mark after the Argentine had found space, before Valdes was at his best to superbly deny his compatriot David Silva's close-range shot. Aguero then half-volleyed just wide from a left-wing cross, but City got their goal two minutes before the break through the striker, his 150th for the club since joining in 2011. Aitor Karanka was pleased with his Middlesbrough side's second-half performance after they drew at Manchester City Aitor Karanka was pleased with his Middlesbrough side's second-half performance after they drew at Manchester City Picking the ball up on the right, De Bruyne's fine low cross found the boot of Aguero at the near post, and he duly poked it into the bottom right corner past Valdes. Navas hit the post for City with an audacious effort from an acute angle, which Valdes looked to have covered, but Boro came out in the second half with more attacking intent. Ilkay Gundogan crosses under pressure from Adam Forshaw Former City man Alvaro Negredo forced Bravo into a save with an effort from the halfway line, before Bravo darted off his line to deny Adam Forshaw from 10 yards. City huffed and puffed for a second, with Ilkay Gundogan volleying wide and Aguero heading over the bar, but they should have been home and dry with four minutes remaining. Middlesbrough's Victor Valdes gets down to collect a cross Receiving the ball inside the area unmarked from Jesus Navas' cut back, Aguero steered the ball inches wide when he should have scored. And the hosts were punished in the first minute of stoppage time as Friend's deep cross went over the head of Negredo, but Dutch midfielder De Roon was on hand to power a header past Bravo, who got a touch on it.

The second half initially brought more of the forgettable same until Phil Bardsley - implementing his own shoot-on-sight policy - fired in a 40-yarder to go with two outrageously ambitious first-half volleys. Manuel Lanzini takes on Bruno Martins Indi Bilic, like most in the ground, had seen enough and made a double change that gave his side a double-pronged attack and freed up space for Payet. It was West Ham's star turn who delivered the goal, as Antonio met his whipped cross with a header that nicked Whelan's shoulder on its way in. Antonio may yet argue the toss with the Premier League; on first glance it appeared a legitimate sixth headed goal of the season for the England man. Policing measures inside the stadium prior to the match There was no doubting the scorer of the equaliser, though Walters and a reluctant Adrian will compete for the assist. Racing needlessly from his goal, the Spaniard succeeded only in clattering Walters as the Irishman lifted the ball over his head. A penalty would surely have followed had Bojan not mopped up in neat style. It might have got worse for Adrian, too, but his unconvincing attempt at keeping out Adam's free-kick just about smuggled the ball round the post.

Eden Hazard scored twice as Chelsea powered to the top of the Premier League with an emphatic 5-0 thrashing of Everton at Stamford Bridge on Saturday evening. In a hugely one-sided contest, Hazard set the hosts on their way with the opening goal in the 19th minute. Marcos Alonso doubled the advantage 23 seconds later and Diego Costa made it 3-0 shortly before the break. Hazard scored the fourth for a Chelsea side brimming with confidence and Pedro completed the rout in the 65th minute. Chelsea's Eden Hazard celebrates scoring his side's fourth goal of the game against Everton The win sees Chelsea go top of the Premier League after Manchester City were held at home by Middlesbrough earlier in the day. It is also their fifth successive league victory and clean sheet, neither of which ever really looked in doubt against an overwhelmed and below-par Everton. Diego Costa celebrates scoring for Chelsea with Gary Cahill Toffees boss Ronald Koeman tried to match the hosts with three at the back, as Phil Jagielka and Maarten Stekelenburg returned to the starting line-up along with Tom Cleverley. But the visitors' plans started to unravel as soon as the 19th minute when Gareth Barry lost possession midway inside the Chelsea half, the hosts countered and Hazard cut in from the left and fired into the far corner. Less than a minute later it was 2-0 as Hazard's clever turn set up another break and Pedro cut across for Alonso to drill a shot through the legs of Stekelenburg. Chelsea continued to dominate and Victor Moses struck the post after meeting Alonso's cross on the half volley. Hazard takes on Everton's Ramiro Funes Mori in the first half The visitors offered nothing in response in a remarkably one-sided first half. Costa extended Chelsea's lead in the 42nd minute when he fired in from a corner and the striker could have scored a second in injury-time when he raced clear, but failed to hit the target. Steve Bates feels that Antonio Conte has given a new identity to Chelsea since their change to the 3-4-3 system Steve Bates feels that Antonio Conte has given a new identity to Chelsea since their change to the 3-4-3 system The slick hosts did add another after the break, Hazard driving goalwards after collecting a backheel from Pedro and then drilling a shot into the bottom corner. Everton looked completely hapless and, after Stekelenburg saved from Costa, it was 5-0 when Hazard's shot was palmed out for Pedro to finish into an empty net. Still the visitors showed no sign of a comeback and Stekelenburg had to save from Costa and then David Luiz as Chelsea pushed for more. Moses had the hosts' final chance but he saw his effort saved as Antonio Conte's side had to settle for five.

The Ivory Coast striker had failed to find the net in seven appearances for the Potters since his summer loan move, but struck inside three minutes to get himself off the mark. Wayne Routledge equalised five minutes later, but Stoke ran away with the game in the second half after an Alfie Mawson own-goal ten minutes after the restart was added to by Bony in the 73rd minute. Mark Hughes' men are now five games unbeaten in the league and move up to 12th, while Swansea are winless since the opening day of the season and remain second from bottom. Wilfried Bony scored twice against Swansea on Monday Night Football The 100th Premier League game of the season got off to a fast start and it was a former Swansea double act that outdid the visitors almost immediately. Xherdan Shaqiri played in a corner that found Wales midfielder Joe Allen on the left of the box, passing the ball into the path of Bony who slotted home past Lukasz Fabianksi. The Swans levelled in the eighth minute, as Gylfi Sigurdsson's cross found Routledge - who had got himself ahead of Phil Bardsley - and headed home to see the sides level in a raucous first ten minutes. Wayne Routledge levels it up for Swansea Bony could have added a second not long after as he sent an effort curling past the post from 20 yards, before Stoke hit the woodwork for the first time. Marko Arnautovic played the ball to Charlie Adam at the top of the box and he struck the ball with power - but it bounced off the post and went wide. Adam - making his first Premier League start of the season - hit the post for the second time with ten minutes of the first period to play, this time finding the right-hand side with a fierce left-footed drive before Arnautovic did the same five minutes later. Stoke boss Mark Hughes was pleased with his side's attacking play Stoke boss Mark Hughes was pleased with his side's attacking play Ramadan Sohby nicked back possession before finding Allen in the middle of the park. The Welshman then picked out a brilliant run by the Austria international at the top of the box, who rounded the oncoming Fabianski but could only see his effort rattle the woodwork once again. Swansea could have gone ahead just before the break as Fernando Llorente played a delightful knockdown into the path of Routledge, but his shot from the edge of the box forced a smart leaping save from Stoke goalkeeper Lee Grant. Bony says he always knew the goals would come Bony says he always knew the goals would come Both sides started well in the second half, but it was an own goal that saw the Potters go ahead again in the 55th minute. Sobhy - who had replaced Shaqiri in the first half - showed some fantastic skill to get away from Angel Rangel on the left of the box, with his shot turned into the net by Swansea defender Mawson. Chances were mostly at a premium during the second 45 minutes, with Neil Taylor having an attempt from 25 yards that went wide before a fine passing move from Stoke saw Charlie Adam also fly a shot over the crossbar. Swansea boss Bob Bradley says his side are lacking in belief and made critical mistakes Swansea boss Bob Bradley says his side are lacking in belief and made critical mistakes But they got their third as Allen and Bony once again caused heartbreak for their former side. Arnautovic played in the Welshman on the left of the box who saw his original shot saved by Fabianksi before poking the rebound into the path of Bony and he headed home for his second of the evening. Ramadan Sobhi celebrates as his shot leads to an own goal by Alfie Mawson It was Swansea who could have nicked a goal in the closing minutes as Borja Baston saw his shot skim the crossbar before the visitors were denied a penalty after Erik Pieters fouled Routledge. Referee Michael Oliver had pointed to the spot but, after consulting with the linesman, judged that the initial contact had come outside the box and instead awarded a free kick. The Swans continued to probe but to no avail as Stoke kept them out and picked up a third consecutive Premier League win.

Romelu Lukaku scored his ninth goal in his last nine matches against the Hammers to put the hosts ahead in the 50th minute. Ross Barkley doubled the advantage in the 76th minute, finishing from Lukaku's pass to score his first league goal since the opening day of the season. West Ham, who had won their last three games in a row, rarely threatened after a bright start that saw Pedro Obiang and Manuel Lanzini both go close. Romelu Lukaku of Everton celebrates after scoring against West Ham The victory is Everton's first in the league for over a month and moves them five points off top spot. With Maarten Stekelenburg ruled out, Joel Robles started in goal for Everton, with Ramiro Funes Mori getting the nod ahead of Phil Jagielka in defence. As he did in the EFL Cup in midweek, Michail Antonio was preferred up front for West Ham, who made the better start to a game that was preceded by tributes to former Toffees player and manager Howard Kendall on the first anniversary of his death. Romelu Lukaku is the third Everton player to score 50 Premier League goals, after Duncan Ferguson (60) and Tim Cahill (56) Antonio diverted a cross over the bar before Obiang fired over from inside the box as two defenders slid in to block. Robles then saved from Dimitri Payet as the visitors continued to look the brighter side. At the other end, Lukaku failed to control Idrissa Gueye's shot in front of goal as the hosts struggled to get going. Lanzini curled wide after swerving round Funes Mori before Adrian produced the moment of the half, reacting sharply to superbly stop Barkley's shot with one hand. Yannick Bolasie has a shot blocked by Mark Noble That was the closest either side came before the break, but the Hammers' level dropped markedly in the second half. They fell behind in the 50th minute as Adrian palmed out a shot from Seamus Coleman and Yannick Bolasie reacted quickly to sweep the rebound across goal for Lukaku to head in. Barkley then curled over the bar from just outside the area as Everton looked to add to their advantage. West Ham enjoyed prolonged spells of pressure but couldn't make it count They were almost undone by some slack defensive work from Ashley Williams, who lost out to Antonio and was grateful to see Robles save. But otherwise the visitors hardly threatened and the game was as good as done when Barkley doubled the advantage, finishing at the back post from Bolasie's cross. Lukaku and Tom Cleverley were both denied by Adrian as Everton finished the game on top and comfortably saw out victory.

Eden Hazard of Chelsea (L) is challenged by Oriol Romeu of Southampton It took just six minutes for Hazard to break the deadlock.

of the Premier League. Alexis Sanchez put the Gunners ahead in the 19th minute but Sunderland responded in the second-half thanks to Jermain Defoe's penalty after Duncan Watmore was brought down by Petr Cech. With the game in the balance Arsene Wenger introduced Olivier Giroud and the Frenchman scored with his first touch in the 71st minute before securing the points with a deft header five minutes later. Sanchez completed the scoring in the 78th minute, his 50th Arsenal goal helping the Gunners stay level with Manchester City at the summit, while piling more pressure on Sunderland boss David Moyes. Defeat leaves the hosts with just two points after 10 games, their -13 goal difference meaning this is the worst start to a Premier League season. Arsenal were forced into two changes at the Stadium of Light with both Theo Walcott and Nacho Monreal failing late fitness tests. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Kieran Gibbs came into the side and were both heavily involved as Arsenal dominated the early stages. Steven Pienaar (C) is fouled by Francis Coquelin In just the second minute Sunderland goalkeeper Jordan Pickford's nervy clearance was closed down by Sanchez before the goalkeeper was forced to turn behind an Oxlade-Chamberlain's header just a few moments later. Arsene Wenger praised the quality of Arsenal's goals as they beat Sunderland 4-1 in the Premier League Arsene Wenger praised the quality of Arsenal's goals as they beat Sunderland 4-1 in the Premier League Sunderland were struggling to have any impact on the game, unlike Sanchez, who was involved in almost everything for the visitors. The Chile international's inch-perfect through ball picked out the run of Mesut Ozil in the 13th minute but the German's shot was easily saved. A minute later and Arsenal were in again after Sanchez's pass released Francis Coquelin, but the Frenchman didn't have the pace to get away from Lamine Kone. Alexis Sanchez of Arsenal (C) scores his sides first goal The breakthrough eventually came for the Gunners in the 19th minute as Oxlade-Chamberlain burst past Duncan Watmore before producing a brilliant cross for Sanhcez, who nipped in ahead of Kone, to head his side in front. Five minutes later, Sunderland though they were back on level terms as Defoe swept home from close range, however, Wahbi Khazri was rightly ruled to be offside in the build-up. Oxlade-Chamberlain, who scored twice in midweek in Arsenal's EFL Cup win against Reading, threatened again as the first-half came to a close but his low effort was comfortably saved by Pickford, Alexis Sanchez of Arsenal and Lamine Kone of Sunderland compete for the ball The England international was involved again minutes later as his pass released Ozil, who should have made it 2-0 but did not get enough on his lobbed attempt to let the advancing Pickford and his team-mates off the hook. Sunderland returned after the break in a more determined mood, but Oxlade-Chamberlain squandered another golden opportunity after being played in behind a square defence once again and Sanchez was astonished not to be awarded a 62nd-minute penalty after going down under Kone's challenge. Referee Martin Atkinson, however, did point to the spot at the other end two minutes later after Watmore had skipped away from the Arsenal defence and been tripped by Cech, and Defoe obliged from 12 yards to level the scores. But the joy was short-lived for the home fans as Giroud scored with his first two touches after coming on as a substitute, sweeping home Gibbs' cross to restore his side's lead and heading home Ozil's cross five minutes later. Olivier Giroud celebrates after scoring against Sunderland Sanchez converted from close range moments later after Gibbs' powerful shot rebounded off the post to complete a miserable afternoon for Sunderland and leave them rooted to the bottom of the table.

Heaton-inspired Burnley at Old Trafford United had 37 shots on goal, but found Heaton in impenetrable form as he made 11 saves. Zlatan Ibrahimovic was the chief profligate for United, missing at least three gilt-edged chances from 12 shots at goal, meaning he has now gone six league games without scoring for the first time since December 2007 with Inter Milan. Ander Herrera is given his marching orders United's frustration boiled over as Mourinho was sent to the stand at half time for his angry reaction to United not being awarded a penalty for a tackle on Matteo Darmian, while referee Mark Clattenberg also dismissed Herrera midway through the second half for two bookings. Mourinho's men are now without a Premier League win in four matches and are eight points off the top spot. Ibrahimovic set the tone early on with a forceful run, but his strike from 22 yards was gathered by Heaton. That effort was one of seven shots on target during a one-sided half where United's finishing let them down. Burnley boss Sean Dyche reflects on his sides draw away at Manchester United. Burnley boss Sean Dyche reflects on his sides draw away at Manchester United. The best of those chances came on 19 minutes when Marcus Rashford slipped Ibrahimovic in behind but his close range effort was blocked away by Heaton. The former United goalkeeper later turned a Juan Mata effort wide on 24 minutes before making an even better stop three minutes before the break. Lingard's header from a Herrera cross was heading for the top corner until Heaton clawed out the effort with a strong right hand. Mourinho was left raging on the touchline just before half time when a penalty claim was waved away by referee Mark Clattenburg after Darmian went down following a clash with Burnley substitute Jon Flanagan. The United boss appeared from the tunnel at half time, but took his seat in the crowd next to the dugout as it emerged that Clattenburg had sent him to the stands at the break.

Jose Mourinho protests after his side weren't awarded a penalty Even when Heaton was beaten, the woodwork came to Burnley's rescue. Mata struck the outside of the post on 65 minutes before Ibrahimovic looped a header towards goal a minute later, but the ball came bouncing back off the crossbar. You'd think things couldn't get more frustrating for the hosts, but they were reduced to 10-men three minutes later. Herrera, who had already been booked for a late tackle on Dean Marney in the first half, slipped on the turf and his motion clattered into Matthew Lowton. Clattenburg was quick on the scene to give the Spaniard his marching orders. Tom Heaton of Burnley (middle) saves a shot from Zlatan Ibrahimovic The man advantage usually swings a momentum of a game but the 10-men of United still probed and pressed for the opening goal. Luke Shaw, Daley Blind and substitute Rooney all curled efforts close with time running out but the final chance fell to Ibrahimovic. Mourinho is sent to the stands to watch the second half of the clash with Burnley Paul Pogba's cross from the left was perfect and found the 35-year-old unmarked, from no more than three yards. With the goal gaping, he somehow managed to spoon the ball wide With that miss, Heaton got the clean sheet his performance merited but you could tell from the cheeky smiles from the Burnley players at full time that this was a point courtesy more of luck than judgement. For United, it was a case of everything but the goal.

Middlesbrough 2-0 Bournemouth A stunning goal from Gaston Ramirez and a second from Stewart Downing earned Middlesbrough a deserved 2-0 win over Bournemouth at the Riverside. Ramirez broke the deadlock six minutes before the break when he collected the ball inside his own half and burst forward, before cutting inside on to his right foot and slotting home a superb solo goal. And though Bournemouth came out after half-time looking for a response, Boro got a second when Adama Traore curled a delicious cross with the outside of his boot on to the head of Alvaro Negredo, who nodded across goal for Downing to tuck home (56). The visitors pushed for a comeback, but had their efforts stunted by an injury to Andrew Surman after manager Eddie Howe had made all three of his substitutions, and the 10-man Cherries were unable to breach Boro's organised back-line. Gaston Ramirez scored a stunning opening goal at the Riverside Aitor Karanka's Middlesbrough went into the game without a win in the league since August and were facing the prospect of dropping into the relegation zone for the first time this season with a loss against in-form Bournemouth. However, there was no sign of that poor run impacting on the team's confidence in the early stages as Boro went toe-to-toe with the much-vaunted Cherries, bossing midfield and looking dangerous down the flanks. Eddie Howe reflects on his Bournemouth sides loss to Middlesbrough Eddie Howe reflects on his Bournemouth sides loss to Middlesbrough It took Howe's men a while to grow into the game, but his side - who had not lost a game in six matches prior to the trip to the Riverside - found their spark in the 12th minute when Josh King found space in a training-ground corner routine, only to see his strike cleared off the line. And it was King who went close again with the pick of the visitors' chances, controlling a chipped Jack Wilshere pass on his chest before volleying a shot against the crossbar in the 18th minute. On first viewing it appeared Boro had got lucky, but replays shows that the onrushing Victor Valdes had got his fingertips to the shot, superbly tipping it on to the crossbar. Both teams felt they could have had penalties in the game, with Traore having appeals waved away after stumbling yards after the initial contact, and King being denied a spot-kick after being wiped out by the knee of a charging Valdes. But the deadlock was broken when Ramirez burst clear of a struggling Wilshere in midfield and produced his classy swerve and shot to open the scoring. And Downing's second, which followed shortly after the interval, ultimately wrapped up the win for Boro and gave the 32-year-old his first Premier League goal for the club since May 2008. Callum Wilson and Jordon Ibe made way for Benik Afobe and Ryan Fraser, Afobe's good work allowing Adam Smith to strike from 12 yards, only for Calum Chambers to get in the way. The Cherries ensured no further damage was done as Wilshere tracked back with a goal-saving challenge to rob Traore and though Fraser threatened a consolation with a cross-shot that required Valdes' attention, there was no way back.

Leicester Tottenham 1-1 Leicester Tottenham's stuttering Premier League form continued as they were held to a 1-1 draw at home by Leicester on Saturday. Vincent Janssen gave Spurs the lead with his first league goal, converting from the penalty spot in the 44th minute after he had been fouled by Robert Huth. But Ahmed Musa equalised shortly after half-time as the Foxes claimed their first away point of the season, frustrating once again the side they pipped to the title last term. Claudio Ranieri reflects on the draw Claudio Ranieri reflects on the draw Jan Vertonghen headed against the bar late on for Spurs, who remain unbeaten but have now drawn three league games in a row. Mauricio Pochettino may well be counting down the days until Harry Kane returns from injury, after another game in which Tottenham enjoyed plenty of possession but lacked a cutting edge up front. With Erik Lamela out due to illness, Janssen started for Spurs, while Jamie Vardy returned to the Leicester line-up, but neither forward had much to work with in the early stages as chances were at a premium. Claudio Ranieri has never lost a Premier League game against Spurs (W7, D4) Dele Alli saw a well-struck first-time shot saved by Kasper Schmeichel before Victor Wanyama dragged an effort wide. Leicester did spurn a couple of openings after the half-hour mark; Vardy failing to control when he would have been in on goal and Shinji Okazaki heading over from Riyad Mahrez's cross. Janssen then turned the ball across the face of goal before Alli smacked the bar from Kyle Walker's cut-back. The key moment of the first half came shortly before the break as Huth was penalised for dragging down Janssen in the box and the striker stepped up to convert the penalty. Victor Wanyama (L) tussles with Shinji Okazaki But Leicester levelled in the 48th minute after Wanyama's misplaced header was picked up by Vardy and he crossed for Musa to finish at the back post. The shot was the Foxes' first on target, but they enjoyed the better of the second half. Spurs, though, did go close as Janssen shot narrowly wide after turning away from Huth and then Vertonghen headed against the bar late in the game. Substitute Leonardo Ulloa almost won it for Leicester deep into stoppage time, but he saw his header across goal go past the post.

It was a cruel loss for Hull, who rarely shone in attack, but had looked resolute in defence before Dawson inadvertently turned the ball into his own net in the 82nd minute. Watford attacked in waves down the right through Nordin Amrabat, but it was the returning Daryl Janmaat who sent in the cross which led to the winner. Victory means Watford have picked up eight points in their last four league games, while Hull remain in the relegation zone. Michael Dawson of Hull City (R) is dejected after the final whistle during the Premier League match between Watford and Hull In the first ever top-flight meeting between the two sides, captain Troy Deeney was searching for a 100th Watford goal, having scored against Hull on the last three occasions. And Deeney almost gave Watford the lead from kick-off, but he was inches away from meeting Amrabat's cross. Mike Phelan reflects on his sides loss away at Watford. Mike Phelan reflects on his sides loss away at Watford. The hosts continued to threaten and hit the woodwork twice in quick succession after just five minutes. The first came from a corner as Younes Kaboul saw his header cannon off the crossbar, with Hull failing to clear their lines after. The ball eventually fell to Roberto Pereyra, but his curled effort from distance flicked the outside of the post with David Marshall beaten. Hull City's Will Keane (left) challenges for the ball with Watford's Etienne Capoue Watford failed to make their early pressure count as the pace of the game dropped, while Hull did not create any telling chances in the first half. Just before the break, Amrabat hit a half-volley into the ground and it bounced over to Deeney at the far post, but the Watford captain could only head wide. Hull's greatest chance of the game fell five minutes into the second half, with Abel Hernandez latching onto a Will Keane flick-on, but the striker could only shoot straight at Heurelho Gomes. Heurelho Gomes jumps for joy as he celebrates Watford's winner Time and time again Amrabat threatened down the right, constantly getting the better of Sam Clucas, but the final ball was often lacking from the Dutch winger. Instead, it was Janmaat's cross which led to the goal, with the ball ricocheting off Dawson - and the Hull captain could only watch on as it sailed beyond the helpless Marshall. Watford could have doubled their advantage with three minutes to go, but Odion Ighalo shot narrowly wide after working his way into a shooting position.

Sergio Aguero's first goals since their last success - a 3-1 win at Swansea on September 24 - had City 2-0 up at the break, with his second in particular one to savour. After a week in which the Spanish press linked him with moves to Tottenham, Arsenal and Chelsea, it was a timely reminder of how crucial he is to his current club and what they wish to achieve. West Brom had chances to get back into the game midway through the second half, but could not take them and Ilkay Gundogan's late double sealed a routine victory for the away side. Aguero is congratulated after scoring his first goal for Manchester City in more than a month Pep Guardiola's men go top of the Premier League again as a result, two goals ahead of Arsenal, with the outcome providing a much-needed boost ahead of Tuesday's Champions League tie with Barcelona. So much had been made of the fact City had endured the longest run of games without a win of Guardiola's managerial career following their midweek EFL Cup defeat at Manchester United. Yet, if the sequence had impacted on confidence in any way, it did not show at The Hawthorns as they dictated from the start. Nolito had the ball in the net after just 10 minutes following an intricate move, but his goal was disallowed because Aguero had strayed offside. However, the Argentina international made up for that. His first goal was a smart finish, made to look easy following a perfectly-weighted pass from Gundogan when in truth the execution was terrific as he shot low across Ben Foster and in. Aguero's second eight minutes later was more spectacular as West Brom failed to clear and he stepped away from Jonas Olsson to fire high into the top corner from 20 yards with real bluster. Aguero fires home his and Man City's second goal The second half only saw City continue to apply pressure, but Nolito got in the way of shots from both David Silva and Gundogan, the second of which looked to be going in. Having had enough of being on the back foot, Tony Pulis withdrew Darren Fletcher and Olsson for James Morrison and Jonathan Leko and the double change had a positive effect on West Brom. Pep Guardiola reflects on Manchester City's win against West Brom Pep Guardiola reflects on Manchester City's win against West Brom Suddenly they started to make chances and Salomon Rondon was unlucky to head wide after getting to Chris Brunt's teasing long ball ahead of Claudio Bravo. Jonathan Leko (left) came on for West Brom and made a difference Chadli also drove over and Brunt was on target with a free kick but his attempt was tame and with that the home side grew frustrated at still being kept out. City punished them for that as Gundogan's late brace sealed the win and boosted morale before their meeting with Barca. His first came from a sublime lifted reverse pass from Aguero, with the Germany international finishing confidently. Ilkay Gundogan scores his first goal of the game as City cruise to victory Gundogan then hit the mark again as the game moved into stoppage time, Kevin De Bruyne supplying him before he converted a fine left-footed shot.

Liverpool Crystal Palace 2-4 Liverpool Slick Liverpool kept pace at the top of the Premier League with a thrilling 4-2 victory over Crystal Palace on Saturday evening. Five of the goals came during a pulsating first half at Selhurst Park, with Emre Can opening the scoring (16) before James McArthur levelled the match within two minutes. Dejan Lovren headed the Reds back in front four minutes later before midfielder McArthur added his second, heading home just after the half-hour mark. Joel Matip headed home his first Liverpool goal in the 44th minute and Roberto Firmino added the fourth in the second half to see the visitors go 11 games unbeaten in all competitions. Liverpool's Emre Can celebrates after scoring against Crystal Palace Crystal Palace have now lost their last three games in the Premier League and remain in 12th place while Liverpool move level on points with Arsenal and Manchester City at the top of the table, Jurgen Klopp's side third only on goal difference. It took 16 minutes for the game to burst into life. Can was the first to strike after some fantastic Liverpool passing play, with Philippe Coutinho playing in Alberto Moreno on the left of the box. He took one touch to put the ball into the feet of the Germany international who fired home, the shot taking a deflection off Scott Dann on the way. Roberto Firmino celebrates with Liverpool team-mates Sadio Mane and Philippe Coutinho But two minutes later, McArthur got his first of the game as he took advantage of some shambolic Liverpool defending. Matip headed the ball low into the path of Lovren, but his touch was wild and allowed the Crystal Palace midfielder to nick in and head the ball past the onrushing Loris Karius. Lovren atoned for his mistake just after the 20-minute mark as he got ahead of Dann as a corner was delivered and headed through the legs of Steven Mandanda before Moreno rifled an effort off the crossbar not long after as the Reds searched for their third. Emre Can holds off Joel Ward at Selhurst Park But Crystal Palace were the next to strike in the 33rd minute to again get themselves level, and McArthur was on target to nab his brace, heading home from a Wilfred Zaha cross on the left-hand side. Despite the scoreline, Mandanda did well under plenty of Liverpool pressure, pushing a fierce Coutinho strike onto the crossbar before Sadio Mane fired just over the bar from close range. Joel Matip celebrates his first Liverpool goal with his team-mates Liverpool went ahead for a third time with just a minute of normal time in the half to play, as Matip nabbed his first Reds goal in style. Coutinho whipped in a cross and the Cameroon international, finding himself completely unmarked, powered a header into the back of the net to end a breathless first half. It was Crystal Palace who were the better side at the start of a quieter second period, with former Liverpool striker Christian Benteke twice forcing saves from Karius in the opening exchanges. Roberto Firmino takes the ball past Joe Ledley Mandanda continued to keep the Eagles within touching distance of a result and made a fine low stop with his feet to keep out a surging Mane before Karius was again called into action to deny Benteke after some great one-two play with Yohan Cabaye. The hosts had two penalty appeals waved away just after the hour mark as Zaha went down on the edge of the box under pressure from Lovren before Benteke was subject to a clumsy tackle from Matip, but referee Andre Marriner waved away both claims to roars from the home fans. Philippe Coutinho competes with Joel Ward during the match Liverpool sealed their victory in the 71st minute and it was the classiest of the six goals. Jordan Henderson picked out Firmino at the top of the box with a sublime through ball, and the Brazil international floated the ball over the oncoming Mandanda to add the Reds' fourth. It was Jurgen Klopp's men who were in control from then on, as the Crystal Palace goalkeeper made a fine save to twice deny Coutinho and Liverpool saw out the game to go eight matches unbeaten in the Premier League.

City, who handed starts to Vincent Kompany and Sergio Aguero, were behind in the 27th minute after John Stones' poor back pass gifted Nathan Redmond the opener. Stones thought he had redeemed himself moments later when bundling Kevin De Bruyne's free-kick into the back of the net, but it was ruled out after Aguero was adjudged to be standing in an offside position from the ball into the box. However, City were back on level terms after the break when substitute Kelechi Iheanacho, on at half-time for Kevin De Bruyne, swept home Leroy Sane's cross from close range. There was a renewed hope around the Etihad after the goal and City pushed hard for a winner right until the death, but Southampton held on for a superb point. Pep Guardiola gives orders to his side from the sidelines Following the midweek disappointment against Barcelona, Guardiola brought in the fit again Kompany for his first Premier League start of the season, while Aguero was also restored to the starting line-up as City looked to end a run of four games without a victory. However, Guardiola's side made a sluggish start in what was a subdued atmosphere. Raheem Sterling rides a tackle from Jordy Clasie Chances were few and far between in the opening 15 minutes but Fernandinho tried to drive his side forward, flashing a cross across goal and just out of the reach of Raheem Sterling. Southampton, who had settled into the game well, went forward through Tadic a few minutes later but his cross was easily gathered by Claudio Bravo. Bravo was left stranded in the 27th minute though as Stones' poor back pass allowed Redmond to steal in on goal. The winger still had plenty to do and rounded the Chilean before sliding the ball into the back of the net. Stones thought he had made up for his error four minutes later, firing De Bruyne's free-kick home, but the goal was disallowed after Aguero was ruled to be in an offside position. John Stones prepares to take a throw-in for City The frustration continued for City right up until half time as Ilkay Gundogan drove wide before Aguero's shot missed the target but Guardiola reacted at the break, bringing on Iheanacho. It brought about a change in shape for the hosts and a change of fortunes as City claimed the equaliser after 55 minutes. Fernandinho's superb long-range pass picked out Leroy Sane and his low cross was expertly finished at the near post by Iheanacho for his eighth goal in 11 games. Kelechi Iheanacho equalised for the home side Buoyed by the goal, City pushed forward at every opportunity and it was a case of backs to the wall for Saints, although Bravo was needed to keep out a powerful Charlie Austin drive. At the other end, Fraser Forster kept the scores level, palming away Gundogan's effort before saving David Silva's strike. Vincent Kompany is replaced by Jesus Navas Aguero threatened late on with a strong run into the penalty area, but the Argentina international pulled his shot across the face of goal. Guardiola sent Jesus Navas and Nolito on for Kompany and Sane late on as they desperately searched for a winner, but it was to no avail as City, who went back to the top of the table on goal difference, made it five games without a win in all competitions.

It took just 30 seconds for Chelsea to spoil Mourinho's comeback as Pedro pounced on a defensive mix-up to score the fastest Premier League goal of the season so far. Gary Cahill thumped his second goal of the season on 21 minutes, before Eden Hazard deepened Mourinho's misery with a fine 62nd-minute strike. Eden Hazard celebrates after scoring Chelsea's third goal N'Golo Kante then completed the rout with Chelsea's fourth on 70 minutes as the visitors capitulated. The victory, which moved Chelsea into the top four and left United in seventh, fittingly marked the 20th anniversary of former Chelsea vice-chairman Matthew Harding's death. Pedro takes the ball beyond David de Gea to open the scoring at Stamford Bridge Antonio Conte stuck with the same team which dispatched Leicester last week, while Jesse Lingard replaced Ashley Young in what was United's only change from Monday's draw at Liverpool. Ten months after his sacking, Chelsea's most-decorated manager received a warm welcome pre-match, but that quickly evaporated as the hosts went in front before a United player had even touched the ball. Gary Cahill and Hazard give their reaction to Sky Sports after the 4-0 win over Man Utd Gary Cahill and Hazard give their reaction to Sky Sports after the 4-0 win over Man Utd A lofted pass over the top caused hesitation between the United defence and David de Gea, allowing Pedro to capitalise and turn the ball into the unguarded net. Having been caught cold, United had the chance to level on eight minutes but Zlatan Ibrahimovic could only head Antonio Valencia's cross onto the roof of the Chelsea goal. Mourinho says that the bad start against Chelsea changed his game plan Mourinho says that the bad start against Chelsea changed his game plan Despite this, the hosts remained in firm control as Hazard volleyed wide from a corner after another defensive lapse from the visitors on 14 minutes. Chelsea soon underlined their superiority, though, Cahill escaping Chris Smalling's clutches to meet a deflected corner before clinically volleying home. Chelsea manager Antonio Conte gives his reaction to Sky Sports after his side's comprehensive win Chelsea manager Antonio Conte gives his reaction to Sky Sports after his side's comprehensive win Marcus Rashford had an attempt blocked shortly after but Manchester United remained in trouble. Pedro pinched possession from Daley Blind, before surging to the byline and firing a low cross that De Gea had to block with his legs. A minute later, Hazard's low cross almost fell for Diego Costa to make it three but somehow Eric Bailly was able to clear. Cahill celebrates after scoring Chelsea's second goal Thibaut Courtois almost invited United back into the game on 28 minutes, parrying Ander Herrera's shot into the path of Lingard, but atoned to block the rebound. The visitors were aggrieved David Luiz was shown a yellow card, rather than a red, for a high challenge on Marouane Fellaini, which would force the Belgium international off at half-time. Luiz received a yellow card for his tackle on Fellaini In the second period, Chelsea sat back and invited United forward with the intent of hitting them on the counter, a ploy which led to their third. Valencia and half-time substitute Juan Mata, also returning to his former club, failed to mark Hazard and the Belgian was given the space to weave into the area and convert low to De Gea's left. Man Utd midfielder Juan Mata says the defeat is 'painful' for his side Man Utd midfielder Juan Mata says the defeat is 'painful' for his side Three quickly became four, this time Paul Pogba and Smalling were at fault as Kante was given the freedom to roam into the area and beat a hapless De Gea.

The hosts' best chance fell to Charlie Daniels after just five minutes but Hugo Lloris - Tottenham's hero against Bayer Leverkusen in midweek - expertly tipped the defender's effort onto the bar. Spurs, who controlled 62 per cent possession and had twice as many shots as their opponents at the Vitality Stadium, hit the woodwork themselves through Erik Lamela but failed to score for the first time in the league this season. Hugo Lloris makes a great save from Charlie Daniels in the first half A fiery encounter saw referee Craig Pawson award six yellow cards, with Lamela avoiding a second booking shortly before half-time for a late tackle on Dan Gosling and Moussa Sissoko accused of elbowing Harry Arter in the second half. The draw continues Tottenham's unbeaten start to the season and they remain third in the table. Meanwhile, Bournemouth move into the top half with teams around them still to play and will be buoyed by the fact Jack Wilshere completed 90 minutes for the first time in two years. Jack Wilshere completed 90 minutes of Premier League football for the first time in two years Jack Wilshere completed 90 minutes of Premier League football for the first time in two years Eddie Howe's side, without the in-form Junior Stanislas due to a calf injury, suffered another blow in the warm-up when Andrew Surman was taken ill and replaced in the starting line-up by Gosling. Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino claims the 0-0 draw at Bournemouth is a point gained for his Spurs side Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino claims the 0-0 draw at Bournemouth is a point gained for his Spurs side And only the brilliance of Lloris prevented the hosts from taking an early lead when the Spurs 'keeper, who produced a remarkable stop from Javier Hernandez in the Champions League on Tuesday, came to Tottenham's rescue again with a fine reflex save to deny Daniels' effort via the crossbar. Eddie Howe and Mauricio Pochettino greet each other before the game Spurs, starting with Heung-Min Son up front in place of Vincent Janssen, were next to hit the woodwork as Lamela's right-footed strike from distance clipped the junction between post and bar. But the Argentina international, one of four Spurs players to collect a booking in a feisty first-half, was fortunate to stay on the pitch before the break when he escaped without a second yellow card for a lunge on Gosling. Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe claims he was happier with the performance in the 0-0 against Tottenham than the 6-1 last week against Hull Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe claims he was happier with the performance in the 0-0 against Tottenham than the 6-1 last week against Hull Spurs enjoyed the better of the play after the interval as Dele Alli tested Artur Boruc and Lamela blasted over from close range. Mauricio Pochettino introduced Janssen as the visitors went in search of the winner, but Bournemouth - who were restricted to one shot on target - frustrated their opponents. Erik Lamela was yellow carded in the first half and also hit the bar Arter was at the centre of Bournemouth's good work and the Cherries midfielder was involved in the final flashpoint of the game when Spurs substitute Sissoko appeared to catch him with an elbow late on. After consulting his assistant, referee Pawson declined to take further action and in the end Bournemouth finished the game on top. Dele Alli and Dan Gosling compete for the ball Jack Wilshere had a penalty appeal waved away following a firm challenge by Victor Wanyama, while replacement Benik Afobe headed over in stoppage time.

Middlesbrough Highlights: Arsenal 0-0 Middlesbrough Middlesbrough earned a fine point at Arsenal and could have come away with more after a 0-0 draw at the Emirates on Saturday. Boro had the better of the chances in the first half as Gaston Ramirez twice went close, while Adama Traore was kept out by Petr Cech having gone through one-on-one. Arsenal went closest through Alexis Sanchez in the first half as Victor Valdes twice kept him out, but the visitors could and perhaps should have come away with three points despite the Gunners' dominance on the ball. The result means Arsenal remain unbeaten in eight Premier League games, while Middlesbrough move out of the relegation zone with their fourth draw in nine games this term. Arsenal registered 72 per cent possession in the first half, but lacked a cutting edge as Middlesbrough hit the hosts on the counter-attack. Boro should have been 1-0 up after 20 minutes as Traore robbed Laurent Koscielny following some sloppy defending, only for Cech to block his effort from close range as he ran through on goal. Petr Cech superbly keeps out Gaston Ramirez's first-half header Ramirez then hit the post with a free-kick from 20 yards, with Cech beaten all ends up, while at the other end Alexis Sanchez forced a save out of Victor Valdes with a similar set piece. Ramirez had another fine chance to put Middlesbrough ahead later in the half, but his far post header from close range after fine play from Traore was kept out superbly by Cech. Arsenal started the second-half brightest and went close within three minutes, Sanchez seeing his poked ball across the face of goal go inches over the head of Koscielny, who was placed in front of an open goal. Sanchez then hit a free-kick inches wide of the left-hand post, before Valdes tipped wide the Chilean's fine 20-yard piledriver moments later. Alex Iwobi battles for the ball in the first half Man-of-the-match Traore then forced Cech into another fingertip save after a pacey break into to the area, while at the other end, Sanchez's weak effort from a fine position on the right was collected by Valdes. Boro could have won it at the death as Traore fed Negredo through on goal on the left of the area, but Koscielny's superb last-ditch tackle thwarted the Spaniard as he looked to move the ball onto his right foot. Mesut Ozil had a late goal correctly ruled out for offside, and Boro came away more-than deserving of a point on an unhappy 67th birthday for Arsene Wenger.

Scott Arfield escaped a red card to strike in stoppage time and give Burnley an unlikely 2-1 win over Everton at Turf Moor. Sam Vokes' opener from Maarten Stekelenburg's mistake was cancelled out by Yannick Bolasie's first Everton goal, before Arfield grabbed a remarkable winner. The Canada international was booked in the first half and given a warning before committing more fouls and not being disciplined. Despite Burnley being on the back foot for much of the game, Arfield's late effort after Johann Berg Gudmundsson hit the bar gave Sean Dyche's men their third home win of the Premier League season. The fact the Lancashire side took anything from the game at all - even a point would have been a good outcome - was notable given how much Everton dictated play at times. Ronald Koeman and Sean Dyche shake hands The Merseysiders had 65 per cent of possession and made more than double the number of chances their opponents created. Indeed, straight from the off they went on the attack, with Tom Heaton saving well from Ross Barkley, Kevin Mirallas blocked and Bolasie putting an overhead kick wide. Heaton was again called into action to deny Romelu Lukaku and Barkley once more, while interventions were needed from Michael Keane and Ben Mee to keep the score blank. Ross Barkley shoots while under pressure from Matt Lowton Arfield initially saw yellow for taking out Seamus Coleman and was then fortunate only to be told off at length by referee Mike Jones rather than dismissed when he later took out Gareth Barry. If Everton were aggrieved at that in any way, they would have been infuriated a minute later as the former Falkirk player played a significant part in Burnley going in front. Arfield burst forward from a deep midfield role with purpose but was running out of steam as he got into the box and his shot towards goal was tame. Sam Vokes of Burnley celebrates scoring his team's first goal Stekelenburg was unconvincing though as he went to save and he weakly palmed straight to Vokes, who probably couldn't believe his good fortune as he poked in to make it 1-0. Everton replied positively after the break, with Barkley kept out by Heaton and Lukaku just missing a Bolasie cross. Those two combined to draw the visitors level when Barry found Lukaku and Bolasie muscled his own team-mate off the ball to pull clear and drill a low finish into the net from 15 yards. Everton's Yannick Bolasie celebrates Everton continued to press and looked like the side who would go on to find a winner as Keane needed to touch Coleman's ball away from the lurking Lukaku. Bolasie's deliveries from wide were causing all sorts of problems too - with Heaton getting a crucial hand to one of them as Lukaku again sought to profit. Former Crystal Palace winger Bolasie's vicious long-range shot needed touched over and with that, a little bizarrely, Everton's tempo dropped and laid a platform for Burnley's winner. Burnley's Scott Arfield celebrates scoring his team's winner with his team mates during the Premier League match against Everton In the first minute of stoppage time, Gudmundsson's shot smacked off the woodwork from 20 yards and Arfield - still on the park rather than replaced for his own benefit - got the winner. His low half-volley soared past Stekelenburg and as he wheeled away in celebration, even he looked like he was surprised to have had the chance to decide the contest.

Stoke FT Hull 0 - 2 Stoke Xherdan Shaqiri scored two sensational goals to help Stoke City to a 2-0 win at Hull City. Stoke opened the scoring on 26 minutes when Shaqiri was given too much space to cut inside on to his left foot, punishing the hosts with a wonderful strike that curled into the top corner. The Potters continued to dominate after taking the lead and could have gone further ahead, with Marko Arnautovic and Joe Allen both threatening, but an impotent Hull managed to restrict the lead to just a single goal by half-time. However, it took just five minutes of the second half for Stoke to double their lead, as Shaqiri curved a sumptuous free-kick over the wall and into the bottom corner of David Marshall's net. A tactical switch from Hull saw them gain a foothold in the game after the hour mark, but it was too little, too late and Stoke left the KCOM Stadium with all three points. Xherdan Shaqiri starred for Stoke Stoke went into the game unbeaten in three matches and looking for a second win of the season to lift them out of the relegation zone. However, manager Mark Hughes would have been surprised by the ease with which his visitors took control, with Shaqiri heavily involved from the outset. For all of Stoke's attractive play, however, chances had been at a premium until the 26th minute, when the ball was worked to Shaqiri on the right. Given too much time and space to cut inside by the Hull midfielder, the Switzerland international needed no second invitation to pull the trigger, unleashing a world-class strike to beat Marshall. Hull were again at fault with the second, failing to clear their lines after dispossessing Allen and giving away a free-kick in a dangerous area. And with Shaqiri in such sparkling form, it seemed almost destined to be a second as he strode up to whip the set-piece beyond a helpless Marshall. Arnautovic could have had two goals of his own, but was twice denied by the Hull goalkeeper, although the visitors did begin to threaten after the introduction of Abel Hernandez and a switch to a back-three. Even a melee after the final whistle that led to a yellow card for Shaqiri could not ruin the diminutive playmaker's afternoon, who produced one of his best performances for Stoke to help the club reach their 100th win in the Premier League. The result also sees Stoke move out of the bottom three, leapfrogging Hull in the process.

games unbeaten at the King Power Stadium with a 3-1 victory over Crystal Palace on Saturday. Jamie Vardy was dropped to the bench and his replacement Ahmed Musa opened the scoring. Shinji Okazaki doubled the advantage for City, who had won more points in the Champions League than the Premier League before this game. Christian Fuchs celebrated signing a new three-year deal with the club by netting his first goal from the club with a fabulous 25-yard strike. Yohan Cabaye notched a late consolation for Palace, who have now lost back-to-back games and have failed to keep a clean sheet in the last 14 Premier League outings. Shinji Okazaki of Leicester enjoys his moment with his team-mates The Premier League champions left out Vardy, who was without a goal in nine games with Musa slotting in on the left wing and Islam Slimani through the middle. Scott Dann was only fit enough for the bench for Palace as they made one change to the 1-0 defeat against West Ham with Cabaye replacing the injured Jason Puncheon. The Foxes were quickly into their stride. Okazaki really should have done better on two minutes after Palace goalkeeper Steve Mandanda misplaced a pass to him but he chipped over from 25 yards. Ahmed Musa (L) celebrates with Danny Simpson That was as good as it got for the hosts in an opening 25 minutes dominated by Alan Pardew's men. The best chance fell to Christian Benteke who crashed a header against the crossbar on 13 minutes from Martin Kelly's cross. Last season's PFA Player of the Year, Riyad Mahrez, influence on the game started to grow as the half wore on and Leicester began to threaten. The winger cross-come-shot from the right flank was headed over by Okazaki on 34 minutes but the net did bulge eight minutes later. Musa found space on the edge of the area and despite having Mahrez on the overlap, he decided to go for goal and found the top corner with a crisp strike. Wes Morgan reacts after a missed chance That goal set the platform for Leicester to push after the break and they made it 2-0 on 62 minutes. An attack down the left dropped at the feet of Okazaki, who smashed a low effort into the bottom corner from 15 yards. Two became three on 79 minutes when Fuchs pinged an effort with his left-foot from 25 yards straight into the net. Cabaye went close for Palace minutes later but Kasper Schmeichel made a smart save at his near post. He was picking the ball out of the net six minutes later though when Cabaye, from a similar position as his earlier chance, flicked the ball through Robert Huth's legs and into the corner of the net. It was nothing more than a consolation as Leicester sent on Vardy with 15 minutes to go and they came close to extending their lead in injury time through Mahrez.

Swansea 0-0 Watford Bob Bradley claimed the first point of his tenure as Swansea manager with a goalless draw against Watford at the Liberty Stadium. The newly-appointed Swans boss endured a largely frustrating afternoon on his home debut as his side failed to break down a stubborn Watford rearguard. Gylfi Sigurdsson stuck the post in a frantic final half hour which saw the hosts twice denied by fine saves by Heurelho Gomes, while the visitors had two penalty appeals ignored by referee Paul Tierney. On a positive note, Swansea claimed a first home clean sheet of the season, but that was not enough to lift them out of the relegation zone. Watford, meanwhile, move up to ninth in the Premier League after their second away draw of the season. Having had another week to examine the squad at his disposal, Bradley make five changes to the Swansea side fielded at Arsenal, the most notable of which saw 22-year-old Alfie Mawson handed his Premier League debut. Bob Bradley looks to inspire his players from the touchline Walter Mazzarri, meanwhile, recalled Juan Zuniga and Odion Ighalo in place of Nordin Amrabat and the injured Isaac Success. There was almost early euphoria as Modou Barrow, fresh from his scintillating display at the Emirates Stadium, forced Gomes to tip his low effort wide on eight minutes. A cagey opening 45 then transpired, Gomes was on hand to stifle any chance the hosts had of building momentum when he saved from Sigurdsson on 23 minutes, Gylfi Sigurdsson rues a missed opportunity Barrow was Swansea's greatest threat but Watford's centre-back trio of Sebastian Prodl, Younes Kaboul and Miguel Britos prevented the winger from finding support. And Kaboul hit the opener when his 44th-minute free-kick deflected agonisingly wide of Lukasz Fabianksi's goal. The second half continued in the same vein, with chances at a premium, before both sides' desire to win caused the game to open up. Ighalo led a Watford counter on the hour, getting the better of Mawson before seeing a shot on goal blocked before Barrow went up the other end crossed for Borja Baston, who steered an effort wide. Gomes produced the save of the game on 64 minutes, thwarting Mike van der Hoorn's attempts to convert Sigurdsson's inch-perfect free-kick. Bradley introduced Fernando Llorente shortly after and the Spaniard almost had the perfect impact, lashing an effort, which took a deflection, inches over the Watford goal 18 minutes from time. Troy Deeney jumps over the challenge of Mike van der Hoorn Watford had two penalty appeals rejected in quick succession, the first for what would have been a harsh handball call before a coming together which resulted in Valon Behrami going to ground went unpunished on 77 minutes. Sigurdsson was inches away from breaking the deadlock when he ended a flowing Swansea counter by striking the outside of the post on 82 minutes. There was time for substitute Nordin Amrabat to blaze a shot on the counter over two minutes from time but the Hornets would have to settle for a point on their trip to south Wales.

It looked as though the Hammers were set for another frustrating result at their new home, with Dimitri Payet going closest to breaking the deadlock when he hit the post in the 27th minute. Wahbi Khazri missed a brilliant chance for Sunderland early in the second half, and the visitors were denied a point with almost the last kick of the match as Reid fired in from the edge of the box. The goal stood despite a question of offside and West Ham have now secured back-to-back wins for the first time this season while Sunderland remain rooted to the foot of the Premier League table with just two points to their name. Even at such an early stage of the season the Black Cats look in deep trouble, although David Moyes will be aggrieved not to have taken a point from their visit to the capital. Winston Reid scores West Ham's winner The hosts, who had only won once previously in the league at the London Stadium this season, made an enforced change with the suspended Aaron Cresswell replaced by Edimilson Fernandes. Lamine Kone and Steven Pienaar started for Sunderland, who were distinctly second best in the early stages. Payet curled an effort narrowly wide and shot at Jordan Pickford after dribbling his way into the box. West Ham also had a couple of penalty appeals waved away before Payet went even closer in the 27th minute as he opened up space with a clever dummy and then shot against the post from just inside the box. Slaven Bilic speaks to Dimitri Payet After weathering the storm, Sunderland eventually grew into the game and Jack Rodwell headed over from Khazri's free-kick. Patrick van Aanholt shot over from 20 yards before the otherwise ineffective Simone Zaza saw an overhead kick fly just wide of the post. Khazri spurned Sunderland's chance of the match early in the second half when he was played through on goal and failed to beat Adrian. Steven Pienaar tries to get away from Michail Antonio A similar opportunity presented itself to Zaza moments later but his poor first touch allowed Kone to recover. Otherwise, West Ham largely looked laboured and aside from Fernandes shooting over from the edge of the box they struggled to break down Sunderland's compact defence. It looked as though they would have to make do with a share of the spoils until the final minute when a corner was played to Reid just outside the area and his low shot went through a crowd of bodies - with a West Ham player seemingly in an offside position - and into the net.

second in the Premier League Watch highlights of Liverpool's 2-1 win against West Brom Watch highlights of Liverpool's 2-1 win against West Brom Liverpool moved up to second in the Premier League thanks to a 2-1 win against West Bromwich Albion at Anfield on Saturday evening. The Reds had appeared to be cruising towards a comfortable three points after first-half goals from Sadio Mane and Philippe Coutinho. Gareth McAuley's close-range strike with nine minutes to go then set up a nervous finish, but the hosts held on to move level on points with leaders Arsenal, with only goal difference separating the sides. The Baggies, meanwhile, drop to 13th in the table after just one away win in their last 11 league games. Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp was able to hand Adam Lallana, who came on as a substitute against Man Utd on Red Monday, a starting berth in place of Daniel Sturridge. And fellow midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum was also fit enough to take his place on the bench after recovering from the hip problem he picked up on international duty. As for the visitors, experienced centre-back Jonas Olsson replaced the suspended Jonny Evans at the back, with the Swede making his first appearance since August. The home side knew that victory by a two-goal margin would send them top of the table and unlike against United on Monday, they started as though they meant business. Liverpool's Philippe Coutinho celebrates after scoring the Reds' second goal In front of watching co-owner John W Henry, the Reds moved the ball about at pace in the opening quarter of an hour, albeit without testing Ben Foster in the Baggies goal, before opening the scoring after 20 minutes thanks to a lovely team goal. West Brom lost possession of the ball deep in Liverpool's half, allowing James Milner to break forward and find Coutinho, whose clever dummy released the marauding Emre Can. The Germany international then fed Roberto Firmino down the inside left channel, before the forward's lovely chipped ball was side-footed home by the unmarked Mane at the far post for his fourth goal of the season. Joel Matip (centre) beats Salomon Rondon to a header at Anfield A quarter of an hour later and the home side had doubled their lead, although West Brom boss Tony Pulis will not be happy with his side's part in the goal. It all started with a tricky ball back to goalkeeper Ben Foster, who then fluffed his attempted clearance, before captain Darren Fletcher was caught in possession by the ever-alert Mane. The Senegal international wasted little time in feeding Coutinho and the diminutive playmaker then cut back inside, before beating Foster at his near post with a low shot. Liverpool's Sadio Mane (right) reacts after scoring his side's first goal of the game At this stage of proceedings, Liverpool were rampant, quickest to every ball and attacking at will and Klopp's side really should have put the game out of sight after the break, only to waste a succession of chances. Foster, as he was last week against Tottenham Hotspur, was in inspired form in the visitors' goal, racing off his line to deny Firmino, before then clawing away Dejan Lovren's goalbound header just before the hour-mark. And if it was not Foster in the way, it was Olsson, with the Swede making one sensational block to prevent Can from scoring a third midway through the second period after another blistering counter by the hosts. Jordan Henderson (right) challenges for the ball with West Brom midfielder Nacer Chadli Pulis reacted by bringing on the returning Chris Brunt, James Morrison and Hal Robson-Kanu, and those changes appeared to breathe new life into the Baggies in the final quarter of the contest. It was one of those subs, Brunt, who helped bring West Brom back into the game with his sweet left foot. The Northern Ireland international firstly created a half chance for McAuley with a swinging free kick to the far post that forced Karius into a save. And from Brunt's resulting left-wing corner, Liverpool's frailties from set plays returned as the ball fell kindly at the feet of McAuley, who had the freedom of Anfield to thump the ball home from four yards out. Liverpool's Brazilian midfielder Philippe Coutinho (L) celebrates after scoring But that strike came just too late for West Brom to stage a comeback, with Liverpool hanging on for the win that sees them join Arsenal at the top of the table.

highlights of Liverpool 0-0 Man Utd Watch highlights of Liverpool 0-0 Man Utd Liverpool were held to a 0-0 draw by a stubborn Manchester United in Monday night's Premier League clash at Anfield. Goalkeeper David de Gea made two fine second-half saves from Emre Can and Philippe Coutinho to deny Liverpool the chance to move joint top of the Premier League. It was dubbed 'Red Monday', but the game was largely controlled by the away side playing in blue - and they missed a good chance to take all three points when Zlatan Ibrahimovic missed a simple second-half header. But the draw meant neither side would move up the Premier League table with Liverpool fourth and United down in seventh. Jurgen Klopp's attacking options were limited from the start as Georginio Wijnaldum missed out through injury and Adam Lallana was only fit enough to make the bench, which meant Can and Daniel Sturridge were given a chance to impress. Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp says his side were not at their best against United and were not brave enough offensively Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp says his side were not at their best against United and were not brave enough offensively Juan Mata and Jesse Lingard dropped out of the United team with Marouane Fellaini included in midfield and Ashley Young - starting a league game for the first time since January - given the nod as the left-sided attacker. Wayne Rooney was again kept in reserve. Marcus Rashford, starting on the right, avoided an early booking for a late challenge on James Milner and while the fans at the newly-expanded Anfield roared their anger at the foul, they soon quietened through frustration as their side was stifled throughout the first 45 minutes. Sadio Mane takes on Marouane Fellaini in the first half United defended deep but consistently threatened on the counter attack; almost carving out an opening when Rashford beat Milner and forced Loris Karius to push away his low cross with Ibrahimovic lurking. Roberto Firmino's 29th-minute header from Jordan Henderson's diagonal ball warmed the palms of De Gea, but that was as close as either side got to a goal before the break. Reaction from Ander Herrera and man of the match Ashley Young Reaction from Ander Herrera and man of the match Ashley Young Liverpool's nerves were frayed shortly after the interval when 23-year-old Karius sloppily kicked a back-pass straight to the feet of Paul Pogba on the edge of the area. He passed straight to Ibrahimovic and the linesman's flag spared the goalkeeper's blushes. And minutes later Ibrahimovic spurned his side's best chance of the night when he failed to head Pogba's inch-perfect cross on target with the goal at his mercy. Zlatan Ibrahimovic heads across goal when he should have scored De Gea was called into serious action for the first time on 59 minutes when Can bulldozed into the penalty area and shot through a crowd from 12 yards, forcing the United goalkeeper to push smartly away to his right. And he made an even better save 19 minutes from the end when he threw himself to his left to push away a superb 30-yard strike out of nowhere from Coutinho. Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho felt his side were in control of much of the match against Liverpool, but admits his side lacked penetration Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho felt his side were in control of much of the match against Liverpool, but admits his side lacked penetration And while De Gea will take the plaudits for those moments, his manager Jose Mourinho will surely be satisfied by a diligent team performance ahead of his return to Stamford Bridge to face Chelsea on Super Sunday. Meanwhile, Antonio Valencia's brilliant late tackle to deny the rampaging Firmino summed up a frustrating night for Liverpool, who welcome West Brom to Anfield next on Saturday evening.

hard-fought 1-0 Premier League victory over Middlesbrough on Sunday afternoon. After a goalless first half that saw Antonio Barragan escape a sending off, the midfielder curled a delightful effort into the top corner nine minutes into the second period. Middlesbrough had their chances to score and a number of penalty appeals, but remain just outside the relegation places with six points while Watford move up to tenth in the table. Both sides began the game well and had half-chances inside the opening ten minutes, with Troy Deeney nearly latching onto the end of a ball in the box before Stewart Downing skied an effort over the bar and Gaston Ramirez fired just past the far post after a one-two with Alvaro Negredo. Ben Gibson of Middlesbrough and Troy Deeney of Watford battle for possession The Valencia loanee was twice involved in penalty shouts during the opening period and in quick succession. The first came in the 24th minute when he was grappled to the ground by Younes Kaboul in the box, but referee Roger East waved away the claims. The second came just three minutes later as his shot appeared to hit the arm of Nordin Amrabat - but again nothing was given - before Downing hit wide from the rebounded ball in the box. Holebas scored the only goal of the game Middlesbrough came close to opening the scoring just after the half-hour mark as Ben Gibson collected the ball around 25 yards out and went for glory, but it fired past the upright once again. The hosts should have been reduced to 10 men just seconds later as Watford went on the break, with Barragan bringing down Issac Success in what looked a clear yellow card incident. But despite being cautioned earlier in the half, he escaped with just a talking-to from East as the first half ended goalless. Aitor Karanka says Middlesbrough lost intensity in the second half Aitor Karanka says Middlesbrough lost intensity in the second half Watford found the breakthrough just after the restart, with Holebas producing a moment of magic in the 54th minute. It came after Success went down in the area under a challenge from by Adam Forshaw and Marten de Roon's clearance found the former Greece international on the edge of the box. He then powered a fantastic effort into the top corner to put the visitors ahead. Middlesbrough continued to see penalty appeals waved away - another in the 63rd minute as Ramirez was taken down by Miguel Britos - and Barragan again brought down Success four minutes later but escaped a second yellow. The hosts' best chance of the half came in the 68th minute as Negredo rose highest to meet a Friend cross from the right but under pressure, he could not quite get it on target, allowing Heurelho Gomes to make a low save. Troy Deeney says Watford defended resolutely Troy Deeney says Watford defended resolutely Watford could have twice doubled their lead before full time, and both chances involved man of the match Success, who was making his first Hornets start since his summer move. He found himself in acres of space in front of goal, but could not quite latch onto a blocked Etienne Capoue shot. He then turned Calum Chambers into knots on the left of the box and hit a delightful curling effort, but Victor Valdes made the save. Watford managed to secure their third win of the Premier League season after another penalty call was waved away late on as Chambers was challenged by Holebas.

their unbeaten run in all competitions to seven games with a comfortable 3-1 victory over Burnley on Nissan Super Sunday. After a goalless first period, Charlie Austin's sixth (52) and seventh (66) goals of the season - either side of Nathan Redmond's fine volley (60) - put the game beyond a Burnley side who rarely threatened to cause an upset. The only blotch on an otherwise impressive display for Southampton came when Sam Vokes converted a 72nd-minute penalty - Burnley's first away goal of the season - as the hosts conceded for the first time in over 10 hours of action. Charlie Austin celebrates his opening goal against Burnley But that will have been of little significance to Claude Puel's men - who last tasted defeat on September 10 - as they moved up to eighth in the Premier League. Burnley, meanwhile, remain 14th after a fifth defeat of the season as their quest for their first points on the road continued. With Ryan Bertrand and Cedric Soares missing through injury, Southampton recalled Matt Targett and Cuco Martina, while Jordy Clasie replaced Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg in midfield. Jose Fonte battles with Michael Keane and Sam Vokes of Burnley Burnley, unchanged for the third game in succession, were boosted by Tom Heaton's return to fitness after he shook off the calf injury which saw him pull out of Gareth Southgate's England squad. And the Clarets captain was involved from the offset, producing a sensational save to tip Austin's goal-bound header around the post as the hosts started brightly. The withdrawal of Targett with a suspected hamstring injury on the quarter-hour mark dampened Southampton somewhat, with their next opening coming on 30 minutes. Fraser Forster's rushed clearance inadvertently played Dusan Tadic through on goal, but again the impenetrable Heaton kept the scorelines level. Virgil van Dijk was fortunate not to concede a penalty for a clumsy challenge on Johann Berg Gudmundsson on 33 minutes, before Southampton spurned another gilt-edged chance as Austin made a hash of his shot when played through by Tadic's exquisite pass. Nathan Redmond rifles home Southampton's second against Burnley Heaton had to be alert to keep Redmond's near-post strike out shortly before half-time, but, after Steven Defour was forced off injured, there was still time for the Saints to miss another chance as Austin failed to convert Redmond's cross home in stoppage time. Missing their midfield talisman, Burnley were helpless to prevent Southampton scoring three goals in a devastating 14-minute spell. Austin picked up the man of the match award for his two-goal cameo First, Austin bundled the ball home from close range after Van Dijk had headed a corner across the box, before Redmond rifled home a low volley on the hour-mark. After Gudmundsson was penalised for a bringing Sam McQueen to ground, Austin slotted home his second from the spot. Claude Puel says it was great to see his Southampton side enjoy themselves on the pitch after their win against Burnley Claude Puel says it was great to see his Southampton side enjoy themselves on the pitch after their win against Burnley Referee Mike Dean handed Burnley a lifeline when Tadic was penalised for blocking Ben Mee in the area, and Vokes duly obliged from the spot as Southampton saw their six-game run without conceding come to an end. But there was to be no Burnley comeback as Southampton saw out an impressive victory, which would have been even more comfortable had it not been for the fine form of Heaton.

Leicester Chelsea cruised to a 3-0 win over Leicester City in the Premier League on Saturday with Diego Costa, Eden Hazard and Victor Moses on target. Costa volleyed home his seventh league goal of the season after slack Leicester marking at a corner, and Hazard made Chelsea's first-half dominance count at Stamford Bridge with their second on 33 minutes. The visitors, who were second best in the first half, improved after the break and nearly got back into the match when David Luiz turned a Marc Albrighton cross onto his own post. Eden Hazard scored Chelsea's second at Stamford Bridge But Moses made the game safe for Chelsea in the 80th minute, latching onto Nathaniel Chalobah's back-heel and tucking past Kasper Schmeichel. Antonio Conte had rubbished speculation over his future at Stamford Bridge after a three-match winless league run in September, and it was a fine performance from his side that will go some way to quietening those rumours further. Antonio Conte was pleased with the intensity Chelsea used during their 3-0 win over Leicester at the Bridge Antonio Conte was pleased with the intensity Chelsea used during their 3-0 win over Leicester at the Bridge Meanwhile Leicester, who failed to register a shot on target, have become the first reigning champions since Blackburn Rovers to lose all four of their opening away games the following season. They face Copenhagen next and ahead of Tuesday's Champions League tie, Claudio Ranieri dropped Riyad Mahrez and Islam Slimani to the bench as part of three changes from the goalless draw against Southampton. John Terry returned to the Chelsea squad as a substitute after more than a month out with an ankle injury, and the Blues were quickly on the front foot. Claudio Ranieri felt that defensive mistakes cost Leicester in their 3-0 defeat to Chelsea Claudio Ranieri felt that defensive mistakes cost Leicester in their 3-0 defeat to Chelsea Their opponents, who conceded three times from corners against Man Utd, suffered again at a set-piece when Costa fired Chelsea in front after seven minutes. The striker, who escaped the attention of Wes Morgan, struck first-time past Schmeichel from Nemanja Matic's near-post flick. Luiz saw a trademark free-kick rattle the woodwork in a one-sided first half and Chelsea added a deserved second through Hazard just after the half-hour mark. Luis Hernandez and Robert Huth failed to clear a through ball, allowing Pedro to put Hazard on goal, and the Belgian skipped around Schmeichel to double the hosts' lead. Hazard rounds Kasper Schmeichel to score Chelsea's second against Leicester Both teams had penalty appeals waved away early in the second half, and Leicester were nearly rewarded for their bright opening when Luiz struck the post at the wrong end, the ball bouncing fortuitously clear to preserve Thibaut Courtois' clean sheet. Ranieri attempted to press the issue and introduced Mahrez and Slimani, but any momentum his team had gathered soon ebbed away. Marc Albrighton of Leicester (left) puts pressure on Chelsea's Victor Moses N'Golo Kante almost capped a man-of-the-match performance against his old club with his first Chelsea goal, but former team-mate Morgan blocked his goal-bound effort. And shortly before Chelsea's third, Costa bizarrely appeared to call for his own substitution, only to be waved away by Conte. The Spaniard, who would have missed next Sunday's meeting with Man Utd - live on Sky Sports - had he picked up his fifth booking of the season, was extremely animated and Conte confirmed after the match he ignored Costa's request. The hosts did make it three with 10 minutes to play through Moses, moving them up to fifth in the table ahead of next Sunday's clash with former boss Jose Mourinho.

American Bob Bradley, taking charge of Swansea for the first time, found his new side two goals down inside 33 minutes with Theo Walcott (26, 33) capitalising on defensive errors to grab both goals. However, the visitors were back in the game five minutes later when Granit Xhaka gifted Gylfi Sigurdsson possession, and the Iceland international produced a superb finish to hand his side a lifeline going into the break. Arsenal's two-goal advantage was restored by Mesut Ozil in the 57th minute but Swansea responded again through substitute Borja Baston within nine minutes, before Xhaka was shown a straight red card for a cynical challenge on Modou Barrow. Theo Walcott celebrates scoring his side's first goal It left Arsenal hanging on in the last 20 minutes as Barrow and Leroy Fer both headed glorious opportunities straight at Petr Cech, but Arsene Wenger's side held firm to move up to second and level on points with league leaders Manchester City.

It was a pattern that continued throughout the first half with Swansea looking to counter at every possible opportunity and it nearly worked when Fer found space on the edge of the Arsenal penalty area, but his shot flew high over the crossbar. Swansea City manager Bob Bradley However, Arsenal's dominance eventually told though in the 26th minute as Hector Bellerin headed Alexis Sanchez's pass across goal where Jordi Amat dwindled on possession, allowing Walcott to nip in and put Arsenal in front from close range. The England forward doubled the advantage seven minutes later and it was another defensive error, this time from Fernandez at a corner, as Walcott capitalised with another close range finish. Swansea pulled one back after 38 minutes as Xhaka gave the ball straight to Sigurdsson, who took full advantage of the Switzerland international's error, curling the ball beyond Cech and into the far corner. Hector Bellerin in action for Arsenal in action against Swansea City at the Emirates Stadium The goal seemed to galvanise the visitors and Sigurdsson had another opportunity just three minutes later, however, the Iceland international could only steer Modou Barrow's cross wide.

But the third goal was not long in coming as Sanchez found Ozil free at the back post and the Germany international, who was celebrating his 28th birthday, hammered a volley past Fabianski. Theo Walcott of Arsenal celebrates after doubling his tally against Swansea Bradley's side continued to show fight though and substitute Borja swept home Barrow's low cross, before the Gambia winger was tripped cynically from behind by Xhaka, who was given his marching orders for the foul. Walcott was inches away from securing the points in the 84th minute but was denied a hat-trick when his shot came back off the inside of the post before he blazed over from eight yards in stoppage time.

Goals from Charlie Daniels, Steve Cook and Junior Stanislas saw the home side go in 3-1 up at half-time, with Ryan Mason's deflected shot the only saving grace for Hull. But the game became even more one-sided after the break as the Cherries turned on the style, picking off their visitors time and again and adding three further goals through Stanislas, Callum Wilson and substitute Dan Gosling. Hull went into the game boosted by the news of a permanent deal for manager Phelan, who had taken charge of the club's initial seven games on a caretaker basis.

Bournemouth's Junior Stanislas (centre) celebrates after scoring his side's fourth goal against Hull The Cherries dominated the opening half hour of the game, with Jordon Ibe involved throughout. The ex-Liverpool winger tormented the visitors with his pace and trickery down the left flank, teeing up Wilson to hit the woodwork with an excellent cut-back and going close on a number of occasions himself.

Robert Snodgrass, who should have already been booked, then lunged in to give away a penalty before the break, which Stanislas dispatched with aplomb into the roof of the net. Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe recorded his best top-flight result Hull had half-time to regroup, but it was a case of more of the same after the interval, with the Cherries still rampant. Stanislas grabbed his second of the afternoon on 65 minutes to effectively seal the win, but it got worse for the beleaguered visitors late on as Wilson and Gosling added gloss to the scoreline. The lively Ibe went off midway through the half, as did Arsenal loanee Jack Wilshere, who quietly dominated the game in a central midfield performance that suggested he could be on the way back towards his best.

De Bruyne and Aguero - who started the game on the bench - were the culprits from the spot and Everton made the most of their goalkeeper's brilliance by taking the lead through Romelu Lukaku (64). Nolito equalised (72) within a minute of coming off the bench before Stekelenburg pushed a stunning late De Bruyne effort onto the post as Pep Guardiola lost his 100 per cent home record as City manager. Nolito celebrates after scoring City's equaliser Despite dropping points for the second game in a row, City remain top of the Premier League - but only on goal difference ahead of Arsenal. Guardiola reacted to the defeat at Tottenham by shuffling his pack and his formation. He made six changes to the team with Raheem Sterling and De Bruyne returning from injury in a 3-5-1-1 formation. John Stones, who joined from Everton for £50m in the summer, started against his former club. Kelechi Iheanacho replaced Aguero as the lone striker but struggled to make his mark in the opening stages as Everton centre-backs Phil Jagielka and Ashley Williams defended with great authority. Ronald Koeman greets Pep Guardiola as two former Barcelona teammates meet in the dugout City looked threatening down the channels, especially through Leroy Sane, who had a penalty appeal turned down on 11 minutes when he tricked his way past Bryan Oviedo but the referee remained unmoved. Everton's rugged defence was summed up by Seamus Coleman on 31 minutes when he thundered into a late challenge on Sterling catching the England winger on the ankle. No card was shown, much to the annoyance of the players and home supporters. Pep Guardiola gives his reaction to Sky Sports after his side drew 1-1 with Everton.

Lukaku celebrates after scoring for Everton De Bruyne, who had been dictating the play from midfield, stepped up by his right-footed penalty was palmed away by Stekelenburg. City were made to rue for that wasted opportunity on 64 minutes as Everton countered with devastating effect. Stones misjudged a long ball and Lukaku pounced, taking on Gael Clichy on the outside before reversing a shot into the far corner. The Toffees now had something to hold onto, but shot themselves in the foot for the second time when Jagielka hauled down substitute Aguero, who had replaced Iheanacho.

The midfielder - a doubt before the game after picking up an injury on international duty with Wales - headed home from a great Marko Arnartovic cross just eight minutes in and added another in first-half injury time, firing home from the edge of the box. Sunderland offered little in response, and remain bottom of the Premier League table with two points while Stoke climb one place to 18th. The hosts were ahead inside eight minutes with Allen's first of the afternoon. It was a delightful initial ball from Xherdan Shaqiri to find Arnautovic, who picked the Welshman out in the box for his fifth goal in four games for club and country. Joe Allen scored both goals as Stoke saw off Sunderland at the Bet365 Stadium Jermain Defoe went closest for the visitors in their limited first-half openings, with Ryan Shawcross getting ahead of him in the 17th minute to clear a Wahbi Khazri cross before the former England striker wriggled into space nine minutes later - but could only fire over the crossbar. The Potters looked the more likely to add a second before the break, with Wilfried Bony turning away from Papy Djilbodji before firing past the post before the impressive Arnautovic poked a great cross from the Ivory Coast striker just out of play while one-on-one with Jordan Pickford.

But it was Allen who extended the lead with his second in the first minute of added time at the end of the first half, collecting a Shawcross header at the top of the box and hitting hard and low through a crowd and into the back of the net. Jermain Defoe cut a frustrated figure for Sunderland at the Bet365 Stadium Stoke could have had a third seven minutes into the second half as Pickford was forced into a fine save from Bony after a great cut-back from Erik Pieters, before Djilbodji blocked the follow up from Allen at close range to deny him his hat-trick. Bony was again a spearhead in attack two minutes later as he got away from his defender, but took his shot too early and it flew over the bar. There were a few glimpses from Sunderland although they rarely threatened with Shawcross again keeping Defoe at bay from a Duncan Watmore cross before the youngster raced forward on the break but hit high and wide.

Adam was involved again 10 minutes later when he picked up the ball in the middle of the park and went on a little run before firing towards goal, but it smashed the upright.

Lanzini put West Ham ahead in the first half with a sweeping finish inside the area, before Christian Benteke missed a penalty and hit the post with a header on the stroke of half-time. Aaron Cresswell was sent off with 15 minutes remaining after picking up two bookings within a minute, but West Ham held on for a vital win. Christian Benteke hits his penalty wide of the right-hand post It leaves West Ham 15th in the Premier League with seven points from eight games, while Palace are in eighth, four points above the Hammers. In the pouring rain at Selhurst Park, West Ham dominated the opening stages, and were ahead on 19 minutes. Manuel Lanzini celebrates scoring the opening goal with Aaron Cresswell After exchanging passes with Dimitri Payet on the left wing, Cresswell's superb centre was swept home by Lanzini from six yards, after the Argentine ghosted into the area unmarked. Palace struggled to claw their way back into the game until a frantic final few minutes of the first-half, the hosts winning a penalty after Angelo Ogbonna had brought down Benteke in the area. Dimitri Payet of West Ham United goes past Crystal Palace's Jason Puncheon The Belgian, who scored a hat-trick in midweek against Gibraltar, stepped up, but nonchalantly stroked his penalty wide of the top right corner. Benteke almost made amends instantly, but his towering header from a right-wing cross came off the outside of Adrian's right-hand post. Palace goalkeeper Steve Mandanda thwarted Payet after the break from close range as Lanzini's good work set up the Frenchman inside the area, before Michail Antonio's close-range header from a corner was cleared off the line by Jason Puncheon. Manuel Lanzini celebrates scoring the opening goal with Aaron Cresswell Cresswell then got the first of his bookings for simulation after going down easily under Yohan Cabaye's tackle in the area, and barely a minute later was harshly shown a second yellow for pulling back Wilfried Zaha on the right wing. Benteke should have brought Palace level with 10 minutes remaining, heading over the bar from Puncheon's fine ball, and Adrian was at his best to deny substitute Conor Wickham's close-range header at the far post in stoppage time.

late to cancel out an Anthony Martial strike and grab a 1-1 draw for Stoke against Manchester United at Old Trafford. United, who spurned a plethora of good chances throughout the game, finally made the breakthrough when Martial came off the bench to score on 69 minutes. But absent-minded defending with eight minutes left allowed Allen to pounce on a Jonathan Walters cross that was deflected onto the crossbar and earn the Premier League's bottom side a point, Jose Mourinho's men now with just one league win in their last four. Both sides remained unchanged with Wayne Rooney, who impressed in the Europa League win on Thursday, starting on the United bench for the third successive time. Zlatan Ibrahimovic grabbed the winner against Zorya and he should have taken the lead with his seventh goal of the season when he was fed into the penalty area by Paul Pogba in just the first minute, but he dragged a low shot towards the near post. His effort was saved by the impressive Lee Grant, who made a string of good stops to keep the visitors - still without a win this season - firmly in the game at the interval. Anthony Martial curled home an excellent opener for United on 69 minutes Pogba missed the target completely with two excellent opportunities, the first a shot inside the box before an unmarked header from a corner, while Grant - making only his second top-flight appearance - tipped Juan Mata's cheeky chip over the bar. Geoff Cameron had Stoke's best chance before the break, shooting tamely into the hands of David de Gea from the impressive Allen's cut-back. And a lovely flowing move from Stoke found Allen in the box early in the second period, but the midfielder shot tamely at De Gea himself after shimmying past the last defender. Joe Allen scored an 83rd minute equaliser for the visitors, who remain winless With United and Mourinho growing increasingly frustrated, Rooney and Martial were introduced on 67 minutes and had an immediate effect as Martial found Rooney before Cameron's interception provided the Frenchman with a first-time scoop into the far corner. Potters 'keeper Grant continued to deny red shirts, saving well from Rooney and then Daley Blind, who was the man arguably at fault for allowing Stoke back into the game. The left-back lazily hashed a clearance out for a throw in the defensive third, and United were caught napping as Bruno Martins Indi burst forward. He saw his shot parried by De Gea to Walters, who clipped the ball up off the crossbar for Allen to smash home, former United man Mark Hughes's Stoke leaving Old Trafford with a point for the first time in 36 years.

"Leicester 0-0 Southampton Leicester 0-0 Southampton Leicester's stuttering defence of their Premier League title goes on after they were held to a 0-0 draw by Southampton. The visitors had the best chances at the King Power Stadium and dictated play at times, with Charlie Austin hitting the post in the first half. Indeed, Claude Puel's men will have been frustrated at not taking all three points from a lively affair in which they played the more purposeful football. Southampton draw level on points with West Brom, while Leicester move up one place above Bournemouth to 12th but have now won only two of their opening seven league games. The away side started with intent and applied good pressure from the off, with Austin, in particular, a commanding presence in attack. Oriol Romeu and Jamie Vardy battle for possession at the King Power Stadium With caretaker England manager Gareth Southgate in the stands ahead of his first squad announcement, Austin presented a good case for inclusion after five goals in four games. A long ball over the top of defence released him and he shot from a wide angle on the right, seeing his attempt come back off the woodwork with Kasper Schmeichel beaten. Along with Austin, Cedric Soares was an integral part of Southampton's good forward play in the early stages but the Portugal defender had to go off with an ankle injury. Wes Morgan wins a header as Leicester grind out a 0-0 draw with Southampton His collision with Marc Albrighton brought his match to an end early and with that came a dip in pace from the visitors. Leicester almost exploited it as a short passback from Virgil van Dijk let in Jamie Vardy and he homed in on goal. His England team-mate Fraser Forster stood up well, however, delaying the forward enough for Southampton to get men back and block. Islam Slimani was then denied on the follow up, with Vardy also stopped once more - and he will have rued his lack of conviction because he should have put the hosts ahead. The first half was entertaining without having many clear cut chances and Slimani's biggest contribution was his combative approach in attack. He felt he should have had a penalty when he and Jose Fonte came together in the box but his claims were swiftly dismissed. Gareth Southgate watches the game from the stands ahead of naming his first England squad As the break approached, Southampton came forward again and Dusan Tadic nearly curled in but his cross was too deep and it dropped just over the bar. The Serbian should have done better after the restart as Puel's side dictated for a spell but he wasted an opportunity after Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg's through ball. Instead of shooting himself, he tried to pick out Austin and it was the wrong choice, as was Austin's own decision to try to chip Schmeichel moments later as he closed the attacker down and saved. Cedric Soares had to go off in the first half with an ankle problem Play opened up and the teams traded shots which were all comfortably held, Danny Drinkwater on target but failing to score for Leicester and Hojbjerg doing the same for Southampton. Leicester looked most likely to score towards the end, first through Shinji Okazaki's glancing header which dropped just wide of the far post. Leonardo Ulloa also had a glorious chance to win it seconds from the end after a flowing move orchestrated by Riyad Mahrez but he blazed over the bar.

Manchester City at White Hart Lane Tottenham inflicted Pep Guardiola's first defeat at Manchester City as they moved to within one point of the leaders with a scintillating 2-0 victory on Sunday. Spurs got off to a flying start at White Hart Lane, taking the lead on nine minutes after Aleksandar Kolarov put through his own net before Dele Alli slotted a slick second seven minutes before half-time. City, who trailed for the first time under Guardiola in the Premier League, rallied after the interval but struggled to replicate the form that had guided them to six top-flight wins from six beforehand. In fact, things could have been worse for City had Erik Lamela not seen his second-half penalty saved by Claudio Bravo. In the end, it proved immaterial as Spurs held on to secure their best start to a league campaign since 1960/61, asserting their own title credentials as they left Guardiola to mull over his first league defeat since March. Dele Alli celebrates scoring Tottenham's second goal at White Hart Lane Pochettino, who claimed his first managerial victory at Espanyol against Guardiola's Barcelona, brought Danny Rose and Lamela back into the fold against a City side without the injured Kevin de Bruyne. Guardiola turned to Jesus Navas to plug the gap left by the Belgian, and, after a blistering start from Spurs, the Spaniard's driven cross was almost turned home by David Silva after four minutes but it deflected wide. Undeterred, Spurs continued to harass and hound the City defence and they got their rewards shortly after as Rose's wicked cross from the left was sliced into the back of the net by Kolarov. Tottenham's players celebrate taking the lead at White Hart Lane One so nearly became two a minute later as Son forced Bravo into action at his near post before Christian Eriksen continued to apply the pressure from the hosts, whistling a free-kick marginally wide on 20 minutes. Jan Vertonghen's risky challenge in the area on Sergio Aguero went unpunished by referee Andre Marriner shortly after, but the City striker would soon test Hugo Lloris, forcing the Frenchman to tip his curling free-kick out on the half-hour mark. But, on 37 minutes, City's quest for the second goal of the game was eclipsed by Spurs as they doubled their advantage. Dele Alli scores for Tottenham The three-pronged attack of Heung-Min Son, Lamela and Alli split the City defence and, having seen Son fortunately regather possession, the South Korean slipped his England counterpart through on goal for their second. Spurs started the second period intent on not letting a City side, who have never won a Premier League game having been two or more goals down at half-time, back into the contest. Victor Wanyama ensured Bravo was alert to stop his rasping drive on 48 minutes, but City remained a threat as Aguero saw an effort deflect onto the frame of the Spurs goal via the legs of Lloris. Son Heung-Min and Erik Lamela dispute who should take a penalty kick for Tottenham Spurs had the chance to wrap up game on 65 minutes when Alli was sent tumbling in the area by Fernandinho but, after a heated debate with Son over who should take the penalty, Bravo tipped Lamela's spot-kick away. A pulsating encounter soon switched to one of attrition as a dogged Spurs rearguard withstood a late onslaught from City. But on the rare occasions their defence was breached, Lloris was on hand to deny substitute Kelechi Iheanacho and Aguero as Spurs saw out a deserved victory and closed in on their opponents.

The ball hits Koscielny's hand before dropping over the line for Arsenal's late winner Alexis Sanchez went closest for the visitors in a game lacking in chances, forcing a good save out of Tom Heaton before volleying just wide from a corner in the second half, while Michael Keane hit the woodwork for Burnley from a header.

Arsene Wenger credited his Arsenal team for fighting until the end Arsene Wenger credited his Arsenal team for fighting until the end Petr Cech came back into Wenger's starting XI for David Ospina in the only change for either side, but Arsenal's outfield players struggled to break down Burnley in the first half.

Arsene Wenger waves to fans prior to kick-off at Turf Moor At the other end, Sam Vokes beat Arsenal's offside trap from Matthew Lowton's curled ball, but the striker should have done better as his unmarked header went half a yard wide of Cech's left-hand post. Sanchez came close again early in the second half, forcing a good low save out of Tom Heaton at the near post having turned after some pinball inside Burnley's area.

Leroy Fer gave Swansea the lead with a simple close-range finish early on, and Swansea should have been further ahead in the first half, but Borja Baston's two unmarked headers were off target. Liverpool's pressure either side of half-time took its toll on Swansea as Roberto Firmino headed the visitors level from 10 yards on 54 minutes.

three-game winless streak in the Premier League with an assured 2-0 victory at Hull City on Saturday. Two goals in seven second-half minutes from Willian (61) and Diego Costa (67) put the game beyond the hosts as Antonio Conte's men ended a miserable September on a high note. The result condemns Hull to a fourth defeat in their last five top-flight games, while the Tigers remain without a win against Chelsea in nine Premier League meetings. After drawing against Swansea and losing to Liverpool and Arsenal, a much-needed win at the KCOM Stadium moves the Blues up to sixth in the table on 13 points. Hull lie down in 15th on seven points. Mike Phelan admitted his intention of freshening things up after four games without a win, and handed Dieumerci Mbokani, Markus Henriksen and David Meyler starts ahead of kick-off. A similar message came from the Chelsea camp as Conte demanded a response from Saturday's heavy loss at Arsenal, but it was the hosts who made the brighter start. Diego Costa celebrates scoring Chelea's second at Hull Having shipped three goals at the Emirates Stadium, Thibaut Courtois had to be alert on three minutes to tip Robert Snodgrass' deflected free-kick from under his crossbar. Hull looked to expose David Luiz's defensive frailties early on but Mbokani's heavy touch prevented the Tigers from capitalising on the Brazilian's poor positioning on seven minutes. It took Chelsea around 20 minutes to settle into the game, but, once up to pace, their attack began to cause the hosts problems. Dieumerci Mbokani of Hull City and David Luiz of Chelsea battle for possession Victor Moses, keen to impress after demanding a spot in Conte's starting XI, was unfortunate not to win a penalty on 25 minutes when Adama Diomande's trip went unpunished by referee Antony Taylor. An even first half ended with a flurry of chances, but neither Costa nor Ryan Mason could convert for either side as they went in at the break level. Chelsea wrestled the initiative immediately in the second half, committing greater numbers forward more frequently and creating chances. Eden Hazard of Chelsea in action during their Premier League game at Hull First, having rounded the on-rushing David Marshall, Costa saw Jake Livermore deflect his goal-bound shot onto post on 58 minutes, before N'Golo Kante blazed the rebound over. The pressure soon told though as Costa found Willian in space on the left three minutes later, and the Brazilian cut inside to fire high past Marshall, who was rooted to his spot. Chelsea continued to ask questions of the Hull defence and one quickly became two as Costa ruthlessly replicated Willian's finish after Nemanja Matic's shot was deflected into his path. William celebrates after opening the scoring at Hull From that point on it was a case of how many Chelsea could get as they pilled forward in the knowledge Hull couldn't hurt them on the counter. But, to their credit, Hull, marshalled by captain Curtis Davies, stood firm as only a late Pedro chance came close to extending the visitors' lead.

David Moyes' side are still searching for their first Premier League win of the campaign but the solitary point was enough to take them off the bottom, at least until Stoke play on Sunday. West Brom are up a place to ninth but will be disappointed they could not hold on for the win, having taken the lead through Nacer Chadli in the first half. The struggling hosts made a bright start at the Stadium of Light and put together a neat passing move in the third minute, only for the usually reliable Jermain Defoe to pull his shot wide with just the keeper to beat, after latching onto Duncan Watmore's through-ball. Patrick van Aanholt celebrates his late equaliser Sunderland continued to see plenty of possession but their attacks foundered on the well-organised West Brom defence, as the visitors looked to soak up pressure before countering. It was a strategy which worked well and Chadli drew a decent save from Jordan Pickford after Matt Phillips had pulled the ball back. David Moyes says his Sunderland team didn't deserve to lose as they scored late on to deny West Brom all three points at the Stadium of Light. David Moyes says his Sunderland team didn't deserve to lose as they scored late on to deny West Brom all three points at the Stadium of Light. The same combination then combined to even better effect in the 35th minute, Claudio Yacob winning a crucial tackle in midfield before freeing Phillips who in turn picked out Chadli in the inside-left channel. The Belgian still had plenty to do but a delightful first touch took him away from Lamine Kone before he guided a lovely finish into the corner of the net. Duncan Watmore powers forward for Sunderland The lead could have been doubled before the break but James McClean could not match Chadli from a similar position, screwing his shot wide, admittedly under pressure from a defender. Sunderland huffed and puffed in the second half but appeared worryingly reliant on Defoe for any sort of goal threat. The experienced England man produced one sumptuous turn but was then crowded out by defenders in the box, and also had a seemingly goal-bound shot brilliantly blocked by Jonny Evans. Tony Pulis says his West Brom needed the second goal to kill the game off after Sunderland's Patrick van Aanholt earned them a draw late on. Tony Pulis says his West Brom needed the second goal to kill the game off after Sunderland's Patrick van Aanholt earned them a draw late on. That chance was created by Wahbi Khazri, after a brilliant pass from Van Aanholt, who was somewhat surprisingly omitted from the starting line-up but emerged in the second-half after Jan Kirchhoff picked up a knock. And it was Van Aanholt who saved the Black Cats with a goal out of the blue, having initiated the attack himself with a pass to Watmore. The young forward had worked tirelessly all day and did superbly here, powering into the box down the left and then flicking the ball into the path of Van Aanholt, who managed to place a bouncing shot into the top of the net. West Brom boss Tony Pulis greets Sunderland counterpart David Moyes ahead of kick-off Sunderland goalkeeper Pickford had earlier made important saves to keep out a Darren Fletcher piledriver and a good effort from Salomon Rondon, which he blocked at the near post. And both sides continued to attack as the game opened up after the equaliser, Rondon heading over while Defoe shot just wide from distance with virtually the final kick of a decent encounter in the north-east. No further goals meant Van Aanholt's leveller was the key moment, capping an eventful few weeks for the Dutchman, who was withdrawn from the team minutes before kick-off at Tottenham on the advice of a cardiologist, before a photo emerged of the 26-year-old apparently smoking a shisha pipe.

The summer signing from Granada steered a header into the far corner on 65 minutes after fellow second-half substitute Josh King had beaten two players and smashed a low shot home to restore the Cherries' lead. The visitors had gone ahead during an impressive first-half display when Callum Wilson stole in front of his marker and flicked Junior Stanislas' cross through Heurelho Gomes' clumsy handling (31). Troy Deeney made it 1-1 just after half-time with a side-foot finish and Jack Wilshere twice hit the post after the break, the second effort of which he should have scored from close range. Watford, beaten away at Burnley in their previous Premier League fixture, made two enforced changes in defence and switched to a back four, with Younes Kaboul and Camilo Zuniga coming in.

Wilshere could have set up Wilson for a second soon after but misplaced his pass with Bournemouth two-v-one in the counter-attack, but the striker wasted a chance of his own when he teed up Andrew Surman instead of shooting himself just before half-time.

Ham 1-1 Middlesbrough West Ham 1-1 Middlesbrough A brilliant solo goal from Dimitri Payet salvaged a point for West Ham as they and Middlesbrough both ended losing runs with a 1-1 draw. Cristhian Stuani's header early in the second half (51) put the visitors in front but a wonderful mazy run and finish from Frenchman Payet soon sftare (57) brought the sides level again. From there, neither side looked like finding a winner and the ensuing stalemate did little to improve their recent records. Both stay in the bottom five, with West Ham remaining in the relegation zone, and the two teams are still looking back to August 21 for their last league victories. The first half had all the hallmarks of a fixture between two sides struggling for form, with each tentative initially and then lacking a cutting edge when they eventually caught sight of goal. Sam Byram leaves the field on a stretcher after just a few minutes of the match with Middlesbrough West Ham suffered an early setback when Sam Byram had to go off with an apparent hamstring injury and he was replaced by Alvaro Arbeloa. They took time to settle after that, with Middlesbrough having the only chance of note in the first 20 minutes when Viktor Fischer drove across goal and just wide. Slaven Bilic says he's happy his West Ham side have picked up a point at home to Middlesbrough but is disappointed it wasn't all three as they drew 1-1. Slaven Bilic says he's happy his West Ham side have picked up a point at home to Middlesbrough but is disappointed it wasn't all three as they drew 1-1. The hosts eventually responded, with Payet having one attempt blocked by Calum Chambers then curling another wide before Michail Antonio's header was also deflected away. After James Collins headed off target on his 250th Premier League appearance, Middlesbrough finally began to settle into the contest. While they came forward more, however, they were wasteful in possession and too many crosses were being cut out, with Stewart Downing's free-kick also going straight into the wall. Payet had two chances in the first half before netting in the second Mark Noble tried to drive West Ham in front, placing one 20-yard attempt just wide of Victor Valdes' goal before he hit the bar with another shot from just inside the area. That was the best opening yet but the hosts could have been behind at the break through slack goalkeeping from Adrian. He was hesitant coming for a long ball upfield and Jordan Rhodes improvised by lifting the ball over his own head and goalwards but it was cut out in plenty of time and it remained goalless. George Friend is fouled by Pedro Obiang, earning the West Ham player a yellow card Adrian was again slow coming off his line to block Rhodes after the restart and that was the precursor to Middlesbrough's opener. From the resulting corner, Stuani got up highest to meet Fischer's cross and he headed over the line before Noble could clear, with goal line technology confirming he has scored. West Ham needed a quick response and when they got it five minutes later, it was stunning as a wonderful solo effort from Payet made it 1-1. Aitor Karanka reflects on Middlesbrough's 1-1 draw with West Ham and is glad they've ended a run of three straight defeats. Aitor Karanka reflects on Middlesbrough's 1-1 draw with West Ham and is glad they've ended a run of three straight defeats. He picked up the ball on the touchline and went past his marker into the box but had little else on with a number of defenders still ahead of him. Undeterred, he kept going across the six-yard line past a second, third, fourth and fifth before sending an angled short back across goal from right to left under Valdes and in. The relief around the London Stadium was tangible but rather than use a special moment as a springboard to victory, West Ham failed to build. Payet went past five men before scoring beyond Victor Valdes to make it 1-1 Indeed, Payet himself was lacklustre with a free-kick he lifted into the wall when you sensed many in the ground expected him to strike again. Gaston Ramirez lacked bend on his curled effort as he tried to find a late winner for Middlesbrough while Antonio wasted a chance at the other end after doing well to hold off George Friend. In the end, the draw was fair but it will do little to lift confidence in a pair of squads who look fragile at present and struggling for a spark.

Crystal Palace Watch highlights of Everton 1-1 Crystal Palace Romelu Lukaku and Christan Benteke scored as Crystal Palace came from behind to draw 1-1 at Everton on Friday Night Football. Lukaku gave the hosts the lead with a 35th-minute free-kick, but Benteke replied with a brilliant header shortly after half-time. Damien Delaney thought he had put Palace ahead on the hour mark, only to see the flag go up for offside after he headed past Maarten Stekelenburg. Romelu Lukaku scored a first-half free-kick The draw sees Everton move up to third in the Premier League ahead of the rest of the weekend's action. Palace, meanwhile, extend their unbeaten league run to five matches and might be aggrieved not to have taken all three points after having the better of the second half. Both sides made one change from their previous game, with Tom Cleverley replacing Kevin Mirallas for Everton and Wilfried Zaha coming in for Yohan Cabaye for Palace. Reaction from Damien Delaney and man of the match Christian Benteke after Crystal Palace's 1-1 draw at Everton Reaction from Damien Delaney and man of the match Christian Benteke after Crystal Palace's 1-1 draw at Everton With interim England manager Gareth Southgate watching from the stands, Zaha looked to make an early impression against Everton's second-choice left-back Bryan Oviedo. Yannick Bolasie also threatened at the other end against his former side, but both teams struggled to create clear chances in a cagey first half. Christian Benteke argues with Phil Jagielka at the full-time whistle When the deadlock was broken in the 35th minute, Palace had cause for complaint as Phil Jagielka appeared to handle the ball before Damien Delaney was penalised for a high boot. Lukaku made the most of the opportunity as he curled the free-kick over the wall, which did not jump, and into the net. Palace struck back quickly after the break thanks to a brilliant header from Benteke, who nodded into the corner and beyond the reach of Stekelenburg. Palace manager Alan Pardew felt two key decisions went against his side in the 1-1 draw at Everton Palace manager Alan Pardew felt two key decisions went against his side in the 1-1 draw at Everton Everton almost regained the lead when Bolasie cut back for Idrissa Gueye, but his close-range shot was blocked by Delaney. From then on it was Palace who created the better chances. They thought they had gone ahead when Delaney headed home, only for the flag to go up for offside, seemingly against James McArthur, who ran towards goal after the ball had been directed goalwards. Everton manager Ronald Koeman was happy with his side's much improved performance against Crystal Palace and admits it's a good point Everton manager Ronald Koeman was happy with his side's much improved performance against Crystal Palace and admits it's a good point James Tomkins then should have done better when he failed to test Stekelenburg with a close-range effort.

Both players scored their first-ever Premier League goals for the Clarets with headers from Steven Defour corners either side of half-time. As a result, Burnley have moved up to 13th in the table, while Watford remain in 11th. Sean Dyche made two changes from the side that lost 3-0 at Leicester City last time out, with Sam Vokes and Johann Berg Gudmundsson coming in for the suspended Andre Gray and Scott Arfield respectively. Meanwhile, the visitors made one enforced alteration from the team that beat Man Utd 3-1 in their last Premier League game, with Nordin Amrabat replacing the injured Daryl Janmaat at right-back. Burnley's Jeff Hendrick (C) celebrates with team-mates after scoring against Watford And in what was the first-ever top-flight meeting between the two, it was the Clarets who made the better start, with George Boyd being denied by a brilliant fingertip save from Watford goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes nine minutes in. The home side, who have found goals hard to come by so far this season, continued to dominate the first half, albeit without ever really working Gomes in the Hornets goal. Iceland international Gudmundsson went close with one effort midway through the first period that flew inches past Gomes' near post, but just as Watford started to gain a foothold in the contest, Burnley opened the scoring after 38 minutes. The outstanding Defour swung a right-wing corner deep towards the far post where Hendrick, the club's record signing, rose to place a header through a posse of players in the six-yard box and into the back of the net. Jeff Hendrick heads home Burnley's opener against Watford The Hornets, who had beaten both Man Utd and West Ham in their previous two league outings, came out charged up after the break and very nearly equalised within four minutes of the restart. However, England international Tom Heaton stood tall at his near post to beat away Troy Deeney's close-range effort and 60 seconds later, after a Burnley counterattack had ended in a left-wing corner, the home team had doubled their lead. Defour, who was signed from Anderlecht in the close season, saw his initial cross cleared straight back to him, but second time round the midfielder delivered a devilish delivery from which Keane somehow managed to plant a back header past a helpless Gomes. Watford huffed and puffed as they went in search of a goal to bring them back into the contest. However, the closest they came was when substitute Isaac Success dribbled his way to the left-hand byline, only for his goalbound effort from the tightest of angles to be deflected behind for a corner by the legs of Heaton.

West Ham 0-3 Southampton West Ham fell to a fourth consecutive Premier League defeat on Sunday afternoon as they were beaten 3-0 by Southampton. Slaven Bilic had made just two changes from the 4-2 defeat to West Brom last weekend, but went behind in the 40th minute after the in-form Charlie Austin scored his fifth goal in four games in all competitions for the Saints. Charlie Austin scored as Southampton beat West Ham 3-0 on Sunday The visitors then doubled their lead just after the hour mark as Dusan Tadic nicked past goalkeeper Adrian and tapped into an open net before James Ward-Prowse rounded off the scoring in the second minute of injury time. West Ham remain in the relegation places, sitting in 18th on three points, while Southampton move up to ninth with eight points after their victory. Dusan Tadic rounded goalkeeper Adrian to make it 2-0 to Southampton The first half was a mostly quiet affair with neither side having many clear-cut chances, although West Ham did have a penalty appeal turned down in the 17th minute when Simone Zaza went down under pressure from Cedric Soares but referee Jon Moss waved away the calls. West Ham captain Mark Noble says to concede 11 goals in three games is laughable West Ham captain Mark Noble says to concede 11 goals in three games is laughable Twenty minutes later, the first chance of the half emerged as Dimitri Payet knocked in a corner that was headed on by Zaza at the near post and looked destined for Michail Antonio, but he couldn't get to the ball in time and it flashed across the face of the goal. Southampton manager Claude Puel says he is extremely happy with his side's first away win of the season Southampton manager Claude Puel says he is extremely happy with his side's first away win of the season But Southampton broke the deadlock with five minutes of the half to play, as Steven Davis found Tadic on the left flank who in turn played in an onrushing Bertrand. The defender then crossed for Austin, who made no mistake in sliding home to score in his fourth consecutive game in all competitions. West Ham manager Slaven Bilic says his side did not do enough and deserved to lose West Ham manager Slaven Bilic says his side did not do enough and deserved to lose Southampton could have had a second just before half-time, with Nathan Redmond forcing a save from the West Ham goalkeeper before Cedric smashed the side netting with a close-range effort. Tadic celebrates his second goal for the Saints The visitors, buoyed by their late first-half goal, started well in the second half with Adrian again called into action, saving from a looping Jose Fonte header before Tadic tried his luck - but the Serb could only find the feet of the Hammers stopper. West Ham had a second penalty appeal waved away by referee Moss and Zaza was the felled man once again, although Oriol Romeu just pulled out of the tackle as the striker went down leading to a simulation booking for the Italian. Manuel Lanzini is chased by Cedric Soares during the game at the London Stadium Southampton doubled their lead in the 62nd minute, as Redmond won the ball from Cheikhou Kouyate and found Austin, who took one touch to chip the ball into the path of Tadic. The midfielder then rounded the onrushing Adrian and stroked home into an open net. But the Hammers had their chances to get back into the game, with the subdued Payet poking an effort off target after a great break from Antonio, before Virgil van Dijk cleared an effort from Zaza off the line. Austin, man of the match, and Tadic speak to Geoff Shreeves after Southampton's win Austin, man of the match, and Tadic speak to Geoff Shreeves after Southampton's win Adrian continued to face pressure from the Saints though, keeping out stinging efforts from Ward-Prowse and Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg but he couldn't stop a second effort from the former. Redmond picked out a gut-busting run from Davis into the box, who knocked the ball into the path of Ward-Prowse and he obliged by slotting it into the back of the net. It rounded off another bad day at the office for West Ham, who have now lost five of their opening six Premier League games for the first time in their history.

Paul Pogba was named man-of-the-match as Manchester United beat Leicester 4-1 at Old Trafford Paul Pogba was named man-of-the-match as Manchester United beat Leicester 4-1 at Old Trafford Chris Smalling's header from a corner put them ahead halfway through the first period, before Rooney's replacement Juan Mata finished off a superb team-move for 2-0.

Wayne Rooney was dropped for the clash at Old Trafford Substitute Demarai Gray scored a stunning consolation for the champions from 25 yards on the hour mark, but it wasn't enough to start a comeback as Leicester suffered their third defeat in six games this season. Rooney was dropped for Mata in one of four changes by Jose Mourinho, but both sides got off to a conservative start in the lunchtime kick-off. Manchester United midfielder Pogba and Jesse Lingard celebrate With the first clear chance of the game after 22 minutes, United were ahead. Daley Blind's deep corner found the head of Smalling eight yards out, and he made no mistake despite Ron-Robert Zieler getting a hand on his effort. Zlatan Ibrahimovic should have made it two moments later, but his volley on the turn went over the bar following Pogba's sublime lob over the Leicester defence. Chris Smalling opens the scoring for Manchester United But it was 2-0 on 37 minutes, Mata sweeping the ball into the corner of the net after a fine team move involving Pogba and Jesse Lingard, who flicked the ball into the Spaniard's path 18 yards out.

Man Utd boss Jose Mourinho claimed he was pleased with the result and performance Man Utd boss Jose Mourinho claimed he was pleased with the result and performance And it was three goals in six minutes moments later, Pogba glancing a header into the right corner from Blind's corner for his first in a United shirt. Claudio Ranieri brought off Jamie Vardy and Riyad Mahrez at half-time as they look forward to their Champions League home clash against Porto on Tuesday, and it was Gray, one of the replacements, who gave Leicester fans something to cheer about. Jose Mourinho and Claudio Ranieri look on at Old Trafford Cutting inside from the left on 60 minutes, the winger hit an unstoppable effort past David de Gea into the top corner from 25 yards. Ibrahimovic then saw his low shot from 18 yards tipped wide by Zieler, while at the other end Andy King's weak effort from a good position was gathered by De Gea. Gray nearly scored an identical second from outside the area, tipped wide by De Gea, before Rooney was introduced with just seven minutes remaining by Mourinho. It stayed 4-1, meaning United emphatically avoided a third straight Premier League defeat, while Leicester have now lost as many league games as they did in the entire 2015/16 season.

"report": "Watch highlights of Bournemouth 1-0 Everton Watch highlights of Bournemouth 1-0 Everton Everton lost their unbeaten start to the season as Junior Stanislas netted a thumping winner for Bournemouth in a 1-0 victory on Saturday at the Vitality Stadium. Stanislas, who netted a late equaliser in this corresponding fixture last season, struck midway through a first-half, which saw the hosts hit the woodwork twice. Everton lacked cutting edge in the final third, however, Enner Valencia did squander a good chance late on. The win snaps a run of two straight defeats for The Cherries, who had also lost nine of their last 13 Premier League games coming into this. Everton welcomed back four-goal Romelu Lukaku into the fray after he missed the midweek defeat against Norwich with a toe injury but Leighton Baines missed out due to a hamstring problem. Gareth Barry was declared fit to play despite struggling with a groin problem and he looked a yard off the pace as Harry Arter and Jack Wilshere dominated the midfield battle early on. Jack Wilshere (R) vies for possession with Gareth Barry Callum Wilson, who ran the two Everton centre-backs ragged in the early stages set the tone for the hosts and flicked a header wide with just 90 seconds on the clock. Everton settled but only looked threating from set-pieces. Lukaku forced a fantastic one-handed save from Arthur Boruc on 10 minutes after he wriggled free about seven yards from goal. Bournemouth responded and put together a blistering 10 minutes spell of all-action football, where they hit the woodwork twice and then took the lead. Everton's Romelu Lukaku (left) and Bournemouth's Steve Cook battle for the ball Wilson broke away again down the right and his cross was stoked towards goal by Wilshere but Seamus Coleman's deflection took the ball onto the crossbar. The upright was rattling again minutes later when Arter dribbled forward and curled a left-footed effort against the outside of the far post. The hosts deserved the lead and they got it on 22 minutes. Everton were slow to react as Bournemouth switched the play. Arter found Stanislas about 22 yards and he fired an unstoppable effort right into the top corner. Junior Stanislas celebrates scoring his side's first goal with his team-mates Ross Barkley was a subdued figure throughout and should've levelled the game on 54 minutes but he powered a header wide from 12 yards after a wicked cross from Coleman. Eddie Howe's men had kept just one clean sheet in last 17 games in all competitions and you could see how much their manager wanted to improve that poor run as he headed and kicked very ball on the touchline. His team didn't give him many heart-fluttering moments, although Valencia really should've done better on 89 minutes when he turned a Yannick Bolasie cross wide from close range.

the Premier League with a 5-1 victory over Hull at Anfield. Adam Lallana's third top-flight goal of the season kicked things off for Jurgen Klopp's side, who dominated from first minute to last. For the second week running, Hull were reduced to 10 men when Ahmed Elmohamady was shown a straight red card by referee Andre Marriner for handball. That allowed Milner to make it two from the spot, before Sadio Mane secured a three-goal lead for the hosts at the interval.

Middlesbrough to remain unbeaten and go second in the table. The Londoners were without last season's Golden Boot winner Harry Kane but their attacking threat was undiminished in the first half. The visitors were less inspired after the break and an improved Boro side pulled one back through Ben Gibson, but they could not find an equaliser and Spurs are off to their best ever start to a Premier League season. Vincent Janssen deputised for Kane and made a good impression, linking well with Son, Christian Eriksen and Dele Alli. Heung-Min Son of Tottenham Hotspur celebrates scoring his first goal Meanwhile, Premier League new boys Boro have now lost three in a row, but showed plenty of fight in the second-half, buoyed by the introduction of Adama Traore.

And Spurs initially continued to hold sway after the break, but their build-up play was a little more laboured and an end product was also lacking.

Downing produced another excellent cross 10 minutes later, but Rhodes could only direct his header straight at Hugo Lloris, and the Boro comeback bid ran out of steam somewhat after that, sub Adam Forshaw volleying a tricky late chance wide of the target.

Brom at the Bet365 Stadium Highlights of Stoke's 1-1 draw with West Brom at the Bet365 Stadium Salomon Rondon's stoppage-time equaliser secured West Brom a 1-1 draw at Stoke to leave Mark Hughes’ side winless in the Premier League. Joe Allen had looked to have won it for the Potters when he bundled the ball home via a deflection off Claudio Yacob but Stoke's weakness from set-pieces cost them. Rondon's header from Darren Fletcher's left-wing corner was too hot for Lee Grant to handle and earned the Baggies a scarcely-deserved point on the occasion of Tony Pulis' 1000th game as a manager. It will be a bitter blow for Pulis' former club but the point does at least lift them off the bottom of the Premier League table following Sunderland's collapse at home to Crystal Palace. Post-match reaction from Mark Hughes after Stoke's 1-1 draw with West Brom. Post-match reaction from Mark Hughes after Stoke's 1-1 draw with West Brom. Stoke had been the better side for much of the game with Allen busy in midfield and Xherdan Shaqiri looking particularly bright on his first Premier League appearance since the opening weekend. The home side certainly had the better openings of an otherwise evenly-balanced first half in which both teams competed well without really exhibiting much in the way of quality. Erik Pieters twice wanted a penalty for challenges on him but was denied Erik Pieters wanted a penalty for a perceived foul in the box by Matt Phillips after Marko Arnautovic had slipped him into space down the left channel but referee Martin Atkinson waved the claims away. Shaqiri then almost putting Wilfried Bony through with a clever reverse pass, but the best chance before the break fell to Glen Johnson. The full-back found himself in space inside the penalty box after Bony's header deflected into his path and he managed to lift the ball over goalkeeper Ben Foster only to see Craig Dawson clear brilliantly from off the line. That was as close as Stoke came before the interval but they started the second half much the brighter side and Pieters had another shout for a penalty as he got in behind Phillips yet again. Stoke dominated much of the game but were pegged back late on Peter Crouch replaced Bony midway through the half as the home side pushed for a breakthrough and it came from a predictable route soon after. Shaqiri, who'd troubled Allan Nyom all afternoon, cut inside and whipped in a cross that Jonny Evans could only head into the path of Allen who netted under pressure from Yacob. The relief around the stadium was palpable and with Albion creating so little, a long awaited three points appeared to be heading Stoke's way.

But with both Allen and Shaqiri withdrawn there was still time for the visitors to get their goal as they capitalised on a needlessly conceded corner. Confusion between Grant, on his Premier League debut, and Bruno Martins-Indi resulted in the latter knocking the ball behind and Rondon headed home brilliantly to punish the Potters. Joe Allen looked to have won it for Stoke with his second-half goal Stoke had switched to a zonal defence following a series of errors defending set-pieces but this goal is a reminder that their problems at the back continue. The point lifts both teams one place up the Premier League table but that's the very least that Hughes needed. The pressure on the Stoke boss remains after this result.

Jermain Defoe exploited Joe Ledley's wild pass in defence to put the home side ahead before the break and added a second after it to put the Wearsiders on course for victory. Palace hit back 66 seconds later through Ledley, however, before James McArthur levelled and Christian Benteke headed in the winner deep in stoppage time. Six games into the season, Moyes' only successes as Sunderland boss remain in the EFL Cup - and his side now moves to the bottom of the table. It was a tentative start from both sides, with neither displaying much pace to begin with and both guilty of sloppy decision making as they tried to take a grip of the game. Adnan Januzaj of Sunderland takes the ball past Crystal Palace winger Andros Townsend Indeed, it took the best part of half an hour for any sort of clear-cut chance to come as both sides struggled to set a tempo which would give them an edge. Watch the free-kick that led to Palace's winner Watch the free-kick that led to Palace's winner Patrick van Aanholt and Adnan Januzaj were both threats going forward for Sunderland but final balls often let the side down. Likewise, Yohan Cabaye should have done better when Jason Puncheon threaded him in than send a tame ball back across goal where they was nobody looking to pounce. Jermain Defoe scores Sunderland's opener against Palace When that first opportunity came, it was Defoe who had it with an imaginative flick from van Aanholt's cross and it dropped just wide of the target. The next time the former England forward was involved, he put Sunderland ahead - but the goal was one Mandanda and Ledley won't look back on fondly. The goalkeeper's threaded pass to the Wales midfielder was fast and a little ambitious given the amount of players from both sides in close proximity as he played it 30 yards out from goal. Januzaj applied pressure on Ledley and he was rushed into a pass back but only played in the lurking Defoe. Jermain Defoe celebrates his first goal with team-mates at the Stadium of Light He then got between James Tomkins and James McArthur to poke past Mandanda. Ledley will be blamed by some for what happened but the keeper was just as culpable. Unbeaten in their last 22 league games in which they have led at half-time, Sunderland will have come out for the restart optimistic of preserving their lead.

Palace broke with purpose after a mistake from Januzaj and a three-man passing move ended with Puncheon drawing a good stop from Jordan Pickford. James McArthur of Crystal Palace celebrates scoring his side's second goal Their momentum was nipped when Defoe got his second on the hour from substitute Duncan Watmore's cutback after his initial shot had been saved seconds earlier by Mandanda. But Palace's response to that was emphatic, Ledley reducing the deficit again a minute and six seconds later with a strike which was deflected away from Jordan Pickford by van Aanholt. Sunderland missed out on a third after a move which began with a sublime pass down the line from Lee Cattermole and ended with Defoe blazing his hat-trick chance over the bar. And they paid for that when substitute Zeki Fryers swung in for McArthur to head a leveller from close range with 15 minutes left. Joe Ledley celebrates scoring Palace's first goal a minute after Defoe had put Sunderland 2-0 ahead There was more drama to come and for many Sunderland supporters, they could probably feel it coming given the clear deflation at surrendering a lead and being pegged back to 2-2. Javier Manquillo gave away a clumsy free-kick wide on the left four minutes into time added on and when it came in, Benteke headed over the line to complete a remarkable comeback.

a 3-1 win over Swansea at the Liberty Stadium on Saturday. Aguero, on his return from a three-match suspension, opened the scoring with a fine finish before Fernando Llorente swiftly equalised with his first goal for Swansea. Aguero added his second of the game, and 11th of the season, from the penalty spot after Mike van der Hoorn was penalised for an arm across the face of Kevin De Bruyne, and Raheem Sterling completed the scoring. There was a late injury worry for Pep Guardiola as De Bruyne limped off appearing to hold his hamstring, but the victory makes it six wins from six league games, and 10 in a row in all competitions under the new head coach. Sergio Aguero celebrates scoring Manchester City's second from the penalty spot Guardiola's side were ahead after nine minutes as Aguero fired through the legs of Lukasz Fabianski after beating Jordi Amat with a smart first touch.

The hosts raced into a 2-0 lead inside the opening 15 minutes as Alexis Sanchez capitalised on an error from Gary Cahill and then Theo Walcott finished from Hector Bellerin's low cross. Arsenal had not beaten Chelsea in the Premier League since 2011, but Mesut Ozil volleyed in a third before the break to cap off a dominant first-half display. Substitute Michy Batshuayi went closest to pulling a goal back late on with Chelsea's only shot on target. Otherwise the visitors rarely threatened as Arsenal won their fourth straight league game in the week that Arsene Wenger celebrated 20 years in charge. Mesut Ozil (C) celebrates scoring Arsenal's third For Chelsea, it is a second defeat in a row and there are signs that Antonio Conte has work to do, especially in defence, where the visitors looked far from convincing. Having brought in ex-Gunner Cesc Fabregas for his first league start of the season, Chelsea quickly fell 2-0 behind. With just 11 minutes gone, Cahill was caught in possession by Sanchez, who raced clear and cooly dinked over Thibaut Courtois. Theo Walcott finished from Hector Bellerin's cross for the second It was soon 2-0 after some crisp passing from the hosts which ended with Bellerin crossing for Walcott to tap in from close range. Chelsea continued to look unconvincing in defence, but they did go close after 21 minutes as Willian shot across goal. That was a rare opening for the visitors, who fell further behind after 40 minutes. Gary Cahill looks to the sky after Arsenal score N'Golo Kante was turned by Ozil, who raced away from inside his own half and played it forward to Sanchez. He returned the favour for Ozil to volley in the third at the back post. Eden Hazard shot into the side-netting late in the half for Chelsea, who made a change in the 55th minute, bringing on Marcos Alonso for Fabregas. They also switched to three at the back, which sometimes left them exposed on the counter, but did give them more of an attacking threat.

Etienne Capoue's fourth goal of the season put the hosts in front at Vicarage Road, before Marcus Rashford equalised from close range after the break. An inspired change by Walter Mazzarri saw substitute Juan Camilo Zuniga sweep Watford back ahead with his first touch seven minutes from time, and Troy Deeney added a late penalty after Zuniga was fouled by Marouane Fellaini. United were left frustrated at Vicarage Road Defeat for United - who lost Anthony Martial shortly before half-time after an earlier clash of heads with Daryl Janmaat - caps a miserable eight days for Jose Mourinho's side after they were beaten in the Manchester derby last Saturday and then in the Europa League by Feyenoord on Thursday. It is the first time Mourinho has lost three games in a row as a manager since August 2006, when he was in his first spell at Chelsea. The hosts - who have beaten United for the first time in 30 years - started quickly and Odion Ighalo squandered a golden opportunity to open the scoring after a mix-up between David de Gea and Chris Smalling presented the Watford striker with an open goal, but he somehow fired wide. David de Gea and Chris Smalling collided, presenting Odion Ighalo with a golden opportunity De Gea then saved well from Deeney before United carved out their first opportunity, only for Zlatan Ibrahimovic to shoot wide from six yards. Paul Pogba, playing alongside Wayne Rooney and Fellaini in a midfield three, struck the crossbar with a superb long-range effort but just as the visitors were growing into the game, Watford went in front. Anthony Martial walks off the pitch with a member of the Manchester United medical team after a clash of heads Martial was robbed of possession on the edge of his own box and Janmaat crossed for Capoue, who struck first-time past De Gea. Jose Mourinho says his Manchester United side were in full control at 1-1 and was disappointed as his side lost late on Jose Mourinho says his Manchester United side were in full control at 1-1 and was disappointed as his side lost late on It was Martial's last involvement in the match too. He was clearly shaken up having been involved in a nasty clash of heads with Janmaat midway through the first half, and Mourinho introduced Ashley Young in his place just before half-time. Marcus Rashford (C) scores the equaliser for Manchester United United got back on level terms with their first shot on target as Rashford, who kept his place from the Feyenoord defeat, tapped home after Ibrahimovic's cross came back off the unfortunate Valon Behrami. The expected late United surge never materialised, and the hosts re-took the lead with seven minutes remaining through Zuniga. Etienne Capoue celebrates scoring his side's first goal The Hornets substitute had been on the pitch 53 seconds when Roberto Pereyra picked him out, and he fired past De Gea to make an immediate contribution. Frustrations for United threatened to boil over as Rooney, Memphis Depay and Fellaini were all booked in the closing stages, and Watford added further gloss to the scoreline when the latter tripped Zuniga in the penalty area. Watford boss Walter Mazzari says he's happy to fulfil the Hornet fans' wishes as they beat Manchester United for the first time in 30 years Watford boss Walter Mazzari says he's happy to fulfil the Hornet fans' wishes as they beat Manchester United for the first time in 30 years Referee Michael Oliver pointed to the spot and Deeney made no mistake, blasting down the middle to wrap up Watford's second league win of the season.

Palace's 4-1 win over Stoke Watch highlights of Crystal Palace's 4-1 win over Stoke Crystal Palace won back-to-back Premier League games for the first time this year as they beat struggling Stoke 4-1 at Selhurst Park on Sunday. Debutant James Tomkins gave Palace the lead after nine minutes, with his centre-back partner Scott Dann heading in a second shortly afterwards. James McArthur's deflected effort in the 71st minute made it 3-0 and Andros Townsend added a fine fourth after running from halfway. Stoke, beaten 4-0 at home by Tottenham last week, did grab a late consolation through Marko Arnautovic, but they remain rock bottom of the Premier League, with 14 goals conceded in five games. James McArthur celebrates scoring with his Crystal Palace team-mates Palace, by contrast, seem to be on an upward curve, having recovered from successive defeats to start the season. Tomkins made his first start for the Eagles after joining from West Ham in the summer, replacing Damien Delaney in defence. Stoke also made a switch at the back as Glen Johnson made his first appearance since February. It was a defensive quickfire double that put Palace in control of the game inside the opening 15 minutes. Andros Townsend added a fine fourth for Palace First, Tomkins turned in a free-kick at the back post after Jon Walters failed to clear, before Dann powered home a header from a corner just two minutes later. Stoke rarely looked like reducing the deficit before the break, with their best moment coming when Bony nicked the ball off Dann and then curled a shot a few yards wide. Scott Dann celebrates scoring the second goal Bony otherwise was ineffective as Stoke had just one effort on goal and one touch in the Palace box in the first half. The hosts hardly created chances aplenty at the other end but they did go close after the break as Dann had a header cleared off the line and Shay Given saved a close-range effort from Wilfried Zaha. Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew was delighted with the performance in their 4-1 win Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew was delighted with the performance in their 4-1 win Palace did get a third in the 72nd minute as McArthur's shot from inside the box took a heavy deflection off Geoff Cameron and sailed past Given. Townsend then added another in quick succession, racing clear in the Stoke half before cutting inside and curling a fine shot into the bottom corner.

Nathan Redmond wasted two great opportunities to give the Saints the lead in the first half, but it was the second-half introduction of Austin that proved the difference. The striker, who had scored a brace against Sparta Prague in the Europa League in midweek, went agonisingly close to opening the scoring when his header crashed back off the crossbar and drifted the wrong side of the post off the back of goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski. But Austin made no mistake with his second great chance in the 64th minute, controlling a deflected Redmond cross on his chest before lashing in what turned out to be a deserved winning goal. The win - Southampton's first of the season - was the least that Claude Puel's side deserved after a completely dominant display against their lacklustre visitors. Charlie Austin scores for Southampton against Swansea They had the pick of the opportunities in a goalless first half, playing some superb football at times, with Dusan Tadic, Redmond and Shane Long linking up to great effect in the final third. An error by Swansea goalkeeper Fabianski, spilling Long's shot from range, went unpunished as Tadic was caught offside as he attempted to turn home the rebound. However, the goalkeeper did make amends as he tipped a Tadic free-kick over the bar shortly afterwards, and a Virgil van Dijk header also forced a save out of the busy Swansea keeper as Southampton continued to push for an opener as the first half progressed.

The Saints stepped it up a gear as the interval approached, and the St Mary's faithful thought they had a penalty when Long went down in the box, only for referee Mike Jones to instead book the striker for diving - a decision that split opinion, despite the striker going down before contact was made. But the opening goal should have come from the boot of Redmond moments before the break, only for the winger to blast over the bar when clean through - a miss that further frustrated Long, who was unmarked and waiting for a square ball in the centre of the box. Redmond produced an even more shocking miss in the 44th minute, cutting back on to his right foot to wrong-foot the last covering defender and leave the goal gaping, only to once again send his shot soaring into the crowd behind the goal. A frustrated Saints came exploding out of the blocks in the second half, with the lively Long sending a shot sliding past Fabianski only for Kyle Naughton to clear it off the line. And Long should have had a goal to his name shortly afterwards when he tucked home Redmond's cross, only for the winger to be wrongly adjudged as having drifted offside. Charlie Austin (R) celebrates his goal with team-mate Cedric Soares Frustration started to build around St Mary's as Austin's header came back off the bar, but the goal finally came just after the hour mark and Swansea barely threatened from there on, with a Fraser Forster save from Gylfi Sigurdsson's shot the only late scare for the home side.

Premier League games as Tottenham Hotspur beat Sunderland 1-0 on Sunday, but was stretchered off late on. The home side claimed all three points thanks to Kane's close-range finish after 59 minutes following a mistake by Sunderland centre-back Papy Djilobodji. As a result, Spurs went above rivals Arsenal in the table after not losing any of their first five league games of the season for the first time in 12 years, while Sunderland - who saw Adnan Januzaj sent off at the death - remain in the relegation zone as they still seek their first top-flight win this campaign. However, Mauricio Pochettino's afternoon turned sour when Kane was carried off three minutes from time with a serious-looking ankle injury, with the Argentine later revealing his striker was set to undergo a scan to determine the extent of the problem. The Tottenham boss made three changes from the side that lost 2-1 to Monaco in the Champions League at Wembley in midweek, with Mousa Dembele making his first Premier League appearance of the season after completing a domestic suspension. Spurs striker Harry Kane celebrates opening the scoring against Sunderland Meanwhile, Moussa Sissoko made his first start for the club since joining from Newcastle in the summer and there was a reshuffle in defence, with Eric Dier dropping back to play in the heart of the back line and Jan Vertonghen filling in at left back for the injured Danny Rose. As for the visitors, David Moyes also made three alterations from the team that lost 3-0 at home to Everton in their last Premier League game, all in midfield, with the Scot recalling captain Lee Cattermole, Didier Ndong and Steven Pienaar. Harry Kane puts Tottenham Hotspur ahead at White Hart Lane However, Sunderland made an unexpected late change, with Jason Denayer coming in for Patrick Van Aanholt moments before kick-off, and the Belgium international was given a tough examination by Son Heung-min on his Premier League debut for the club. The South Korea international was a bundle of energy down the left flank in the opening exchanges, with Sunderland goalkeeper Jordan Pickford being forced into a brilliant reaction save at his near post to keep out Kane's close-range shot after nine minutes. Kyle Walker clears a shot from Steven Pienaar off the line Pickford was an increasingly busy figure as the first period wore on as shots rained down on the visitors' 'keeper, with one particular effort from Son Heung-min six minutes before half-time beating the England U21 international, only to strike the outside of the post. However, despite all Spurs' pressure, it was Sunderland who created the best chance of the first half after good play by Januzaj in the box saw the Belgian escape to the right-hand byline and pull the ball back for Steven Pienaar, whose close-range effort was cleared off the line by Kyle Walker. Hugo Lloris celebrates after Harry Kane gives Tottenham the lead at White Hart Lane The pattern of the second half was much the same as the first, with Spurs pressing for the opening goal, which finally came just before the hour-mark, although Sunderland will be disappointed with their part in it. Mauricio Pochettino hailed his Tottenham team after they picked up all three points against a struggling Sunderland side. Mauricio Pochettino hailed his Tottenham team after they picked up all three points against a struggling Sunderland side. Kyle Walker swung in a cross from the right which Dele Alli headed back across goal, only for Djilobodji to make a hash of his clearance in the six-yard box and present Kane with a simple tap-in at the far post. Harry Kane is stretched off late on at White Hart Lane The home side - who had a Premier League record so far this season of 31 shots on goal - had several chances to increase their lead in the final quarter of the game, with Pickford furthering his already growing reputation by denying Alli and substitute Erik Lamela with excellent stops, while Dier also flashed a shot inches past the far post. Sunderland manager David Moyes admits it was a tough match against Tottenham but was pleased they kept themselves in the game. Sunderland manager David Moyes admits it was a tough match against Tottenham but was pleased they kept themselves in the game. However, Pochettino may now have to make do without the likes of Kane, Dier, who suffered a hamstring injury, and Walker, who also appeared to be nursing a hamstring problem in the closing stages, over the course of the next few weeks. Tottenham Hotspur coach Mauricio Pochettino gestures from the touchline As for the Black Cats, Moyes saw on-loan Manchester United wide man Januzaj dismissed in the 90th minute having picked up two bookings in the final nine minutes of the game, the first a needless caution for dissent.

10-man Hull 4-1 on Saturday. Arsene Wenger's side took the lead after 17 minutes at the KCOM Stadium when Alex Iwobi's shot deflected in off Sanchez. Jake Livermore was shown a straight red card late in the half for blocking a goal-bound effort with his arm, but Eldin Jakupovic saved Sanchez's spot-kick. Theo Walcott doubled Arsenal's advantage shortly after the break and it looked comfortable for the visitors until Robert Snodgrass converted a penalty of his own with 11 minutes remaining. But Hull's hopes of a comeback were dashed as Sanchez made it 3-1 and Granit Xhaka rounded off the scoring with a superb long-range strike. The goal is Xhaka's first for the Gunners, who have now won three in a row in the Premier League. Sam Clucas of Hull holds off Theo Walcott While Hull named an unchanged starting XI for the fifth league game in a row, Petr Cech and Walcott returned for Arsenal, with Xhaka among the substitutes. Sanchez again started up front for the visitors with Olivier Giroud out with a toe injury and it was the Chilean who had the first chance, scooping a shot over the bar from the penalty spot in the 13th minute. The Gunners continued to apply pressure and got the breakthrough when Jakupovic palmed out a cross from Walcott and Iwobi's follow-up shot deflected in off Sanchez.

Hull struggled to create chances at the other end and they were fortunate not to fall further behind as Jakupovic saved well from Iwobi and Mesut Ozil fired the rebound over the bar from 10 yards out. Arsenal spurned another chance later in the half, this time from the penalty spot. Livermore was shown a straight red for blocking a goal-bound shot with his arm but Sanchez saw his spot-kick saved, having taken over penalty duties from Santi Cazorla.

highlights from Man City's 4-0 win over Bournemouth A rampant Manchester City maintained their 100 per cent start to the season by cruising past Bournemouth 4-0 at the Etihad on Saturday. The home side led 2-0 at half-time after strikes from the outstanding Kevin De Bruyne and Kelechi Iheanacho, who was once again deputising for the suspended Sergio Aguero. City wrapped up the points by adding further goals after the break from Raheem Sterling and Ilkay Gundogan, who was making his Premier League debut, with their only disappointment being the late red card for Nolito. However, City - who also recorded their first clean sheet of the campaign - remain top of the table after an eighth successive win in all competitions, an unprecedented feat for the club at the start of a season, while Bournemouth are 16th. City boss Pep Guardiola handed John Stones a rest, with the England international being joined on the substitutes' bench by club captain Vincent Kompany after his recovery from a long-term groin problem. Manchester City's Belgian midfielder Kevin De Bruyne celebrates scoring the opening goal against Bournemouth Elsewhere, the in-form Aguero was serving the second game of his three-match ban, while as expected David Silva missed out through injury. Gundogan, though, was passed fit to take his place in central midfield, where the German came face to face with Jack Wilshere, making his first start since joining Bournemouth on loan from Arsenal in place of Callum Wilson. Other than that, the visitors kept the same team that beat West Bromwich Albion 1-0 at home last weekend, when Wilson scored the winner, although right from the kick-off it became clear a far more exacting afternoon was in store for them as De Bruyne tested Artur Boruc with a stinging drive. It was not long, though, before City did open the scoring on the quarter-hour mark and Wilshere will not be happy with his part in the goal after the midfielder first lost possession of the ball to Fernandinho, before then bringing down Nolito on the edge of the box. Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola shows his delight after his side's second goal against Bournemouth De Bruyne made Wilshere pay by drilling the resulting free kick low through Bournemouth's wall, who did not help themselves by jumping up to block what they thought would be an aerial shot from the Belgian, and leaving Boruc helpless as a result. Wilshere very nearly cost his team another goal minutes later after again gifting up possession on the halfway line, only for Boruc to come to his rescue by keeping out Nolito's close-range strike after another blistering City counterattack. City soon doubled their lead, however, as Bournemouth were caught with too many players upfield following a free kick and within a blink of an eye Nolito's wonderful pass found De Bruyne, who released Sterling, and the England forward then unselfishly put a goal on a plate for Iheanacho. Kevin De Bruyne nets the opening goal at the Etihad And that strike after 25 minutes was Iheanacho's 10th in the Premier League from a total of just 14 shots on target from Aguero's increasingly impressive understudy. Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe reacted to a chastening first period by introducing Wilson in place for club-record signing Jordan Ibe at the interval, but the change made little difference as City put the game to bed by scoring twice more with a quarter of the contest still to play. Sterling, looking more and more the player who nearly helped fire Liverpool to the title in 2013-14 season before his big-money move to the Etihad, was the goalscorer three minutes into the second period, although again it was another team effort.

Man-of-the-match De Bruyne was given the freedom of Manchester before picking out Iheanacho's run and the Nigerian's inch-perfect pass across the six-yard box was converted by Sterling in a repeat of City's second goal. However, City left the best for last with an absolute picture book of a goal after 66 minutes involving the likes of De Bruyne, Gael Clichy and Nolito, before inevitably the former sent Gundogan through on goal and the midfielder made no mistake with a cool side-footed finish past a wrong-footed Boruc.

The visitors, who removed the ineffective Wilshere midway through the second half, were unfortunate not to score a consolation 13 minutes from time when Wilson hit the bar, but by that point the game was over as a contest. Manchester City players celebrate Kevin De Bruyne's opening goal against Bournemouth The only blot on City's copybook was Nolito's 86th-minute sending-off for a needless headbutt on Bournemouth right-back Adam Smith, with the Spain international now missing their next three games, including a trip to Tottenham Hotspur. But that mattered little as Guardiola's side become only the second different team in top-flight history to win their opening five league games in consecutive seasons after Chelsea, who also managed the feat in 2009/10 and the following campaign.

Brom held off a spirited West Ham fightback to win 4-2 at the Hawthorns on Saturday. The hosts raced to a 3-0 lead at the break after goals from Nacer Chadli, Salomon Rondon and James McClean. Chadli's second put West Brom in cruise control, but West Ham hit back thanks to a Michail Antonio header and Manuel Lanzini penalty. However, Tony Pulis' side saw out an action-packed game to claim a valuable three points and pick up their first league win since the opening day of the season. It may yet prove to be a valuable win for Pulis personally, after he admitted on Friday that the new West Brom owners will have the final say on his future. Nacer Chadli celebrates scoring his sides first goal with Salomon Rondón of West Brom The hosts got off to the perfect start thanks to two lapses in concentration from West Ham's Arthur Masuaku. Moments after Masuaku conceded a free-kick for handball, the Frenchman gave away a penalty for handling in the area, with the ball seemingly heading to safety.

3-1 victory over Middlesbrough at Goodison Park Sign-in to watch highlights of Everton's 3-1 victory over Middlesbrough at Goodison Park Everton extended their unbeaten start to life under Ronald Koeman to five games as they came from behind to beat Middlesbrough 3-1 at Goodison Park. In controversial circumstances, Maarten Stekelenburg's 21st-minute own goal had threatened to derail the hosts' bright start to life under the Dutchman, but, on his 600th Premier League appearance, Gareth Barry hauled Everton level just three minutes later. From that point, Koeman's side took firm control of the contest as Seamus Coleman's fine individual effort put them ahead before Romelu Lukaku grabbed his fourth goal in two games with their third before half-time. And the Merseysiders saw out the victory with ease as they moved up to second in the Premier League table, securing their best start to the league campaign since 1978. Meanwhile, a second successive defeat for Middlesbrough, who failed to register a single shot on target in the game, leaves them in 11th position. Unsurprisingly, Koeman named the same side that romped to victory at Sunderland on Monday, keeping faith with Ross Barkley after he was hooked at half-time at the Stadium of Light, while Lukaku, fresh from ending his 13-game goal drought, led the attack. Gareth Barry capped his 600th Premier League appearance with the equaliser at Goodison Park Aitor Karanka, meanwhile, made three changes for the trip to Merseyside as Marten de Roon, Emilio Nsue and Gaston Ramirez were drafted in from the start. And it was the visitors who started brightly, although Stewart Downing should have done better to head Gaston Ramirez's free-kick goalwards on seven minutes. After Barkley had stoked up the crowd with a rasping drive on 19 minutes, the Goodison Park faithful were stunned as Boro took the lead two minutes later. Alvaro Negredo forced Marten Stekelenburg into a costly error as Middlesbrough took the lead Alvaro Negredo collided with Stekelenburg as the Everton stopper rose to reach a cross tamely, forcing the Dutchman to drop the ball into the unguarded net. Appeals from those in blue fell on deaf ears as referee Lee Mason allowed the goal to stand. But an aggrieved Everton side rallied and found themselves level with three minutes as Victor Valdes' failure to clear a corner saw the ball drop perfectly for Barry six yards out, and the midfielder had the simple task of stroking the ball home on his landmark day. Middlesbrough's Spanish striker Alvaro Negredo (L) holds off Everton's Costa Rican midfielder Bryan Oviedo A frenetic 10-minute period was followed by a lull as both sides drew breath, but Coleman sparked the game back into life on 42 minutes.

Ronald Koeman has called on Ross Barkley to improve his performances after the midfielder was substituted Ronald Koeman has called on Ross Barkley to improve his performances after the midfielder was substituted Two quickly became three as Lukaku got the faintest of touches on Yannick Bolasie's teasing cross on the stroke of half-time as Everton waltzed into the interval in the driving seat. Everton started the second period in the same vein, dominating possession against a Boro side who looked lost for ideas. Romelu Lukaku wheels away in celebrations after scoring Everton's third But they failed to score a fourth and, once Lukaku had left the field to injury on 64 minutes, their intensity dropped, leading the game to peter out. Boro managed to mount a late rally but, with the damage was already done before the break, there was no danger Everton would surrender their fourth victory of the season on another encouraging outing for Koeman.

Jurgen Klopp's side showed tremendous energy in the first half and raced into a two goal lead thanks to Dejan Lovren's neat finish and Henderson's stunning effort. Chelsea, who were booed off at half-time, failed to lay a glove on the rampant Reds until Diego Costa netted his fifth goal of the season with 29 minutes remaining, but Liverpool saw the game out comfortably. The result moves Liverpool on to 10 points - level with Chelsea - as Antonio Conte suffered his first defeat as Blues head coach. The home fans were treated to a second Chelsea debut for David Luiz, who was the only change to the team that drew 2-2 with Swansea after John Terry suffered ankle ligament damage. David Luiz reacts as Liverpool players celebrate Dejan Lovren's goal Roberto Firmino missed out for Liverpool with a slight groin issue as Daniel Sturridge led the line. It was the England striker that tested Thibaut Courtois early on with a 20-yard strike that the goalkeeper just about juggled to safety. Liverpool were buzzing all over their opponents and took the lead on 17 minutes. Branislav Ivanovic gave a needless foul away on the left flank, from which Liverpool worked the ball to Philippe Coutinho. The Chelsea defence went to sleep and Lovren was left unmarked at the back post to skilfully prod home on the half-volley. Lovren celebrates scoring the first goal of the game It was one way traffic as Chelsea struggled to get Costa into the game - the Spain international only had two touches inside the box in the first half. Liverpool looked full of energy and got their manager off the bench on 36 minutes with a goal of the highest quality. Henderson killed the ball into his stride following a Gary Cahill clearance and curled a wondrous effort from 30 yards right into the top corner. Even some of the Chelsea fans could be seen clapping such was the brilliance of the strike. Chelsea have never won in the Premier League era when two goals down at half-time, but gave their fans hope by pulling a goal back on 61 minutes. Thibaut Courtois fails to save the long-range shot from Jordan Henderson Costa, who grew into the game, was on hand to poke home Nemanja Matic's chipped cross from the by-line. The goal should have given the hosts a lease of life, but it was Liverpool that regained control by slowing the game down and keeping possession shrewdly. Diego Costa scores for Chelsea in the second half at Stamford Bridge Coutinho had an effort blocked away by Cahill on 78 minutes before Courtois had to be alert claw away a Divock Origi header from close range. Conte threw on Cesc Fabregas, Pedro and Victor Moses with seven minutes left, but Chelsea carried little threat with Nathaniel Clyne at the top of his game to keep Eden Hazard quiet. Liverpool have now beat both Arsenal and Chelsea on the road and took a point off Tottenham at White Hart Lane. Klopp's men are moving in the right direction.

"Highlights from Everton's 3-0 win at Sunderland in the Premier League Highlights from Everton's 3-0 win at Sunderland in the Premier League Romelu Lukaku ended his goal drought with an 11-minute hat-trick to send Everton third in the Premier League with a 3-0 win at Sunderland. The Belgian striker had last scored for his club in March and looked to be floundering once again when he had a header saved in an even first half. He struck three times in 11 minutes after the break, however, as the magnificent Idrissa Gueye then Yannick Bolasie set him up before Kevin Mirallas released him for his clincher. Everton could have gone second in the table with a fourth goal but are tucked in just behind Chelsea on goal difference. Romelu Lukaku's hat-trick came in 11 second-half minutes Sunderland remain second bottom, with David Moyes losing for the third time in as many games against the Merseysiders since he left Goodison Park for Manchester United in 2013. Moyes' pre-match request to fans for patience as he bids to get things right at the Stadium of Light will have carried more weight initially as his side contributed well at first. Ronald Koeman heaped praise on match-winner Lukaku Ronald Koeman heaped praise on match-winner Lukaku Everton always looked a little more likely to score, but Jermain Defoe should have had an opener 10 minutes into the contest. Adnan Januzaj showed great feet on the edge of the area before Defoe was fed via a deflection and he lifted a sloppy effort over the bar. Everton had already had one attempt through Gueye but their next attack was much better, with Lukaku's header saved well by Jordan Pickford after Bolasie's right-wing cross. Jermain Defoe missed a good early chance in a more even first half Lukaku had another go soon after as he and Jack Rodwell traded opportunities at opposite ends before Lynden Gooch also forced Maarten Stekelenburg into a decent stop. Everton made a tactical switch at the break as Ross Barkley was replaced by Gerard Deulofeu and the change brought rewards as the tempo increased and they began to dictate much more. Pickford was equal to a wicked dipping effort from Bolasie then Deulofeu and Lukaku both went close in a move which had players queuing up to tap in. It took an hour for the away side to make their breakthrough and when they did, it was through Lukaku. David Moyes admitted his side were poor at the Stadium of Light David Moyes admitted his side were poor at the Stadium of Light Gueye's lofted ball to the back post was perfect and Lukaku rose to nod in and end a run of 1,139 minutes without netting. Just eight minutes later, he had his second, supplied this time with a sumptuous cross from Bolasie which he again headed over line. By now, Sunderland were in disarray and Everton were given far too much space in central midfield with Mirallas eventually threading through Lukaku, whose stroked finish was emphatic and drew little effort from Pickford. Leighton Baines and Lukaku react to victory on Monday Night Football Leighton Baines and Lukaku react to victory on Monday Night Football With that, the win was assured and despite Deulofeu's efforts at getting a fourth, manager Ronald Koeman will have to settle for third place in the standings for now.

Chelsea goalkeeper Courtois (centre) appears dejected First, Sigurdsson levelled from the spot after Courtois brought him down with a rash sliding challenge; the Iceland international becoming Swansea's top Premier League scorer with 26 goals in the process. Fer then profited after Gary Cahill, who thought he was fouled, was caught in possession with the Dutchman squeezing the ball past Courtois and over the line. Leroy Fer scored Swansea's second Oscar headed over from point-blank range as time ran out for the visitors, but Chelsea continued to push forward and were rewarded in the 81st minute when Costa converted Branislav Ivanovic's deflected shot in style with an acrobatic effort.

Kevin De Bruyne handed City a deserved lead early on, slotting home from just outside the area having run through one-on-one, before Kelechi Iheanacho's simple finish made it 2-0 on 36 minutes, reacting after De Bruyne had hit the post. On his Premier League debut, Claudio Bravo's failure to deal with a deep cross led to Zlatan Ibrahimovic halving the deficit with a volley, while De Bruyne hit the post again for the visitors during a frantic second half full of a chances for both sides. Kevin De Bruyne celebrates the opening goal with Nolito The result means Pep Guardiola's City continue their 100 per cent start to the season, and in-turn gives the Spaniard his eighth victory over a Jose Mourinho side in 17 meetings. Mourinho sprung up a surprise before kick-off, giving Jesse Lingard and Henrikh Mkhitaryan their first Premier League starts of the season, while Guardiola changed his full-backs, bringing in Bacary Sagna and Aleksandar Kolarov. After dominating possession early on, City took the lead on 15 minutes, De Bruyne getting ahead of Daley Blind after Iheanacho's headed flick-on before giving De Gea the eyes from 20 yards. De Bruyne slots past De Gea for 1-0 in the first half City continued to press, and were 2-0 up with nine minutes of the half remaining through Iheanacho, the man given the nod to replace the suspended Sergio Aguero. After De Bruyne had hit the bottom of the far post from an angle, the ball fell kindly for Iheanacho to slot home for his 15th goal in a City shirt. Mourinho's United were stunned, and it showed in their nervousness on the ball, but Bravo handed them a passage back into the game three minutes before half-time. Henrikh Mkhitaryan vies with Manchester City's Aleksandar Kolarov and David Silva Coming out to collect a deep free-kick from Wayne Rooney, the Chilean's weak punch fell into the path of Ibrahimovic, who carefully placed the ball home from 18 yards on the half-volley. Bravo was at it again moments later, racing out to clear the ball before Lingard, who got there before him and laid the ball on for Ibrahimovic, whose weak effort was cleared off the line. Mourinho hooked Mkhitaryan and Lingard at the break, bringing on Marcus Rashford and Ander Herrera, and it was United who started the second half the fastest. Pep Guardiola (right) reacts on the touchline at Old trafford Ibrahimovic slammed the ball over the bar from Rashford's left-wing cross, before his half-volley from Marouane Fellaini's knock-down flew the same direction. Bravo could have seen red moments later, flying in with studs up on Rooney after a heavy touch inside the area, but referee Mark Clattenburg was unmoved. Kevin De Bruyne put in a man of the match performance in a very entertaining Manchester derby which City won 2-1 Kevin De Bruyne put in a man of the match performance in a very entertaining Manchester derby which City won 2-1 United had the ball in the net with 20 minutes remaining, Rashford's effort taking a touch off Ibrahimovic and drifting past Bravo, but the Swede had crept into an offside position. All the chances then fell to City. First, Fernandinho's header from De Bruyne's corner was acrobatically saved by De Gea, before Bailly denied Nolito at the rebound. Pep Guardiola was left very pleased with his side's all-round display as they beat local rivals Manchester United 2-1 at Old Trafford.

De Bruyne, who was played through by substitute Leroy Sane, then hit the near post from inside the area, and saw the ball agonisingly roll across the line and clear. David Silva's curling effort then went inches over De Gea's bar moments later, before an onslaught on City's goal in the final five minutes. Nicolas Otamendi did superbly to block Rooney inside the area, and the Argentine was at it again a minute later to clear Ibrahimovic's knock-down for the England striker inside the six-yard box. United pressed and pressed in stoppage time, Ibrahimovic seeing his effort deflected just wide from 20 yards, but City eventually held on for a vital win.

"report": "Sign in to watch highlights of Arsenal 2-1 Southampton Sign in to watch highlights of Arsenal 2-1 Southampton Santi Cazorla's added-time penalty earned Arsenal all three points at the Emirates as they came from behind to beat Southampton 2-1. The feelgood factor sparked by the inclusion of new signings Shkodran Mustafi and Lucas Perez was in danger of dissipating completely when Petr Cech's own goal put a lively Saints side in front. But Laurent Koscielny's scissor-kick levelled the scores before the break and Cazorla kept his nerve to win it from 12 yards after Jose Fonte was penalised for dragging down substitute Olivier Giroud. It was harsh on Saints, who had to dig in after half-time as Cazorla's catalogue of shimmies and sleights of foot sparked attack after Arsenal attack, but who also wasted two clear opportunities to score a second on the break. Claude Puel is still searching for a first Saints win, while his former Monaco mentor Wenger can celebrate back-to-back victories that will go some way to settling the unrest of the opening-weekend defeat to Liverpool. The Gunners boss' decision to spend before the deadline met with the obvious approval of the home crowd, and there were signs of promise from both new signings. Virgil van Dijk tackles Lucas Perez during the Premier League match between Arsenal and Southampton Mustafi's appeal to Wenger was obvious as he showed composure in possession - a little too much for comfort, at times - and a willingness to pass out from the back. It was less clear on first look how much of an impact Perez might have in the longer term: if the Spaniard is to succeed as Arsenal's central striker he will have to find a way of adapting to the deep starting point often taken up by opposition centre-halves at the Emirates. Arsene Wenger was relieved that his Arsenal side managed to find a late goal against what he describes as a good Sotuhampton side. Arsene Wenger was relieved that his Arsenal side managed to find a late goal against what he describes as a good Sotuhampton side. The blueprint laid down by Virgil van Dijk and Fonte worked in negating the threat of Perez's pace and will be followed to the letter by many a visitor to north London this season. Saints' game-plan looked like it might cause an upset even after they had surrendered the lead, earned when Dusan Tadic's free-kick was tipped onto the bar by Cech, only for the ball to cannon off his back and over the line (18). Koscielny produced a cracker on his 31st birthday to even it up, executing a textbook overhead kick after Saints failed to clear a corner (29), and the momentum was with Arsenal heading into the second half. Laurent Koscielny celebrates scoring Arsenal's equaliser at the Emirates Stadium But Fraser Forster was rarely called into action as Hector Bellerin and Alexis Sanchez - starting on the bench after an arduous international break and with Tuesday's trip to Paris in mind - missed the target and Giroud headed the outstanding Cazorla's chip into the side netting. The clearer openings came at the other end, Long dinking Tadic's smart backheel six yards wide of Cech's goal and then scuffing a follow-up after the Arsenal 'keeper had beaten out Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg's drive. Southampton manager Claude Puel said the defeat to Arsenal is difficult to take given the manner in which the penalty was given against his side. Southampton manager Claude Puel said the defeat to Arsenal is difficult to take given the manner in which the penalty was given against his side. Referee Bobby Madley's contribution to the winning goal may be questioned by the visitors, who complained long and hard about the penalty award and also felt Long had been fouled in an incident that kick-started Arsenal's surge upfield. A succession of Saints attempted to distract Cazorla as treatment for Koscielny delayed the kick, but the Spaniard spotted Forster's hasty move left, and fired the other side to settle the argument.

The hosts gathered the ball following Foster's parry, and the ball ricocheted into Wilson's path, but he volleyed over at an angle with the goal at his mercy. Berahino then went close for the visitors just before the half-time whistle, but he volleyed over after chesting the ball down in the area.

After the break, West Brom looked revitalised, and a Brendan Galloway cross was too strong for Boruc to hold on to, but the Bournemouth 'keeper was quick to get up and deny Berahino from two yards out. More Boruc heroics followed, this time keeping out McAuley's header from point-blank range just before the hour-mark. Following Wilshere's introduction, Matty Phillips went close for the visitors after over-hitting a cross, but the ball cannoned off the crossbar and away to safety. It was all Bournemouth with 20 minutes to go however, and Stanislas shot straight at Foster despite having plenty of time to place his shot.

With 11 minutes to go, Bournemouth finally broke the deadlock, with Wilson showing great audacity to flick the ball with his heel into the far corner following Adam Smith's low cross. The hosts ran the clock down and held on for their first league victory this campaign, ending their run of eight league games without a win.

Steven Defour had struck a wonderful solo goal to put the home side in front and it looked like they were heading for their second win of the season before Ben Mee brought down Tom Huddlestone on the edge of the box in added time. The Scotland international stepped up to curl an excellent free-kick past Tom Heaton and secure a point in Mike Phelan's fifth match as interim boss of the Tigers. Sean Dyche elected to leave new signings Jeff Hendrick and Patrick Bamford on the bench while Hull named the same starting XI which had narrowly lost 1-0 to Manchester United before the international break. Steven Defour of Burnley (L) takes the ball past Abel Hernandez of Hull City And it was the away side who started the brighter with Burnley goalkeeper Heaton, the man of the match as his side lost 3-0 at Chelsea before the international break, called into action after nine minutes to push away an Abel Hernandez effort from the edge of the box. The hosts started to assert themselves more in the game with George Boyd's scuffed effort from a Burnley corner blocked by Adama Diomande with a real scramble ensuing before Hull cleared their lines.

Johann Berg Gudmundsson of Burnley puts pressure on Andy Robertson The best chance of the half fell to the away side on the stroke of half-time. Snodgrass found the run of David Meyler with a pinpoint pass on the left hand side of the box but the midfielder's first-time effort struck the post and bounced clear. Both sides started the second half with more attacking intent with Diomande and Dean Marney shooting off target from distance for either side before Hull should have taken the lead after 50 minutes. Meyler did well to get to the byline and cut the ball back to Diomande, who was eight yards from goal, but he somehow managed to screw his effort wide when it looked easier to hit the target.

Boyd and Vokes then went close for the hosts before Heaton again denied the visitors, pushing a Snodgrass volley over the bar. Steven Defour of Burnley celebrates scoring his side's goal against Hull However, the home side then took the lead with Defour providing the bit of magic the game had been crying out for. The Belgium international set himself up with a lovely flick in the middle of the park to take Huddlestone and Sam Clucas out of the game before driving on unchecked and lashing an effort past Eldin Jakupovic from around 25 yards out. Hull almost responded immediately but Curtis Davies saw his header from a corner smash off the top of the bar and bounce over. George Boyd and Sam Clucas battle for possession The away side felt they should have had a penalty with six minutes remaining when Heaton parried an effort and chased the loose ball out alongside Ryan Mason who went down under the attention of the goalkeeper but referee Paul Tierney waved away the appeals. It looked as though Hull had run out of time before Mee fouled Huddlestone on the edge of the box, with Snodgrass stepping up to brilliantly curl his set piece past Heaton from the edge of the box.

Daniel Ayala equalised with another towering header from Stewart Downing's corner shortly before half-time, but Palace re-established their advantage just after the break when Zaha capitalised on an error from George Friend to finish past Victor Valdes.

Christian Benteke celebrates after opening the scoring for Crystal Palace The home side will not enjoy replays of the opening goal, when the menacing Zaha was given time and space to cross from the right-hand side. It was bread and butter for Benteke, who met the delivery with a thumping header to spark jubilant celebrations from the travelling fans. Middlesbrough struggled to create openings in response, and Palace almost doubled their lead in the 24th minute.

Middlesbrough were lifted by the equaliser and almost took a half-time lead when Viktor Fischer released Alvaro Negredo on the counter-attack.

Daniel Ayala equalised for Middlesbrough in the 38th minute It was a lucky escape for Palace, who responded in style after the break. James McArthur's pass appeared to be too short for the onrushing Zaha, but Friend miscontrolled the ball and the former Manchester United winger made no mistake with his finish.

Sparks stared to fly on the touchline on 35 minutes when Arnautovic was booked for simulation. Hughes was visibly seething with the decision and took his frustration out by verbally abusing the fourth official. Referee Taylor was called over and sent Hughes to the stands.

However, the balance of the game could've changed if referee Taylor had deemed Victor Wanyama's body check on Giannelli Imbula worthy of a second yellow card. Only a foul was awarded. Eriksen had already tested Shay Given with a 20-yard effort before Son doubled the lead on 55 minutes.

Spurs were now rampant and showing signs of the attacking brilliance that was on show during their title challenge last season. Kyle Walker strode down the right wing on 58 minutes and picked out Alli with a perfect low cross, which was dispatched for the England international's first goal of the season. Stoke's Joe Allen tangles with Spurs midifielder Victor Wanyama The only thing missing from this Spurs performance was a Kane goal - and he got in on the act on 70 minutes as Stoke crumbled. Son went from scorer to provider and flashed a cross into the back post where Kane was waiting. He had time to take a touch and fire into the net for his 50th Premier League goal. Tottenham's club record signing Moussa Sissoko, who joined for £30m from Newcastle, was given 10 minutes to show what he could do and he nearly made it 5-0 but his deflected cross-shot was parried away by Given.

highlights of West Ham 2-4 Watford Watford recovered from 2-0 down to beat West Ham 4-2 at London Stadium as Walter Mazzarri won his first match since taking charge of the club. Michail Antonio's two headers had appeared to put West Ham on course for all three points as half-time approached, both set up by the returning Dimitri Payet. However, Odion Ighalo pulled a goal back with a deflected effort after 41 minutes, before captain Troy Deeney took advantage of a terrible mix-up at the back between James Collins and Adrian to send the visitors in level at the break. And further goals early in the second period from Etienne Capoue and Jose Holebas completed a remarkable comeback for the Hornets, who moved out of the relegation zone as a result. Both teams made four changes from their last games before the international break, with West Ham welcoming back influential midfielders Payet and Manuel Lanzini from injury. West Ham manager Slaven Bilic claims he is angry that his side fell to a 4-2 defeat at home to Watford after holding a 2-0 lead. West Ham manager Slaven Bilic claims he is angry that his side fell to a 4-2 defeat at home to Watford after holding a 2-0 lead. There was also further good news for the home fans, who got to get a first glimpse of striker Simone Zaza, a recent recruit from Juventus, although another summer signing - Sofiane Feghouli - was not fit enough to feature. The visitors were able to hand a first start to Argentina winger Roberto Pereyra, another purchases from the Serie A champions, while Craig Cathcart had recovered from a groin injury to take his place as one of three centre backs. However, Mazzarri was unable to call upon recent new signings Adrian Mariappa and Kenedy for the trip to east London. The Hornets, who were looking to end a poor run of three straight defeats, made the worst possible start to proceedings by falling behind after just five minutes and what is more, it was a soft goal to concede. Jose Holebas (L) vies with Michail Antonio Payet curled in a corner from the left for Antonio to rise powerfully at the near post and head home past Heurelho Gomes, albeit with the aid of a deflection off Deeney's back. If that goal was avoidable, though, there was little Watford could do to prevent the home team's second after 33 minutes, with again that man Payet pulling the strings. The quick-footed France international worked himself some space on the right-hand corner of the box, before picking out the unmarked Antonio with an outrageous Rabona, the second time a West Ham player had produced such a piece of skill after Lanzini earlier in the half. Antonio's simple header, his 10th since the start of last season, brought the Hammers fans to their feet in admiration, with many being ejected from the ground by stewards though for then refusing to sit back down. Watford, however, were more than a little unfortunate to find themselves 2-0 down at that point after Ighalo had missed a glorious opening early on, while the visitors were a constant threat on the break. Walter Mazzarri believes his Watford players were affected by playing at the London Stadium but they grew in to the game as it went on Walter Mazzarri believes his Watford players were affected by playing at the London Stadium but they grew in to the game as it went on The goal that brought the Hornets back into the contest had a touch of luck about it after Ighalo, who was released down the left by Capoue, cut in and saw his goalbound effort take a wicked deflection off Collins to wrong-foot Adrian. However, if that was slightly fortunate then the West Ham - who had switched to a flat back four after their previous defeat at Manchester City - only had themselves to blame for Watford's equaliser in first-half stoppage time after a piece of poor communication between Collins and Adrian. The ever-alert Deeney took advantage to nip in between the dithering duo and steal the ball, although the forward still had a lot of work to do to find the back of the net with a delicious chip over a covering defender on the line. That goal appeared to knock the stuffing out of Slaven Bilic's men, who found themselves trailing for the first time in the game following a brilliant strike by Capoue eight minutes after half-time.

It was new boy Pereyra, though, who deserves much of the credit after the forward found his team-mate with a lovely cross, before the Frenchman rifled the ball past Adrian at his near post for his third goal in just four encounters this season. And any hopes West Ham may have had about getting back into the contest were ended after 63 minutes when Holebas scored a fourth goal after fine approach play down the left-hand channel of the area by Ighalo. The Nigerian then cleverly pulled the ball back for the waiting left back to place a well-struck shot past Adrian, who got a hand to the ball, but could not keep it out as West Ham's afternoon went from bad to worse.

"Highlights from Anfield as Liverpool beat Leicester 4-1. Highlights from Anfield as Liverpool beat Leicester 4-1. Two goals from Roberto Firmino helped Liverpool beat Leicester City 4-1 in the first game at the renovated Anfield on Saturday evening. An attendance of 53,075 - Liverpool's largest since 1977 - watched the hosts go in front after 13 minutes through the Brazilian, before Sadio Mane doubled their advantage in the 31st minute. A disastrous error from Lucas Leiva allowed Jamie Vardy to cut the deficit, but Adam Lallana restored Liverpool's two-goal advantage with a stunning strike shortly after half-time. Firmino then added further gloss to the scoreline in the 89th minuute, passing the ball into an empty net after Kasper Schmeichel mistimed his challenge on Mane. Jurgen Klopp's side produced the perfect attacking performance to open the new £115m Main Stand, scoring four goals for the second time in four Premier League matches. The result sees them climb to fifth in the table, while Leicester drop to 15th and turn their attention to a first Champions League fixture against Club Brugge on Wednesday. Roberto Firmino celebrates after scoring the opening goal of the game Claudio Ranieri picked the same starting XI that beat Swansea, but they found themselves a goal down early on. James Milner, in for Alberto Moreno at left-back, picked out Firmino and the Liverpool forward skipped inside Robert Huth and wrong-footed Schmeichel. The hosts were well on top and could have extended their lead when Mane teed up Daniel Sturridge, but the England international saw his close-range effort expertly saved by the Foxes stopper. It was a temporary reprieve for the visitors, though, as Mane latched onto Sturridge's audacious back-heel and chipped past Schmeichel. Adam Lallana scores Liverpool's third goal of the game at Anfield It was no more than Liverpool deserved for their fast start, but a shocking mistake from Lucas gifted the visitors a route back into the match seven minutes before half-time. A poor first touch from the Brazilian put him under pressure, and his attempted pass presented Vardy with the easiest of opportunities. There was a question mark over whether the goal should have stood, though, as Shinji Okazaki appeared to be in the 18-yard box before the ball had left the penalty area from Simon Mignolet's goal kick. Despite being second best for much of the half, Leicester almost went in level as Robert Huth's looping header bounced off the crossbar and over. Danny Drinkwater looks on as Lallana (left) shoots and scores Liverpool's third goal Claudio Ranieri introduced Ahmed Musa at half-time as Leicester look to capitalise on their good fortune, but they soon slipped further behind as Lallana rifled into the top corner for Liverpool's third in the 56th minute. Vardy squandered the chance for an immediate reply, blasting straight at Mignolet after a fine through ball by Riyad Mahrez. The champions attempted to build pressure as the game wore on, but the better chances fell to their opponents as Jordan Henderson blazed over and Schmeichel denied Mane. The Leicester goalkeeper was at fault for Liverpool's fourth in the closing stages, rushing out of his goal and missing his tackle on Mane, who teed up Firmino to grab his second goal of the season.

side picked up a point to stay unbeaten Middlesbrough continued their unbeaten start to the Premier League season after a 0-0 draw at West Brom in a game where chances were few and far between. The hosts had the better of the first half, with James McClean denied by a fine save from Brad Guzan, before Salomon Rondon went close to connecting with a dangerous cross. Saido Berahino made an appearance in the second half, after Tony Pulis revealed he benched the 23-year-old to \"clear his mind\" as speculation over his future continues, but he couldn't inspire his side to victory. Adam Forshaw (left) and Darren Fletcher in action The result sees Boro climb into the top six, while the Baggies are up to 10th. Tony Pulis made three changes to the hosts' line-up, with 18-year-old Sam Field making his first-team bow for the Baggies, and immediately he looked at home in the heart of midfield. McClean was the main threat for the Baggies in the opening period, and had the chance of the half on 12 minutes, with his touch letting him down at the last, allowing Guzan to race from his line to smother in the Boro goal. Gareth McAuley (right) and Alvaro Negredo challenge for the ball Guzan again had to get down to smartly gather a low drive from another Baggies debutant, Brendan Galloway, before Rondon failed to get on the end of a fizzed cross as the half drew to a close. Replays showed the Baggies hitman may have had his shirt pulled as he stooped to connect. After the break Gaston Ramirez sliced wide from the angle after being played in by Emilio Nsue as Boro grew into the match. Down the other end, Craig Dawson went close with a header from a corner, which flashed past the post, with Guzan beaten. James McClean has his shot saved by Brad Guzan Berahino's appearance failed to inject any enthusiasm into the match, with fans voicing their discontent at the sight of the controversial hitman. The visitors had their first effort on target in the 74th minute, but Cristhian Stuani's tame effort was easily gathered by a previously redundant Ben Foster in the home goal. Stewart Downing fizzed an effort wide late on, but a goal didn't materialise on a cagey afternoon in the Midlands.

Sterling started and finished the scoring (7, 90+2) while Fernandinho grabbed the other at the Etihad Stadium as an impressive City side held off a West Ham fightback after Michail Antonio halved the deficit midway through the second half. Pep Guardiola's side have moved top of the early table on goal difference but Sergio Aguero could face retrospective action from the FA after he appeared to aim an elbow at West Ham defender Winston Reid during the closing stages. City - who named Willy Cabellero in goal with new signing Claudio Bravo not yet involved - were ahead inside seven minutes as they quickly stamped their authority on a much-changed West Ham side. Slaven Bilic had opted to switch his formation to 5-3-2 following their Europa League defeat to Astra Giurgiu on Thursday, but the tie didn't start as he would have planned. Manchester City's Fernandinho celebrates scoring his side's second goal of the game David Silva started a wonderful move for the home side, roaming through the West Ham defence before finding Nolito out wide on the left. The Spain international cut a cross behind the West Ham back-line to Sterling, who found the corner of the net for City's first of the game and his first of the season. Guardiola's side continued to apply the pressure on a lacklustre West Ham side after their opener, and it only took another 11 minutes for them to double their lead. Michail Antonio (right) scored for West Ham in the second half A simple free kick on the right flank was whipped in perfectly by Kevin De Bruyne, and Fernandinho was there to rise highest and power a header past a helpless Adrian to score his first goal in nearly a year. As the second half got underway, it appeared the match was only heading in one direction as City continued to pepper Adrian's goal. Nolito thought he had made the score 3-0 just minutes after the restart when he chested past the goalkeeper, but the linesman's flag was up for an obvious offside. While it seemed to be a guaranteed simple home win midway through the second period, from nowhere, West Ham turned the game on its head to pull one back in the 58th minute. Sterling completed the scoring from close range in injury time Arthur Masuaku - much improved from previous performances in the West Ham defence - lifted a cross from the left towards the back post, where Antonio was waiting. Peeling off Gael Clichy to outjump Nicolas Otamendi, the former Nottingham Forest winger headed past Willy Caballero to make it 2-1. From there, City looked nervous as they clung on to their lead heading into the final 20 minutes. Aguero enjoyed an impressive outing despite not scoring, although he may have been lucky to stay on the pitch after an incident late on. Sergio Aguero clashes with Winston Reid during Manchester City's 3-1 victory over West Ham As he jumped to challenge Reid in the 76th minute, the striker appeared to aim an elbow in his opponent's direction, with the West Ham man having to come off injured. With the Manchester derby next up for City, Guardiola and co will be hoping the decision lands in their favour. Back on the pitch, City were able to confirm their win with just two minutes remaining in added time. Sterling was the best player on the pitch on Sunday, and it was fitting that he secured the result. Silva hit the post seconds before the goal, and he was again at the centre of play as he set up Sterling for his goal. The England forward collected the ball before taking it round Adrian to finish from the tightest of angles. Reid is attended to by a physio, and Aguero (left) could yet face a retrospective ban Guardiola has now overseen three Premier League wins from three games as Manchester City manager.

earned Tottenham a point against Liverpool as they drew 1-1 in the Premier League on Saturday. The Reds took the lead late in the first half after Erik Lamela clipped Roberto Firmino just inside the box and James Milner converted the penalty. After having few chances, Tottenham burst into the game with half an hour to play and made it count as Danny Rose volleyed home in the 72nd minute to earn a point for the hosts. Tottenham started the brighter but it was Liverpool who should have taken an early lead as Firmino was released by Sadio Mane in the box. Philippe Coutinho, in space on the right, took aim - but Michel Vorm got down to make a save at the near post. Danny Rose scores for Tottenham against Liverpool in the Premier League The Spurs goalkeeper kept the Brazilian playmaker at bay twice more during the first half, with his second a mirror image of the first as Coutinho was once again found in space but saw his effort saved low at the post. Kyle Walker was replaced by Vincent Janssen in the 28th minute after suffering with illness, and the striker should have had a penalty four minutes later. He raced into the box but was grappled by Premier League debutante Joel Matip - but referee Bobby Madley remained unmoved much to the anger of the home fans. Jurgen Klopp says it is extremely disappointing Liverpool did not leave White Hart Lane with all three points following their 1-1 draw Jurgen Klopp says it is extremely disappointing Liverpool did not leave White Hart Lane with all three points following their 1-1 draw Madley reacted only to speak to the players when Jan Vertonghen grappled with Matip at a Liverpool corner but 10 minutes later, he did point to the spot in favour of the Reds as Lamela was judged to have clipped Firmino just inside the box. Milner who stepped up to send Vorm the wrong way and put the Reds ahead just before half-time. Liverpool were dominant in the second half, with Firmino playing in Georginio Wijnaldum whose effort just goes over the bar before Matip just headed over the crossbar from a Milner corner. The Reds should have added a second to their tally in the 57th minute, as Wijnaldum played in Lallana, who in turn set up Mane to power the ball into the back of the net - but the flag was already raised for offside against the England international much to the dismay of Mane who was already celebrating.

The hosts were back on terms in the 72nd minute as Dier whipped in a cross from the right flank, with the ball ricocheting off the head of Lamela and falling into the path of Rose at the back post. The England defender was afforded the time and space to compose himself and squeeze a volley past Mignolet. James Milner scores from the penalty spot at White Hart Lane Daniel Sturridge was dropped to the bench after scoring twice in midweek, although not without voicing his frustrations at being played out wide against Burnley, and came on as a late substitute in the 88th minute. Spurs went the closest to grabbing the winner in the closing stages as Alderweireld again headed over the bar, but it ended level with both sides ultimately deserving of a point.

The result ensures Conte maintains his flawless Premier League record as Chelsea boss, with three victories from his first three games, and sees the Blues enter the international break top of the league, albeit temporarily. Burnley remain on three points having followed last week's victory over Liverpool with a toothless showing in which they failed to register a single shot on target. Willian of Chelsea celebrates scoring his side's second goal Willian returned to the Chelsea line-up, replacing Pedro, after overcoming calf trouble as Conte made one change to the side that won at Watford last weekend. Sean Dyche, meanwhile, tried to replicate his side's victory over Liverpool by naming an unchanged side, but, from the first whistle, it was clear the Clarets were in for a torrid afternoon. It took just nine minutes for the hosts to open the scoring as the Hazard broke forward on a counter, cut inside two flailing Burnley defenders and picked out the bottom corner of Tom Heaton's goal. Eden Hazard of Chelsea scores his side's first goal Unmarked at the far post, the Belgian should have had a second two minutes later as he gathered Nemanja Matic's cross from the right, but Ben Mee, who scored a late equaliser on Burnley's last visit to Stamford Bridge, blocked his effort off the line. Gary Cahill then flashed a volley wide as Chelsea went on to dominate possession, with Burnley not offered a second's respite by the rampant hosts. Willian and Oscar combined brilliantly to get in behind the tiring, static Burnley defence on 37 minutes, but Diego Costa failed to convert the chance, shooting straight at Heaton. Diego Costa (C) in action during the game between Chelsea and Burnley at Stamford Bridge But Chelsea didn't have to wait long for their second as Willian drilled home through Stephen Ward's legs, giving Heaton no chance. Scott Arfield spurned a glorious chance reduce the arrears shortly after but he dragged his shot wide, ensuring Chelsea entered the break with a healthy lead. The second half followed the trend of the first, with Burnley starved of possession and Chelsea at their flowing best, although John Terry failed to follow the script on 56 minutes, missing the target from close range after Heaton had parried Hazard's shot into his path. Antonio Conte reacts on the touchline at Stamford Bridge Heaton continued to single-handedly keep Chelsea at bay, thwarting both Hazard and Costa as the half wore on. That resilience saw Burnley grow in confidence, but they lacked the quality to penetrate the Chelsea rearguard. Conte then wrestled the initiative back, freshening things up by bringing Moses, Michy Batshuayi and Pedro off the bench. Victor Moses celebrates after scoring Chelsea's third goal of the game And it worked wonders as the Batshuayi and Pedro combined to set up Moses for his second goal in a week, after his strike against Bristol Rovers in the EFL Cup.

Josh King had given the Cherries a well-deserved lead after just 11 minutes before Palace midfielder Yohan Cabaye saw his penalty saved by Artur Boruc. Eddie Howe's away side were hanging on for long periods in the second half but centre-back Dann powered home a Jason Puncheon cross in the third minute of stoppage time to finally reward Palace's pressure. Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew gave a Premier League debut to club-record £27m signing Christian Benteke, while Bournemouth were unchanged from last week's 1-0 loss at West Ham United. Scott Dann (C) is mobbed after his equaliser earned a point The Cherries struck first when King controlled Harry Arter's pass on his chest, before expertly firing past goalkeeper Steve Mandanda and into the bottom corner. But Bournemouth barely had time to compose themselves when Benteke was fouled by Charlie Daniels inside the area, and referee Mike Dean wasted no time in pointing to the spot. Cabaye stepped forward, but his effort was comfortably saved by Boruc as the France international spurned the chance to draw level. Joshua King celebrates scoring for Bournemouth Jordon Ibe and Callum Wilson were proving a real handful for the home side, forcing Palace to concede a number of unnecessary free-kicks out in wide positions, something which would continue to be a theme of the opening 45 minutes. Pardew's half-time team-talk appeared to do the trick as Palace began with far more intensity, but Dann wasted a good opportunity with a bullet header. It was very much a backs-to-the-wall job for Eddie Howe's men, as the Palace pressure showed no sign of relenting, with Connor Wickham blasting over the bar when well placed to score. Christian Benteke won the penalty but had a mixed game Ryan Fraser managed to make a rare break for Bournemouth, but he was wrongly flagged for offside, despite the replays clearly showing he was being played on. With Pardew feeling the need for even more urgency, Tottenham target Wilfried Zaha was introduced along with Lee Chung-yong and the pair injected pace and directness to keep the Bournemouth defence on their toes. Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe described Crystal Palace’s late goal against his side as a ‘sickener’ Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe described Crystal Palace’s late goal against his side as a ‘sickener’ A stinging shot from Andros Townsend was well held by Boruc and minutes later, Zaha really should have scored, but was unable to adjust his feet to flick the ball over the line. It was a mixed afternoon for Benteke - who after winning that first-half penalty, had little effect on the game and when he fell to the ground in theatrical fashion, Townsend was unable to capitalise and blasted into the side netting. Alan Pardew hopes Palace's late equaliser against Bournemouth at Selhurst Park will provide a springboard for future success Alan Pardew hopes Palace's late equaliser against Bournemouth at Selhurst Park will provide a springboard for future success The man-of-the-match award was by no means a certainty in this game, but Boruc was doing all he could to claim that honour and pulled off an incredible point blank save from Lee, who looked to have scored, but found the Poland international in inspired form. But, with just seconds remaining, Dann - who had spent the final minutes as an auxiliary forward - came to the rescue, heading in Puncheon's cross as Boruc was finally beaten.

Koeman as Shay Given’s unfortunate own goal handed them a 1-0 over Stoke City at Goodison Park. Phil Bardsley conceded a penalty for tripping Ashley Williams in the box just after half-time and, though Given did brilliantly to tip Leighton Baines' spot-kick onto the post, the ball rebounded into the net off his head. Stoke pushed for an equaliser in the second half with Marko Arnautovic their primary threat but were unable to beat the excellent Everton goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg. After a scrappy opening, the game's first moment of real quality came from Kevin Mirallas on the edge of the box when he skipped past Glenn Whelan and drilled a low shot which Given got down smartly to save. Leighton Baines of Everton celebrates his side's first goal It was Stoke who looked more composed in the first quarter with Joe Allen seeing a lot of the ball as he enjoyed a free role in midfield. Peter Crouch started for the Potters after his hat-trick against Stevenage in the EFL Cup on Tuesday and Stoke targeted him with floated crosses from the right. He was isolated with 19-year-old Mason Holgate at the back post on one of those balls from Bardsley but elected to attempt a scissors kick and that allowed the Everton defender to head clear. Everton manager Ronald Koeman rued the number of missed chances from his side against Stoke Everton manager Ronald Koeman rued the number of missed chances from his side against Stoke The best chance of the first half fell to Ashley Williams in the 24th minute when he headed a corner downwards past Given but Crouch hooked the ball clear off the line. Yannick Bolasie, who was starting his first league game for Everton, cut a frustrated figure on the right wing during the first quarter but a switch to the left helped him grow into the game as the game wore on and Everton finished the half well on top. Everton picked up where they left off in the second half with Barkley going close with a low shot that flew inches wide before Holgate and Lukaku combined for a lovely one-two in the box that forced Ryan Shawcross to make a brilliant challenge to prevent a certain goal. Stoke manager Mark Hughes suggested the decision to give Everton a penalty against his Stoke side was harsh. Stoke manager Mark Hughes suggested the decision to give Everton a penalty against his Stoke side was harsh. It was from the resulting corner that the pivotal moment in the game came as Bardsley clipped Williams' heel as the pair ran towards the ball and Everton went ahead thanks to Given's misfortune. Stoke were almost level just before the hour mark as Arnautovic got onto the end of a flick on from Crouch and found a yard of space before drilling a low shot which Stekelenburg did brilliantly to save up onto the crossbar. Everton almost made it two on 78 minutes when Barkley showed brilliant skill to flick the ball past Shawcross to get one-on-one with Given, but the Irishman got down well to save his low shot.

Stoke went straight up the other end and almost scored again. Arnautovic got clean through on goal but, at a tight angle, elected to square the ball to substitute Jonathan Walters, who was unmarked five yards out, but the Irishman was not anticipating the pass and could not adjust in time. Everton held on to win and will go into the international break with seven points from their opening three fixtures while Stoke sit bottom of the table with just one point on the board so far.

Francesco Guidolin kept faith with the same starting XI that lost 2-0 to Premier League new boys Hull last week, while Scotland U21 striker Oliver McBurnie was included on the bench following his impressive double against Peterborough United in the midweek EFL Cup win. Morgan bagged Leicester's second The home fans were in full voice after Claudio Ranieri's side started on the front foot with Federico Fernandez booked for hacking down Vardy, although Mahrez wasted the resulting opportunity when he blasted his free-kick over the crossbar. Gylfi Sigurdsson attempted to beat Schmeichel with a right-foot curler from just outside the area, but the Denmark international positioned himself well to get behind it. The hosts continued to dominate possession and deservedly broke the deadlock after 32 minutes. Christian Fuchs (L) and Swansea's Federico Fernandez battle for the ball Drinkwater's defence-splitting pass was collected by Vardy ahead of Jordi Amat, and the champions' leading scorer last season with 24 goals, strode away to lash his right-foot strike home off the near post . The England international bagged his sixth goal in his last seven top-flight appearances and it proved to be his first Premier League goal of the season to give his side lift-off. Seven minutes into the second half, Leicester captain Morgan doubled the advantage on his 200th game for the club. It came from a corner kick which the visitors failed to clear with the former Nottingham Forest defender on hand to crash the ball high into the roof of the net. Leroy Fer pulled a goal back for Swansea After 55 minutes, Amat brought down Shinji Okazaki for a clear penalty, but Mahrez failed to take advantage as Lukasz Fabianski made a fine save to deny him and then Okazaki from the follow up. Schmeichel was forced off through injury and was replaced by Ron-Robert Zieler, but the substitute 'keeper was helpless to prevent Fer from pulling a late goal back for Swansea with a towering header from Modou Barrow's superb delivery. But it was Leicester who held out for the final few minutes as Ranieri celebrated his 100th Premier League game as a manager with all three points as his side extend their unbeaten home record to 17 top-flight games.

The Black Cats looked to be heading for three points after Jermain Defoe hammered in a penalty in the closing stages. But substitute Rodriguez scored his first top-flight goal since March 2014 when he equalised six minutes from time after his shot went under the body of Jordan Pickford, who was deputising for the injured Vito Mannone. Saints will feel they deserved a point after creating a string of chances and were the brighter side in the opening stages with Dusan Tadic firing a shot inches over, while Charlie Austin's fierce strike from outside the box was beaten away by Pickford. Austin was then flagged offside after scuffing a shot from close range which was saved by the goalkeeper. Jermain Defoe of Sunderland celebrates scoring his side's goal The Black Cats improved in the closing stages of the half and spurned a glorious opportunity when Lamine Kone headed wide from close range. In the build-up Sunderland felt they should have been awarded a penalty when Fabio Borini appeared to be pushed from behind by Jose Fonte. Pickford continued to be at his best in the second half, diving at full stretch to parry Shane Long's low strike from distance before keeping out Redmond's shot at his near post. The visitors broke the deadlock on 79 minutes through a penalty when Defoe was brought down by the trailing leg of Fonte and the striker lashed the ball into net with his spot kick. But their lead lasted just six minutes with Rodriguez, who has battled back from serious knee trouble, saw his low shot from around 20 yards sneak under Pickford. Moyes' side clung on for their first point of the season while Southampton make it two points from their first league games.

Arsene Wenger's side, who had lost at home to Liverpool before drawing with Leicester, took the lead in the ninth minute with Santi Cazorla converting from the penalty spot after Alexis Sanchez was bundled to the ground by Nordin Amrabat. Sanchez doubled the advantage in the 40th minute, converting Theo Walcott's enticing cross before Mesut Ozil added a third in stoppage time at the end of a comfortable first half. Watford, who handed debuts to Roberto Pereyra and Daryl Janmaat at half-time, made a better fist of things after the break and pulled a goal back through Pereyra (57). Arsenal's Alexis Sanchez (right) celebrates with team-mate Mesut Ozil But it proved to be just a consolation as Arsenal made it seven out of seven against Watford in the Premier League. Arsenal made the perfect start when Ozil, who was making his first start of the season, clipped a beautiful ball onto the chest of Sanchez. As the Chilean tried to bring the ball down Amrabat clattered into him and referee Kevin Friend, who took his time over the decision, pointed to the spot. Walcott was on penalty duty and missed in the Gunners' 4-3 opening day defeat but with Cazorla back in the side, the Spaniard took the responsibilities back and made no mistake. Santi Cazorla scores for Arsenal from the penalty spot The early goal put Watford on the back foot with Wenger's men dominating possession, but they had to wait until the 24th minute for their next clear-cut opportunity as Gomes denied Walcott after he latched onto Cazorla's wayward shot at the far post. Despite the visitors' dominance, Watford could have been back on level terms moments later but for Petr Cech's brilliant reactions as he kept out Laurent Koscielny's sliced clearance. It sparked Watford into some sort of life and they went close again as Christian Kabasele, on his Premier League debut, headed wide Etienne Capoue's corner. Santi Cazorla of Arsenal celebrates scoring his side's first goal However, it was Arsenal that finished the first half the stronger of the two sides with Sanchez and Ozil both denied by Heurelho Gomes in quick succession. They weren't to be denied for long though as Walcott picked out Sanchez at the far post in the 40th minute, and while the Chile international did not produce his best finish, he did enough to divert the ball over the line. Six minutes later the Gunners struck another blow and this time Sanchez was the provider, picking out the surging run of Ozil, who headed home from close range. Mesut Ozil celebrates scoring Arsenal's third goal Mazzarri responded by introducing Pereyra at the interval and he marked his debut with a well-taken goal 12 minutes into the second half, bending a strike past Cech to reduce the arrears. Arsenal were still looking dangerous on the counter-attack but Watford were much more potent now and Cech forced into a smart double-save to deny Jose Holebas and Odion Ighalo, before the latter saw an acrobatic overhead kick fly inches over the crossbar. Troy Deeney of Watford controls the ball infront of Granit Xhaka But that was as close as the hosts came to getting a foothold in the contest and it was Arsenal left celebrating a first three-point haul of the campaign.

highlights of Hull 0-1 Man Utd as Marcus Rashford scored a late winner Sign in to watch highlights of Hull 0-1 Man Utd as Marcus Rashford scored a late winner Marcus Rashford scored a dramatic stoppage-time winner to secure a 1-0 victory for Manchester United against Hull City on Saturday. It looked set to be a frustrating evening at the KCOM Stadium for Jose Mourinho's side before substitute Rashford tapped home in the 92nd minute after fine work by Wayne Rooney. United had 29 shots to Hull's eight as they piled on the pressure in the second half, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Paul Pogba, Rooney and Rashford each going close before the latter grabbed his first goal of the season. Marcus Rashford celebrates scoring his side's winning goal at Hull The win maintains United's perfect league record and keeps them second in the table, while Hull's first defeat of the campaign leaves them in fifth. Both teams were unchanged following 2-0 league victories last weekend, but the first chance of the game fell to the visitors. Anthony Martial drifted inside and found Ibrahimovic with a teasing cross, but the striker headed a yard over the crossbar. Tom Huddlestone and his Hull City team-mates appear dejected after Marcus Rashford's goal Robert Snodgrass went closest for Hull midway through the half as his dipping free-kick flashed past the post with David De Gea beaten. United took control of the match before the break, and Rooney and Ibrahimovic both had chances to break the deadlock, with the former seeing his shot cleared off the line by the impressive Curtis Davies. Hull suffered a blow immediately after half-time when Snodgrass, who had suffered a nasty collision with the post in the first half, was unable to continue. Paul Pogba in action for Manchester United at the KCOM Stadium Mourinho introduced Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Rashford as United pushed forward in search of a breakthrough, and the pair made the difference. The visitors had a penalty appeal turned down by referee Jon Moss when Antonio Valencia's cross appeared to strike David Meyler's arm, while Rooney and Ibrahimovic each flashed shots wide of Eldin Jakupovic's post. Rashford drew a fine stop from the Hull 'keeper with a low effort and the Tigers rode their luck as Davies had Jakupovic to thank for preventing an own goal after his miscued clearance. Mike Phelan's side had two chances to snatch an unlikely winner themselves, but Tom Huddlestone's long-range strike deflected wide with De Gea stranded and Meyler then blazed over. Marcus Rashford wheels away after his late winner at the KCOM Stadium It proved costly too, as Rooney beat Ahmed Elmohamady down United's left and teed up Rashford, who finished neatly to become the first teenager to score a Premier League goal under a Mourinho-managed side. It sets up United for a date with rivals Man City after the international break, live on Sky Sports, while Hull must pick themselves up to face Burnley at Turf Moor.

Sunderland 1-2 Middlesbrough Watch highlights of Sunderland 1-2 Middlesbrough David Moyes' first home game in charge of Sunderland ended in defeat as Cristhian Stuani's brace handed Middlesbrough a 2-1 victory in the Wear-Tees derby. In the 143rd meeting between the two North-East sides, Stuani's unstoppable long-range drive broke the deadlock at the Stadium of Light on 13 minutes. The Uruguay international doubled the visitors' advantage on the stroke of half-time, rounding off a fine team move, as Sunderland left the field to a chorus of boos from home supporters. Patrick van Aanholt reduced the arrears on 71 minutes but, despite an improved second-half display, Boro held on for their first Premier League win of the season, while Sunderland remain winless from their first two games. Moyes handed summer signings Adnan Januzaj, Paddy McNair and Papy Djilododji their home debuts, while Aitor Karanka also made three changes for the trip to Wearside, the most notable of which seeing goalkeeper Brad Guzan replace the injured Victor Valdes. Keen to make an impression, Manchester United loanee Januzaj was the focal point of the Sunderland attack as the hosts dominated the opening exchanges. But, against the run of play, Boro drew first blood. Christian Stuani's double ensured Middlesbrough took all three points in the north East derby Having carried the ball into the Sunderland half in one of the visitors' first ventures into opposition territory, Stuani stunned the hosts, picking out the top corner of the Vito Mannone's goal from 25 yards in spectacular fashion. The goal knocked the stuffing out of Sunderland and they struggled to continue their promising start. They didn't fashion a chance until the half-hour mark, where Jermain Defoe's glancing heading, after Guzan had saved his low shot, was rightfully ruled out for offside. Sunderland's injury woes continued on 35 minutes as captain John O'Shea was forced to withdraw, handing Boro the initiative to see out the game as the interval approached. Manchester United loanee Adnan Januzaj made his home debut for Sunderland But they went one better as Alvaro Negredo, having been played in behind the makeshift home defence by Adam Forshaw, selflessly squared to Stuani, and he stroked home his second. Jeremain Lens was brought on at half-time as Moyes looked to mastermind a comeback on his home debut, and his team responded with a stirring second-half rally. Van Aanholt drew Guzan into a superb low save on the hour, and the pressure finally told as the Boro 'keeper spilled Duncan Watmore's shot into the path of Dutch full-back and he converted 19 minutes from time to set up a tense finale. Brad Guzan makes a save from Patrick van Aarnholt during Middlesbrough's match with Sunderland. However, having clawed themselves back into contention, Sunderland failed to complete the turnaround as Boro regathered themselves to claim the first north-East bragging rights of the season following their return to the top flight.

For most of the afternoon, it looked as though the Hammers were set to be frustrated on their league debut at their new home, with clear chances scarce at either end. However, after Harry Arter was shown a second yellow card for bringing down Cheikhou Kouyate, the hosts got the breakthrough as Antonio headed home from Gokhan Tore's cross in the 85th minute. Adrian pulled off a sharp save to deny Josh King in injury-time and Jonathan Calleri spurned a brilliant chance for a goal on his Premier League debut when he shot wide with just the keeper to beat. West Ham were playing at the London Stadium for the first time in the league Before Arter's dismissal there had been little to excite a club-record attendance of 56,977, as the action on the pitch failed to match the occasion. The Hammers were not helped by the unavailability of a number of first-team players, including striker Andy Carroll, who is facing a few weeks out with a knee injury. Mark Noble crosses as Harry Arter, who was sent off in the 78th minute, attempts a block Dimitri Payet and Sofiane Feghouli were also not involved, along with club-record signing Andre Ayew, who has been ruled out for several months after suffering a thigh injury in the opening game against Chelsea. Bournemouth made one change from last weekend as Ryan Fraser replaced Lewis Cook. Michail Antonio celebrates his winner for West Ham In their only previous competitive match at the London Stadium, in the Europa League, the Hammers scored twice in the first half, but a repeat of that looked unlikely throughout a tight opening 45 minutes. While the hosts dominated possession, they struggled to create any clear chances. Gokhan Tore shot over the bar and then might have won a penalty when he was fouled right on the edge of the box by Charlie Daniels, with a free-kick given instead. Slaven Bilic says West Ham's first Premier League win at the London Stadium is big for the club Slaven Bilic says West Ham's first Premier League win at the London Stadium is big for the club It took until the 40th minute for the first shot on target as Artur Boruc kept out a near-post shot from Enner Valencia. The visitors rarely threatened in the opening 45 minutes, but went close after the interval as Josh King's long-range shot was brilliantly tipped over by Adrian. Eddie Howe felt his side edged the game and were stung by a single lapse in concentration Eddie Howe felt his side edged the game and were stung by a single lapse in concentration At the other end, Tore volleyed into the side netting, but opportunities remained at a premium until Arter was dismissed in the 78th minute for bringing down Kouyate. The Hammers then pressed for a winner and it was Antonio who delivered, heading home at the back post from Tore's cross. King almost equalised in injury-time when he saw a close-range shot kept out by Adrian, before Calleri raced clear, only to shoot wide.

Highlights as Stoke took on Manchester City in the Premier League. Two goals each for Sergio Aguero and Nolito secured a 4-1 win for Man City against Stoke at the bet365 Stadium on Saturday afternoon. Aguero continued his fine start to the season with his fifth and sixth goals of the campaign to put the visitors in control at half-time. Having missed two penalties in midweek against Steaua Bucharest, he sent Shay Given the wrong way from 12 yards to open the scoring in the 27th minute, and the striker swiftly added a second with a fine header nine minutes later. Nolito scored two late goals for Man City Bojan Krkic pulled one back from the penalty spot for the hosts (49), but Nolito wrapped up the three points for Pep Guardiola's side with two late goals (86, 90+5). Guardiola made one change from Man City's Champions League first-leg win as Willy Caballero continued in goal, and the visitors picked up from where they left off in Romania. Aguero, who hit a hat-trick in the 5-0 victory but fluffed his lines twice from the spot, made no mistake this time after referee Mike Dean penalised Ryan Shawcross' grab on Nicolas Otamendi at a corner. Referee Mike Dean (R) shows Raheem Sterling (L) a yellow card after awarding Stoke a penalty Raheem Sterling had twice gone close before Aguero's strike as a jittery Stoke defence struggled to cope with Man City's movement, and the Argentina striker soon doubled their advantage. He rose well to head home from Kevin De Bruyne's delivery to give his side a deserved lead at the break. But a sloppy start gifted Stoke, who had a penalty appeal ignored just before half-time, a route back into the match. Referee Dean had waved away Joe Allen's first-half claim but pointed to the spot when Sterling, tasked with defending Shawcross at a corner, failed to play the ball. Bojan Krkic scored from the penalty spot for the hosts Bojan stepped up for the Potters and confidently finished from 12 yards to halve the deficit. The hosts went close to an equaliser when Allen's curling corner almost caught out Caballero at his near post, and they had another penalty appeal denied when Jon Walters went down under Sterling's challenge with 10 minutes to play. The introduction of Kelechi Iheanacho changed the complexion of the closing stages as the Man City substitute played a key part in Nolito's late double, sealing victory in Guardiola's first Premier League away game. Nolito (R) celebrates his goal with team-mate Raheem Sterling He latched on to David Silva's through ball and rounded Given before showing good composure to square for Nolito, who drilled home his first Premier League goal. The new Man City signing didn't have to wait long for his second, tapping into an empty net deep into stoppage time after Iheanacho's dummy allowed Sterling to race clear and set up his team-mate.

Burnley v Liverpool Sign in now to watch highlights of Burnley v Liverpool Burnley opened their Premier League account for the season as strikes Sam Vokes and Andre Gray secured a 2-0 victory against Liverpool at Turf Moor. Sean Dyche's side, who lost their opening game of the season to Swansea, were in front after just two minutes thanks to Vokes' powerful opener. The hosts doubled their advantage in the 37th minute and it was Vokes' strike partner, Gray, whose right-footed finish left Simon Mignolet with no chance. Liverpool, who were without the injured Sadio Mane, attracted plenty of plaudits for their opening weekend victory against Arsenal but Jurgen Klopp's side put in a lacklustre performance at Turf Moor, struggling to create anything of note. Andre Gray celebrates scoring Burnley's second goal against Liverpool But it was Burnley's afternoon as they claimed their first win over Liverpool at home in the league since 1973. Dyche made one change to the side that lost 1-0 on the opening day, bringing in club record signing Steven Defour into the starting 11 for David Jones. And Burnley made their intentions clear in just the second minute, pressing high with Gray winning the ball back deep in the Liverpool half. Gray then picked out Vokes, who turned on the edge of the penalty area before picking out the corner of the net with an excellent right-footed finish to give the hosts the perfect start. Andre Gray celebrates scoring Burnley's second goal It was a very lacklustre opening from Liverpool, who brought in Daniel Sturridge and James Milner for Alberto Moreno and the injured Mane. Klopp's men were dominating possession but struggling to create clear-cut chances with Philippe Coutinho missing the target and Adam Lallana failing to trouble Tom Heaton. Jurgen Klopp prior to kcik-off at Turf Moor Sturridge was next to go close, curling a left-footed shot from just outside the penalty area inches wide as the frustration continued to build for the visitors. Burnley continued to look a threat on the break with the pace of Gray up front and they doubled their advantage in the 37th minute and it was Defour, who started things off for the hosts. Burnley striker Andre Gray celebrates after scoring against Liverpool The £8m signing for Anderlecht, won the ball from Robert Klavan in the middle of the park before driving to the edge of the penalty area and releasing Gray. The Burnley striker cut back inside past Jordan Henderson and Klavan before picking out the bottom corner to score his first Premier League goal. After the break Liverpool were restricted to long range efforts as Coutinho struck wide and Roberto Firminho forced Heaton into an excellent save. Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp said his side have a ‘lot to learn’ after their 2-0 defeat to Burnley. Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp said his side have a ‘lot to learn’ after their 2-0 defeat to Burnley. Coutinho again sliced wide in the 58th minute as Liverpool's frustrations continued. Burnley, by contrast, were more efficient and clinical with the ball, and patient, tenacious and committed without it. Liverpool had 81 per cent possession and attempted 26 shots, but Heaton was rarely troubled. Marko Grujic, a late substitute for Lallana, forced Heaton into his first real save in the 79th minute but in the end Burnley ran out comfortable winners.

The managerless Tigers were the bookmakers' favourites for relegation after starting the campaign with just 13 fit senior players, but they followed up their shock win over champions Leicester with an impressive victory at the Liberty Stadium. Substitute Maloney put them in front when he turned home Robert Snodgrass' corner just six minutes after coming on, and he was the provider for the second, springing Swansea's offside trap and teeing up Hernandez to finish past Lukasz Fabianski in stoppage time. The win puts Hull third in the Premier League table behind Manchester City and Manchester United, but it was a bitterly disappointing afternoon for the Swans, who dominated for long periods and missed a string of chances in the first half. Madou Barrow of Swansea City battles for the ball with Andrew Robertson of Hull Swansea were swiftly on the front foot on a rainy afternoon in South Wales, with their best chance arriving just six minutes in, when Hull goalkeeper Eldin Jakupovic tipped Gylfi Sigurdsson's 20-yard drive onto the crossbar.

Hull were largely restricted to occasional counter-attacks as they struggled to get out of their own half, but they should have taken the lead on the quarter-hour mark, when Snodgrass fed Adama Diomande in Swansea's box. The striker created space to shoot, but his wild effort flew harmlessly wide. At the other end, Fernando Llorente was proving a handful for the Hull defence, but he could not find a finish as he sent two headers wide. On another occasion he showed strength to pin his marker and tee up Leroy Fer, whose first-time effort went over the bar from eight yards out. Swansea manager Francesco Guidolin says their 2-0 defeat to Hull is very disappointing. Swansea manager Francesco Guidolin says their 2-0 defeat to Hull is very disappointing. Jack Cork sent a long-range shot just past Jakupovic's far post and his Swansea team-mate Wayne Routledge backheeled wide after good work from Modou Barrow, but Hull held on until half-time. Francesco Guidolin's side continued to dominate possession after the break, but the first clear chance went Hull's way, as Snodgrass' low shot was deflected wide following Andrew Robertson's cut-back on the left-hand side. Swansea threw on Jefferson Montero and Ki Sung-yueng in an attempt to find a breakthrough, but Hull defended resiliently, with Curtis Davies and make-shift centre-back Jake Livermore excelling in the heart of their back four. Abel Hernandez celebrates after scoring Hull's second goal Davies forced an acrobatic save from Fabianski 12 minutes from time, but Hull's opener came from the resulting corner, as the Tigers skipper flicked Snodgrass' corner into the path of Maloney. It was a sucker-punch for the home side, but still they struggled to break Hull down. Their best chance came when Kyle Naughton's goalbound drive was blocked by Davies, but the Tigers duly went up the other end to clinch the second goal and wrap up the win.

The summer signing from Southampton headed home from Harry Kane's flick on 82 minutes after the hosts missed a string of chances. Vincent Janssen, also making his full Spurs debut, should have found the net in the second half when he was put through one-on-one with Wayne Hennessey, but shot wide. The visitors struggled to make opportunities, with Michel Vorm's straightforward saves to deny Jason Puncheon and Connor Wickham the closest they came. Palace had the first effort on goal after just two minutes when Puncheon was found by Lee Chung-yong inside the box, but he shot straight at Vorm, who replaced the injured Hugo Lloris. The visitors would rarely get the ball up-field for the rest of the first half, and only ex-Spurs winger Andros Townsend had another attempt on goal from distance, while Spurs peppered Palace's back-four at the other end. Victor Wanyama headed home from close range after Harry Kane's knock-on The hosts' best first-half chances fell to Toby Alderweireld, who headed straight at Hennessey unmarked from Erik Lamela's corner on 12 minutes, and Kane, who fired narrowly past the far post in acres of space from distance. Wanyama also threatened with a header from a corner before the break, and he would ultimately make the breakthrough for his new team, but it was Janssen who should have made it 1-0 on 69 minutes.

Chelsea came from behind to beat Watford 2-1 on Saturday. Having avoided a second booking for simulation in the second half at Vicarage Road the Spaniard took full advantage of referee Jon Moss' reprieve, following up his winner against West Ham on Monday night with the decisive goal three minutes from time. Etienne Capoue's stunning 55th-minute volley had given Watford a deserved lead until Chelsea responded through summer signing Michy Batshuayi, who scored his first Premier League goal 10 minutes from time. The result sees Antonio Conte claim his second win from his first two top-flight games, and sees the Blues move level with early leaders Manchester United. Watford, meanwhile, remain on one point from their two opening fixtures. Chris Kamara delivers his verdict on Chelsea's visit to Vicarage Road as they took on Watford. Chris Kamara delivers his verdict on Chelsea's visit to Vicarage Road as they took on Watford. Walter Mazzarri stuck with the same Watford team that - despite Ben Watson's late dismissal - ground out a 1-1 draw at Southampton on the opening day. Conte, meanwhile, replaced Willian for Pedro in what was his only change from Chelsea's last outing. Watford created the first opening as Miguel Britos' scything pass played Jose Holebas through on goal, but Thibaut Courtois was equal to the Greece international's strike on seven minutes. Diego Costa (R) celebrates scoring Chelsea's second goal The game ebbed and flowed in the opening exchanges as both sides enjoyed long spells of possession without threatening the opposition goal. That was the case until 24 minutes, when Nodrin Amrabat bundled his way down the right flank, beat Cesar Azpilicueta and drilled a low ball into the Chelsea area. Ighalo was poised to turn the ball home from six-yards, but Gary Cahill's intervention was enough to see the Nigeria international loop the ball over the target. Etienne Capoue of Watford celebrates scoring his side's first goal against Chelsea Watford continued to create the better chances as Adlene Guedioura blazed over the target on 32 minutes, seconds after John Terry had denied Ighalo was denied heading home with a perfectly-timed clearance. Costa threatened in the closing stages of the half, forcing Heurelho Gomes to spilling a cross, but the Blues couldn't capitalise as the half ended level. Watford resumed strongly and broke the deadlock within 10 minutes. A floated ball into the Chelsea area found Capoue at the far post, and the Frenchman controlled on his chest before rifling high past Courtois for his second goal in as many games. Chelsea substitute Michy Batshuayi celebrates after scoring against Watford Costa picked up a booking for gesticulating to the match officials in the aftermath of Watford's opener, and Chelsea looked lost for ideas when looking for a route back into the game. Chelsea grew frustrated chasing the game, and Costa personified this by throwing himself to ground theatrically on 67 minutes in a bid to win a free-kick. Referee Moss opted not to dismiss the Spaniard for a second bookable offence. Walter Mazzarri says if Watford continue playing how they did against Chelsea, results will come. Walter Mazzarri says if Watford continue playing how they did against Chelsea, results will come. But Conte's use of his substitutions proved to be decisive. First Victor Moses injected pace and energy into the tiring Chelsea attack, before the introduction of Batshuayi and Cesc Fabregas, overlooked for the second week running, added quality in the final third. Chelsea's Spanish striker Diego Costa celebrates after scoring the winner When an unsighted Gomes was unable to gather Eden Hazard's dipping drive, an eager Batshuayi was on hand to convert from close range for his first goal since his big-money summer move from Marseille. Seven minutes later Fabregas' inch-perfect through ball released Costa and he slotted the ball home under Gomes to complete the turnaround, which could have been made secure had Batshuayi found the net instead of rattling the underside of the Watford bar in added time.

It was a Gareth McAuley header that saw the Baggies ahead in the ninth minute, and the Toffees rounded off a disappointing first-half performance with a delightful goal from Mirallas on the stroke of half-time. But a much improved display after the break - that saw debuts for Yannick Bolasie and Ashley Williams - saw Barry head home his first goal since January 2014 to seal a first win of the season for Ronald Koeman. Both sides are in EFL Cup action on Tuesday, but return to Premier League business at the weekend as Everton host Stoke before West Brom host Middlesbrough on Sunday live on Sky Sports 1. West Brom came racing out of the traps in their first home game of the 2016/17 season, and Salomon Rondon nearly grabbed his third Premier League goal in three games but was denied by a near post save from Maarten Stekelenburg. But the resulting corner saw the Baggies fire in front inside 10 minutes after McAuley shook off his mark in Phil Jagielka, powering to the back post and head home from Craig Gardner's corner. Yannick Bolasie made his Everton debut on Saturday, coming on as a second-half substitute Everton were seeing the better of the ball but were doing very little with it until the 24th minute when they had their first chance of the game, with Barry playing in Leighton Baines on the right before getting himself into the box to collect his team-mate's cross but his shot could only fire into the hands of West Brom goalkeeper Ben Foster. Paul Merson shares his thoughts on the game between West Brom and Everton at the Hawthorns. Paul Merson shares his thoughts on the game between West Brom and Everton at the Hawthorns. Ronald Koeman made a rare first-half substitution and brought on Romelu Lukaku for James McCarthy in the 38th minute and he did bring some attacking bite to the game, which Everton were able to captialise on just before half-time. Gareth McAuley scored the opener for West Brom, heading home inside ten minutes It was Mirallas who set off the move, with some lovely one-touch football between Barry and Baines before the latter found the Belgian winger in the box, who fired past an out-stretched Foster to level the scores. Both goalkeepers were called into action early in the second half with Stekelenburg making a great save from Darren Fletcher's powerful striker before Foster made a near-post stop from Gerard Deulofeu after a Mirallas corner. Salomon Rondon and Gareth Barry battle for possession But Foster could do nothing about Everton's second goal on the stroke of the hour as a Mirallas corner found Holgate at the back post, with the youngster knocking it back across the area to find the head of Barry who put the ball into the back of the net. Yannick Bolasie came on for his debut just after the goal and could have nabbed an assist ten minutes later as Barkley put his sumptuous cross just wide of the post, before McAuley headed wide at the other end not long after. Kevin Mirallas celebrates scoring his equaliser just before half-time It was a fast finish at the Hawthorns as both sides looked to nab another goal, with Lukaku denied by Foster after some great work from Bolasie before the goalkeeper came up for a last-gasp free-kick for West Brom and fired just wide, much to the relief of the travelling Everton fans.

goalless draw at the King Power on Saturday evening as both sides' search for a first Premier League win of the season continues. The champions thought they should have been awarded two penalties in the game, firstly when Danny Drinkwater was upended by Laurent Koscielny just before the break. Then in the dying seconds, substitute Ahmed Musa was also bundled over by Hector Bellerin, but again referee Mark Clattenburg waved play on. Francis Coquelin attempts to control the ball while under pressure from Jamie Vardy Leicester boss Claudio Ranieri made four changes from the team that surprisingly lost 2-1 at newly promoted Hull City in their opening fixture of the season last Saturday, including handing a debut to midfielder Nampalys Mendy. The visitors, meanwhile, also made a raft of alterations having lost 4-3 at home to Liverpool on Super Sunday, with Koscielny back to partner Rob Holding at the heart of their defence. Arsene Wenger opted to hand his big-money summer purchase from Borussia Monchengladbach, Granit Xhaka, his first Premier League start, while Santi Cazorla was handed a run-out following injuries to both Aaron Ramsey and Alex Iwobi last weekend. Ahmed Musa (L) goes to ground under pressure from Hector Bellerin However, the Frenchman decided that Mesut Ozil and Olivier Giroud were only fit enough to take their places on the substitutes bench after their recent exertions for Germany and France respectively at Euro 2016. Leicester 0 - 0 Arsenal Leicester 0 - 0 Arsenal It was the Gunners, though, who enjoyed the better chances in the first period, without ever really threatening to make that crucial first breakthrough, while as expected Leicester tried to hit their opponents on the counter-attack. Ahmed Musa of Leicester City appeals for a penalty Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain - another handed a start by Wenger after impressing as a substitute against Liverpool - had Arsenal's first good opening of the contest after 25 minutes, only for his shot from the left-hand edge of the box to curl narrowly past Kasper Schmeichel's far post. Just past the half-hour mark the Denmark international was called upon to make a smart save to keep out Cazorla's devilish free kick from the left-hand touchline as the Gunners looked to make their territorial advantage count. However, it was Leicester who felt they should have gone in ahead at the break after one of many debatable decisions by Mr Clattenburg, taking charge of his first encounter of the campaign. Rob Holding was praised by Arsene Wenger following his display against Leicester Riyad Mahrez slid Jamie Vardy down the right-hand channel of the box and after Petr Cech raced out to bravely block the striker, the ball broke kindly for Drinkwater, who appeared to be felled by Koscielny. But the man in the middle correctly decided that Arsenal's captain had just got the faintest of touches on the ball. Petr Cech (L) saves a shot on goal from Riyad Mahrez There was more controversy after half-time when Clattenburg allowed Francis Coquelin to stay on the pitch, despite the Arsenal midfielder tripping Mahrez on the edge of the box when already on a yellow. By that point, Leicester had already lost their £13m summer buy from Nice, Mendy, to a knee injury that appeared to disrupt their rhythm. Cech gets the better of Vardy Cech gets the better of Vardy Arsenal - despite introducing the likes of Ozil, Jack Wilshere and Giroud for the final quarter of an hour - also struggled to create many clear-cut openings after half-time, although Theo Walcott will be disappointed not to have scored when sent through on goal with nine minutes to go. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (L) takes a shot at goal under pressure from Danny Drinkwater (R) However, Leicester captain Wes Morgan made a brilliant goal-saving tackle to preserve the hosts' clean sheet, before one final contentious moment with two minutes to go. Musa, who had given a glimpse of his blistering pace in a pre-season friendly against Barcelona, showed Bellerin a clean pair of heels on the left-hand touchline, before driving towards the box, only to be bundled over by the Spaniard. Nampalys Mendy (L) holds off Granit Xhaka (R) The man that mattered most, though, again ruled in Arsenal's favour, while Cech's late stop from Mahrez in what was Leicester' first shot on target in the game meant the Foxes have now gone 20 Premier League matches without a win against the Gunners.

"Highlights of Manchester United's 2-0 win over Southampton Highlights of Manchester United's 2-0 win over Southampton Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored twice as Manchester United cruised to a 2-0 victory over Southampton at Old Trafford on Friday night. Paul Pogba started for the first time on his return to United, this time as the world's most expensive footballer, but it was Ibrahimovic who stole the limelight as he made it three Premier League goals in two games for United. The Swede opened the scoring after 36 minutes, and added a second after the break from the penalty spot to secure a second straight win for Jose Mourinho's side, who were already top of the table heading into the match. Zlatan Ibrahimovic celebrates his opening goal against Southampton There was plenty of excitement around Old Trafford as Pogba was named in the starting line-up by Mourinho, but his first touch of the ball looked a far cry from one belonging to the world's most expensive player. Less than a minute after kick-off, the Frenchman completely miscontrolled a simple pass into feet which allowed Southampton to launch a counter-attack. Luckily for him, the Saints failed to capitalise. Pogba quickly caught up with the pace of the game, though, and forced a decent stop from Fraser Forster after 13 minutes, picking up the ball in the Southampton area before seeing his curling effort kept out by the goalkeeper. Paul Pogba directs a header towards goal Southampton were more than happy to allow United possession as they threatened on the counter-attack, with Nathan Redmond looking particularly lively in the early stages, but they lacked a cutting edge and never truly threatened David de Gea's goal. United then switched up the gears as the half wore on, and the first incisive moment brought the first goal of the season at Old Trafford. Wayne Rooney, given far too much space on the right, looked up before whipping a pinpoint cross into the path of Ibrahimovic at the far post, who rose highest above Jose Fonte to power a header past Forster. Ibrahimovic (right) scores United's second goal from the penalty spot United have never lost a Premier League game at Old Trafford when leading at half-time, and Southampton's chances of ending that run became even more unlikely seven minutes after the break. Jordy Clasie, on for the injured Oriol Romeu in the first half, needlessly brought down Luke Shaw in the penalty area, and Ibrahimovic stepped up to slot the ball into the bottom corner. The rest of the match was largely a formality for United, but Pogba missed a glorious chance after 64 minutes to open his account and completely kill the game as a contest. Jose Mourinho shouts instructions from the touchline The Frenchman beat his marker in the air to get on the end of Juan Mata's corner, but he could only head the ball over when he should at least have hit the target. Pogba then had another chance late on as United countered in stoppage time, but he could only fire wide from Henrikh Mkhitaryan's pass after being teed up on the edge of the area.

"Highlights from Stamford Bridge as Diego Costa's late goal gave Chelsea a 2 - 1 win over West Ham. Highlights from Stamford Bridge as Diego Costa's late goal gave Chelsea a 2 - 1 win over West Ham. Diego Costa's late goal earned Antonio Conte's Chelsea a 2-1 win over West Ham at Stamford Bridge on Monday. The Blues were largely dominant and took the lead shortly after half-time through Eden Hazard's penalty. The introduction of Dimitri Payet looked to have helped the Hammers, who lost record signing Andre Ayew to injury in the first half, snatch a point as his corner was turned in by James Collins in the 77th minute. However, Costa finished from outside the box in the 89th minute to give the hosts a victory that, on the balance of play, was deserved. Eden Hazard scored the opening goal of the match While West Ham handed competitive debuts to three players - Arthur Masuaku, Ayew and Havard Nordtveit - the hosts had 10 players in their XI who started the opening game last season. The only one to miss out in Conte's first competitive match in charge was Cesc Fabregas, who made way for summer signing N'Golo Kante. The former Leicester midfielder did not take long to make his mark, receiving a yellow card after less than three minutes for bringing down Andy Carroll. But, after a tentative opening 10 minutes, Chelsea settled into the game and started to dominate possession. Branislav Ivanovic forced Adrian into a sharp low save at his near post before Oscar was denied a penalty when he went down under a challenge from Winston Reid, who stuck out an arm as the Brazilian knocked the ball past him into the box. Hazard, who enjoyed a bright first half, then shot narrowly wide after driving down the left flank. West Ham lost record signing Ayew to injury after 35 minutes, with another summer addition, Gokhan Tore, coming on in his place. Chelsea continued to control the game as Costa shot over and Willian saw a free-kick saved before the end of the half. The hosts got the breakthrough shortly after the restart as Michail Antonio fouled Cesar Azpilicueta in the box and Hazard fired the penalty into the roof of the net. Conte says he was extremely proud of the intensity and spirit Chelsea showed Conte says he was extremely proud of the intensity and spirit Chelsea showed Antonio was replaced by Sam Byram a few minutes later but chances continued to come for Chelsea. Adrian saved from Willian before John Terry headed over the bar from a corner. Bilic admits Chelsea were the better side Bilic admits Chelsea were the better side Slaven Bilic opted to introduce Payet after 67 minutes and it was from his corner that Collins fired home the equaliser.

It was virtually the perfect start for Jose Mourinho on his return to the English top flight, as his side secured the Portuguese his first Premier League success as United boss. Reaction from Ibrahimovic and Rooney Reaction from Ibrahimovic and Rooney Juan Mata set United on their way after 40 minutes, Wayne Rooney headed a second just before the hour mark and Ibrahimovic got himself up and running five minutes later. Adam Smith then pulled one back in emphatic fashion with just over 20 minutes to go, but it was too little too late for Bournemouth. Juan Mata scored the opener for United Mata may have suffered the indignity of being substituted as a substitute during United's Community Shield win over Leicester last week, but he was surprisingly named in the starting line-up as Mourinho made two changes from the win over Leicester, with Jesse Lingard and Michael Carrick dropping out. Ander Herrera also came in. And Mata was right at the heart of United's first chance of the match after 27 minutes, as he teed up Rooney on the edge of the area, only for the captain to fire his effort straight at Bournemouth goalkeeper Artur Boruc. Zlatan Ibrahimovic was a little surprised by the man of the match choice Zlatan Ibrahimovic was a little surprised by the man of the match choice The home side looked comfortable in defence for most of the first half as United struggled to create any clear-cut chances, but a nightmare moment from captain Simon Francis gifted Mata the opener. First, Francis sold Boruc woefully short with an attempted back-pass to allow Mata in, before the Bournemouth defender then inadvertently pushed the ball back towards his own goal after Boruc had saved well at Mata's feet, allowing the Spaniard to stroke the ball into an empty net from close range. Alan Smith brings you his round-up from all the action Alan Smith brings you his round-up from all the action Boosted by their opener, United and Ibrahimovic livened up after the break, and the Swede nearly set Rooney on his way to United's second with an exquisite back-heel after 51 minutes, but Boruc was off his line well to deny the striker. Moments later Rooney wanted a penalty after linking up with Ibrahimovic again, but referee Andre Marriner waved any protests away after he had gone down in the box under a very soft challenge from Andrew Surman. Mata slotted home in the first half On the stroke of the hour mark, though, Rooney was on hand to double United's lead. Anthony Martial's scuffed shot found him unmarked in the area, and the captain did just about enough to place his header past Boruc. And after 64 minutes it was Ibrahimovic's chance to announce himself in the Premier League, picking up the ball 25 yards from goal before drilling a superb low effort into the bottom corner to make it 3-0. Lewis Cook takes on Luke Shaw (left) and Marouane Fellaini Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe responded with a quick double change, and one of those substitutions Lewis Grabban had an immediate impact as he teed up Smith after 69 minutes, who did superbly to cut inside and hammer one past David de Gea. There would be no late rally from the Cherries, though, as Manchester United cruised through to a victory that left them top of the Premier League table.

Arsene Wenger's side started brightly and they were rewarded in the 29th minute with a penalty after Alberto Moreno brought down Theo Walcott, but the England international saw his spot-kick saved. Highlights from Emirates Stadium as Arsenal faced Liverpool in their opening match of the season Highlights from Emirates Stadium as Arsenal faced Liverpool in their opening match of the season He made amends just 68 seconds later, drilling a low effort into the far corner to hand the hosts the lead, but Philippe Coutinho's superb free-kick levelled proceedings in first-half stoppage time, before goals from Adam Lallana (49), another from Coutinho (59) and a stunning solo effort from Sadio Mane (63) turned the match on its head. Arsenal responded a minute later through substitute Alex-Oxlade Chamberlain before Calum Chambers' header cut the deficit once more with 15 minutes remaining, but it was Jurgen Klopp's side who held on to secure a deserved victory on a breathless afternoon in north London. Jamie Redknapp brings you his round-up of all the action at the Emirates Stadium Jamie Redknapp brings you his round-up of all the action at the Emirates Stadium With Per Mertesacker, Laurent Koscielny and Gabriel all absent, Wenger handed summer signing Rob Holding his Premier League debut alongside Chambers at the heart of Arsenal's defence and the inexperienced duo were hardly tested in the opening stages as Arsenal dominated the ball. Alexis Sanchez, starting in attack in the absence of Olivier Giroud, was involved early, flicking the ball off for Aaron Ramsey in the box but the Wales international could only poke his shot straight at Simon Mignolet. Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp admits he was blown away by the intensity of their win over Arsenal Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp admits he was blown away by the intensity of their win over Arsenal Ramsey, playing in the more advanced role he performed so well in for Wales during Euro 2016, was becoming more and more influential, latching onto Alberto Moreno's poor headed clearance but the Spanish full-back recovered with a sliding tackle. Moreno was in the thick of the action again in the 29th minute but this time he was punished for another rash tackle, lunging in and catching Walcott just inside the penalty area. Sadio Mane celebrates with manager Jurgen Klopp after scoring Liverpool's fourth goal It left referee Michael Oliver with no choice but to point to the spot. Up stepped Walcott, but Mignolet, diving to his right, palmed the ball away to safety to keep the scores level. Just over a minute later, though, the Gunners were in front and it was a moment of redemption for Walcott, who made amends for his penalty miss, drilling a low right-footed shot into the far corner after being picked out by Alex Iwobi. Mane scores Liverpool's fourth goal in style It was no more than Wenger's men deserved for their dominance but the scores should have been level when Georginio Wijnaldum latched onto Coutinho's cut back, only to pick out Petr Cech with a rather tame effort. They were level though in injury time at the end of the first half and it was a moment of magic from Coutinho, who curled a free-kick from 30 yards over the wall and into the top corner. Theo Walcott missed from the penalty spot The turnaround was complete immediately after the break when Lallana brought down Wijnaldum's cross before firing a low finish past Cech and into the net. Whatever Klopp said to his players at the break seemed to work and they extended their advantage in the 56th minute with Coutinho converting Nathaniel Clyne's low cross. Reaction from Adam Lallana and man of the match Philippe Coutinho Reaction from Adam Lallana and man of the match Philippe Coutinho Arsenal responded by bringing on Oxlade-Chamberlain in place of the injured Iwobi and Santi Cazorla for Ramsey, who also appeared to pick up a knock, but Liverpool continued to pile forward with pace. And it was four in the 63rd minute as Mane outran Chambers before cutting inside and brilliantly picking out the top corner with a left-foot shot. Adam Lallana finished neatly for Liverpool's second The action wasn't finished there as Oxlade-Chamberlain's deflected shot sneaked past Mignolet , before the hosts cut the deficit again as Chambers glanced Cazorla's free-kick past the dive and Mignolet into the far corner to breathe life into the comeback with 15 minutes remaining.

The Tigers opened the scoring in first-half stoppage time thanks to Adama Diomande's spectacular overhead kick, only for Riyad Mahrez to equalise from the penalty spot at the start of the second period. However, the Tigers recorded a memorable opening-day victory when Robert Snodgrass scored with a well-struck shot from the edge of the box just before the hour-mark. Hull boss Mike Phelan opted to field midfielder Jake Livermore as a makeshift centre-back for his first competitive game in charge of the club. Tony Cottee recaps Hull's opening day victory over defending champions Leicester. Tony Cottee recaps Hull's opening day victory over defending champions Leicester. Meanwhile, the champions gave record signing Ahmed Musa his Premier League debut, although fellow new boy Nampalys Mendy was absent after his wife went into labour overnight. Claudio Ranieri also opted to field another summer acquisition, Luis Hernandez, to partner Wes Morgan at the heart of the visitors' back four, with Robert Huth still serving the final game of a three-match suspension. It was the newly promoted Premier League team, though, who made the more assured start, with Hull's players passing the ball around nicely in the opening exchanges, clearly not distracted by their own fans' protests against the owners. Claudio Ranieri felt Leicester lost because they failed to take their chances early on Claudio Ranieri felt Leicester lost because they failed to take their chances early on Captain Curtis Davies had the first good chance of the contest after just six minutes, but the central defender's header from Snodgrass's left-wing corner curled just past Kasper Schmeichel's far post. However, as the first half wore on, Leicester gradually grew into the encounter and had several opportunities to open the scoring, only to spurn them all. Three minutes before half-time, Christian Fuchs played a neat one-two on the edge of the box, but his close-range shot was blocked, before Livermore also made a vital goal-saving challenge to deny Jamie Vardy. Robert Snodgrass felt Hull's character and togetherness helped them cause a shock on the opening day Robert Snodgrass felt Hull's character and togetherness helped them cause a shock on the opening day From the rebound, Mahrez made himself some space in the area, only to curl his effort wide of the target, while Vardy then blazed horribly over the bar minutes later after being set up by strike partner Musa. That miss was to prove costly, though, when Hull went up the other end of the pitch and took the lead following Snodgrass's left-wing corner. Davies again rose high at the near post to force a brilliant reaction save by Schmeichel, but luckily for Hull, Diomande - with Abel Hernandez in close proximity - was there to find the back of the net with a sensational bicycle kick. Hull celebrate Adama Diomande's opener in first-half stoppage time If Hull were lifted by that strike, the wind was soon taken out of their sails just 14 seconds into the second half after Tom Huddlestone was harshly adjudged to have tripped Demarai Gray just inside the box by referee Mike Dean. Mahrez kept his cool from the spot by placing the ball straight down the middle as Hull goalkeeper Eldin Jakupovic dived the wrong way, but Leicester were only on level terms for 10 minutes. Schmeichel tried to launch a counter-attack with a quick throw to the halfway line, only for Hull to intercept and drive forward down the right, with Ahmed Elmohamady delivering a wicked ball into the six-yard box that Danny Simpson, under pressure, could only clear to the edge of the area. Wes Morgan admitted he and his Leicester team-mates were second best Wes Morgan admitted he and his Leicester team-mates were second best Waiting there was man-of-the-match Snodgrass, who kept his eye on the ball before striking a sweet low shot into the bottom corner of the net to send the home fans into delirium. Thereafter, Hull managed to hang on with relatively ease to inflict a first league defeat on Leicester since going down 2-1 at Arsenal on February 14, while the Foxes also became the first champions to lose on the opening day of the season since Arsenal in August 1989.

The Venezuelan rose highest to flick in substitute James McClean's corner on 74 minutes and the visitors held on to start the new season with victory. There was a late penalty shout from Yannick Bolasie, who had started the game on the bench following Palace's acceptance of a £30m bid from Everton, and new signing Andros Townsend fired an injury-time free-kick wide as the hosts pushed for an equaliser. But in a game of few chances it was West Brom and Rondon - who had been denied by a superb Wayne Hennessey save in the first-half - who came out on top. Saido Berahino (L) vies with Palace defender Joel Ward After seeing his seventh-minute header clawed away by Palace's Wales international goalkeeper, Rondon then turned provider, bringing down a Fletcher long ball before clipping a cross to his strike partner Saido Berahino - in the starting XI despite Palace and Stoke making bids to sign him - but the 23-year-old nodded tamely wide. At the other end, Connor Wickham should have done better than drag Mile Jedinak's low cross wide on 19 minutes before Townsend scuffed a low drive from 30 yards harmlessly at Ben Foster after cutting in from the right. Tony Pulis was pleased with West Brom's defence and warned Saido Berahino will not be departing without a like-for-like replacement Tony Pulis was pleased with West Brom's defence and warned Saido Berahino will not be departing without a like-for-like replacement Townsend, Palace's £13m summer buy from Newcastle, then saw a shot blocked from close range just after the half-hour mark after picking up Jonas Olsson's headed clearance. Five minutes after the re-start, Wilfried Zaha spurned a golden chance to open the scoring, shooting straight at Foster when through one-on-one. The former England 'keeper was then up sharply to save Zaha's second attempt. Wilfried Zaha has his attempt on goal saved by Ben Foster A wild Wickham free-kick and blocked Jason Puncheon effort followed as Palace grew into the game but at the back there were problems, with a Craig Gardner corner leading to a goal-mouth scramble before Claudio Yacob fired over the bar. And it was from another cross from out wide that Palace were punished. Townsend fouled Craig Dawson in the right channel and sub McClean's whipped cross was nodded in by Rondon.

Barkley free-kick to earn Tottenham a 1-1 draw at Everton in their opening Premier League game of the season. The hosts, under new manager Ronald Koeman, bossed the first half and took an early lead when Barkley's set-piece missed every team-mate but ended up in the far corner of Hugo Lloris' net. Spurs lost Lloris to injury and needed replacement Michel Vorm to stop Everton going further ahead before Mauricio Pochettino introduced summer signing Vincent Janssen on 55 minutes and changed the course of the game. The visitors drew level when Lamela glanced home a header from Kyle Walker's cross on the hour-mark and Janssen might have bagged the winner late on but was denied by Maarten Stekelenburg. Matt Le Tissier brings you his round-up of the draw between Tottenham and Everton Matt Le Tissier brings you his round-up of the draw between Tottenham and Everton The Dutch goalkeeper was one of two players making their Everton debuts along with midfielder Idrissa Gueye, and both enjoyed excellent opening displays in front of their supporters. With striker Romelu Lukaku missing through injury, Koeman played a back-three that stifled Spurs in attack and allowed Gerard Deulofeu to be the focal point up front, and he was brought down on the edge of the box to set up their opener on five minutes. Ross Barkley's free-kick found its way into the far corner on five minutes to give Everton the lead Barkley's curling delivery was aimed for the head of Phil Jagielka but it beat everyone including Lloris, who appeared to take a knock as he crumpled in the far corner of the goal, along with the ball. Pochettino's well-drilled players responded well and Eriksen and their own debutant Victor Wanyama had long-range shots blocked, but both had to concentrate more on defending as Deulofeu caused problems. Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino said Everton made it difficult for his side to take advantage of their second half possession Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino said Everton made it difficult for his side to take advantage of their second half possession The Spaniard forced Lloris to save again before the Frenchman was forced off on 35 minutes and substitute Vorm had to get low with his legs to deny Deulofeu twice either side of half-time. Spurs' introduction of Janssen for Eric Dier and a switch to 4-4-2 forced Everton to defend deeper and it was the away side's game to win after Lamela stole in front of his marker to nod in the equaliser on 59 minutes. Midfielder Victor Wanyama had an excellent game on his Tottenham debut Everton remained a threat on the break but half-chances for Kevin Mirallas and Ramiro Funes Mori were all they could muster before a glorious chance fell to Janssen to score the winner on his Premier League debut. The hosts failed to clear a corner and it dropped to the Netherlands striker, but his close-range shot found the big palm of Stekelenburg before the ball was successfully hacked away from danger. Everton manager Ronald Koeman said both sides had a chance to win the game but he felt a draw was a fair result in the end Everton manager Ronald Koeman said both sides had a chance to win the game but he felt a draw was a fair result in the end Stekelenburg - a summer signing from Fulham who played under Koeman on loan at Southampton last season - also denied Lamela late on after his cross was deflected towards the top corner.

After a seven-year absence from the top flight, Aitor Karanka's side made the perfect start with new signing Alvaro Negredo heading home from close range in the 11th minute. The hosts went close to doubling their advantage just before the break when Gaston Ramirez's shot rebounded off the post, but it was Stoke who hit back in the second half through Shaqiri. The Switzerland international wrong-footed Victor Valdes with a superb free-kick in the 67th minute to peg Boro back and seal an opening day point for Mark Hughes' side. Karanka handed Premier League debuts to four of his summer signings with Valdes, Antonio Barragan and Marten De Roon joining Negredo in Middlesbrough's starting line-up. Mark Hughes praised Xherdan Shaqiri after his free-kick secured Stoke a point at Middlesbrough Mark Hughes praised Xherdan Shaqiri after his free-kick secured Stoke a point at Middlesbrough And it did not take long for one of new boys to make an impact with Negredo heading home after Ramirez nodded Albert Adomah's cross back across goal. It was not such good news for De Roon, who was replaced by Adam Forshaw in the 19th minute after picking up an injury, but Boro continued to boss proceedings against Hughes' side. Negredo heads Boro in front The visitors, who left new signing Joe Allen on the bench, finally created an opening on the half-hour mark when Marko Arnautovic glanced a header goalwards, but Valdes was in position to make a comfortable save. Boro continued to threaten as Ramirez, who moved to the Riverside on a permanent deal following a successful loan spell last season, ghosted past Ryan Shawcross before firing a low left-footed shot against the post. Aitor Karanka says he wants Alvaro Negredo to recover his confidence and become a very important part of the Middlesbrough team Aitor Karanka says he wants Alvaro Negredo to recover his confidence and become a very important part of the Middlesbrough team Ramirez was then needed at the other end, heading off the line from Shaqiri's corner before the Switzerland international fired wide after Arnautovic's pass deflected into his path. Stoke continued to struggle in front of goal in the second-half with Arnautovic volleying well wide after bursting onto Erik Pieters' 58th-minute throw-in. And the home side should probably have extended their lead on the hour when Adomah burst clear down the right but could only pick out Stoke defender Phil Bardsley, with Negredo and Stewart Downing in the penalty area. Arnautovic continued to threaten, but struck the corner flag with a wild 64th-minute effort. Aitor Karanka celebrates Alvaro Negredo's opener However, Shaqiri finally made an impact with 23 minutes remaining when he curled a fine free-kick over the wall and into the bottom corner past the dive of Valdes.

McNair's own goal three minutes from time handed Pep Guardiola's Manchester City a 2-1 win over Sunderland in his first game as head coach. McNair, who had only been on the pitch for four minutes on his Sunderland debut having signed from Manchester United, nodded into the corner of his own net after Jesus Navas' cross. Earlier, Guardiola's Premier League debut got off to the perfect start after four minutes as Sergio Aguero converted from the spot after Patrick van Aanholt had brought down Raheem Sterling. City had most of the ball in both halves, but Sunderland equalised with 19 minutes remaining through Jermain Defoe's tidy low finish inside the area, before the late own goal broke Sunderland's hearts. Guardiola's City now face a tricky Champions League play-off round first leg at Steaua Bucharest on Wednesday, while David Moyes' Sunderland host north-east rivals Middlesbrough next Sunday, live on Sky Sports. Guardiola's first selection decision was a controversial one, leaving England No 1 Joe Hart on the bench, and his replacement Willy Caballero was called into action early, beating away Van Aanholt's 25-yard free-kick. Willy Caballero came in for City as Joe Hart was left on the bench John Stones made his City debut alongside England team-mate Sterling, and it was the latter's fine work that helped City take the lead. Collecting the ball on the gallop, Sterling turned swiftly inside the area, forcing Van Aanholt to clip his leg. Aguero, City's top scorer last season, made no mistake from the spot, powering the penalty past Vito Mannone. Spaniard Nolito, another debutant, went close later in the half, curling just wide from the left having cut inside, but despite City's dominance in possession, Sunderland had the best chance of the remainder of the half. Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero celebrates the opening goal Having got on the end of Lamine Kone's header into the box, Defoe's poke goalwards was saved well by Caballero at point-blank range. Aguero should have doubled his and City's tally on the hour mark, pulling an effort wide from 10 yards after the ball dropped kindly to him, and the hosts were made to pay 10 minutes later. As Stones raced out to close Jack Rodwell down, the midfielder fed Defoe in a central position, leaving him to coolly slot the ball under Caballero. Sunderland's Jermain Defoe celebrates the equalising goal The goal makes Defoe the eighth player to score in 16 or more Premier League seasons, and puts him joint-10th in the all-time Premier League scoring charts with 144 goals. Sunderland briefly pushed for a second, but it was City who grabbed the late winner. After Navas had got down the right and fed the ball into the six-yard box, the ball flicked off Mannone's hand and onto the head of his team-mate McNair, who could not prevent the ball bouncing off his head and into the back of the net. Pep Guardiola gestures during his first competitive match as City head coach Kelechi Iheanacho came close to making the game safe with a minute remaining, seeing his effort from 12 yards deflect off Mannone and over. Despite late Sunderland pressure, City held on for the three points, something last season's title rivals Leicester and Tottenham failed to achieve on the opening day of the Premier League.
