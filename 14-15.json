Making his first start for the Gunners since February, Walcott made up for lost time by firing his side into the lead after just four minutes with a powerful strike into the top corner. He grabbed his second in the 14th minute, before Jack Wilshere extended Arsene Wenger's side's lead with a stunning half-volley from 20 yards. Arsene Wenger says his side has progressed this season and was delighted with Theo Walcott Arsene Wenger says his side has progressed this season and was delighted with Theo Walcott Walcott staked his claim for a starting spot in the cup final by completing his third career hat-trick in the 37th minute to make it 4-0 and put the result beyond any doubt. Gareth McAuley pulled a goal back for the visitors after the break but it was only a consolation as Arsenal, who will attempt to win a record 12th FA Cup against Aston Villa at Wembley next Saturday, wrapped up third position in the Premier League and a direct route into next season's Champions League group stage. It took Walcott, who was making just his fourth start of the season, just four minutes to open the scoring, as Santi Cazorla picked him out just inside the area, before the England man rifled his shot across Boaz Myhill and into the top corner. Walcott was enjoying life as a central striker and, in the 14th minute, he pounced on excellent work from Wilshere and Mesut Ozil to lift the ball over the challenge of Jonas Olsson and toe-poke the ball past Myhill. Theo Walcott says he's been patient whilst being out with an injury this season and was delighted to grab hat-trick Theo Walcott says he's been patient whilst being out with an injury this season and was delighted to grab hat-trick Minutes later it was Wilshere’s turn to get on the scoresheet on his 100th Premier League appearance for the Gunners and he won’t score many better. West Brom failed to clear an Arsenal corner and the ball fell into the path of Wilshere, who thumped a half-volley into the top corner from 20 yards. Arsenal were rampant against a West Brom side with nothing to play for. Alexis Sanchez picked out Walcott, who tried to bend the ball into the far corner, but he was denied his hat-trick by Myhill. The England star was not to be denied for long, though, and it was Wilshere at the heart of things for the home side. He drove into the penalty area before flicking the ball to Sanchez, whose shot trickled across goal for Walcott to tap home. It was a case of damage limitation for Tony Pulis’ side in the second half and they put in a much better showing, with substitute Victor Anichebe leading the line. And they grabbed a goal back in the 57th minute, as McAuley rose above David Ospina to head Chris Brunt’s corner into the back of the net. West Brom were making a much better fist of things and were threatening the Arsenal goal much more as Saido Berahino slipped in James Morrison, but he dragged his shot wide of the target. Aaron Ramsey looks back over the season and talks about what Arsenal need to do next year Aaron Ramsey looks back over the season and talks about what Arsenal need to do next year With the game all but wrapped up, Wenger, who has now won all six of his Premier League games as a manager against Pulis at the Emirates, turned his attention to next week's cup final and started to ring the changes, with Francis Coquelin and Walcot being replaced by Aaron Ramsey and Olivier Giroud. Wilshere also made way with 15 minutes remaining and there was a return to action for Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, who was making his first appearance since the start of March. It was Ramsey who looked lively from the bench and he hit the post and the bar within minutes of each other as the Gunners looked for a fifth. However, it was the visitors who nearly rounded off the scoring in the 90th minute, when substitute Craig Gardner’s shot burst through the hands of Ospina but, luckily for the Colombian keeper, the ball flicked up and on to the cross bar.

The striker headed the only goal of the game in the sixth minute to ensure Sean Dyche’s men a victory in their last Premier League game before returning to the Championship. Villa, meanwhile, must regroup as they prepare for an FA Cup final clash with Arsenal next weekend after looking short of ideas for much of the game. Neither side had really got going as Ings leap to head Burnley in front in the sixth minute. Kieran Trippier’s cross from the right was headed out by Leandro Bacuna, Fredrik Ulvestad headed it back into the box, Ashley Barnes nodded it across and Ings powered it beyond Jed Steer in the Villa goal. Villa pushed to find an equaliser but struggled to create any chances of note and it was Burnley who should have doubled their lead midway through the half. Tim Sherwood says his players now need to concentrate on the FA Cup final, in what he calls the 'biggest game of the players’ lives' Tim Sherwood says his players now need to concentrate on the FA Cup final, in what he calls the 'biggest game of the players’ lives' George Boyd had the freedom of the right flank and having finally been confronted by Nathan Baker, twisted and turned the centre-back before clipping in a cross. Ings met it on the volley but was unable to control it as the ball sailed high and wide of the target. Tim Sherwood’s men slowly gained the upper hand as the half wore on, despite some impressive pressing from the away side, and Christian Benteke twice went close to drawing them level. First, controlling a Bacuna cross on his chest before swivelling to volley goalwards with a slight deflection taking the ball past the post before forcing Tom Heaton into action with a firm header shortly afterwards. Heaton had to be alert right at the end of the first half to tip Ashley Westwood’s acrobatic effort over the bar. The hosts then flew out of the traps at the start of the second half, exploiting any space in the middle of the park and breaking with speed through Fabian Delph, Tom Cleverley and Gabby Agbonlahor in particular. However, they were still unable to fashion any really clear cut opportunities and Heaton kept them at bay on the occasions when they were able to threaten the Burnley goal. As the clocked ticked towards 90 minutes Delph and Charles N'Zogbia stung the palms of the Burnley stopper before the former shot inches wide with Heaton unsighted and helpless. The visitors had chances on the break with the best of them falling to Boyd after clever work from Ings. Steer got down well to block the shot though and despite Villa continue to push forward, Burnley held on the end the season with a win.

Diego Costa, a first-half substitute for Drogba, scored from the spot to cancel out Steven Fletcher’s opener before Loic Remy came off the bench to score twice in the last 20 minutes of the match. Chelsea captain John Terry lifts the Premier League trophy in front of the home fans Chelsea captain John Terry lifts the Premier League trophy in front of the home fans With Sunderland having secured their Premier League status in midweek at Arsenal and Chelsea having long since wrapped up the title, there was a jovial mood at Stamford Bridge on the day they lifted the trophy. For Drogba, in particular, it was an emotional exit having announced that this would be his final appearance for the club and he was given the full treatment by the Chelsea faithful. The Ivorian was made captain for the day before being substituted after just half an hour with his team-mates chairlifting him off the field to a huge ovation from Roman Abramovich among others. Jose Mourinho was rather more reserved given that Chelsea were already a goal down at that point with Fletcher having headed home unmarked from Adam Johnson’s corner. After picking up the Premier League trophy, Jose Mourinho says he will have to add to his squad After picking up the Premier League trophy, Jose Mourinho says he will have to add to his squad The scenes that greeted Drogba’s withdrawal might have suggested that Chelsea minds were elsewhere but they were soon level through his replacement Costa. John O’Shea was adjudged to have fouled Juan Cuadrado and Costa stepped up to take the resultant spot-kick, beating Vito Mannone from 12 yards for his 20th Premier League goal of the season. Sunderland won at Stamford Bridge last season and they remain the only team to have beaten Mourinho’s Chelsea on their own turf in the Premier League. The visitors certainly had their moments on Sunday too with Petr Cech, another who could be set to leave Chelsea in the summer, being forced into smart saves from Seb Larsson and Jermain Defoe. Didier Drogba said it was almost as good a finish to his Chelsea career as when he won the Champions League Didier Drogba said it was almost as good a finish to his Chelsea career as when he won the Champions League Chelsea played some entertaining football after the break as they probed for a winner but Sunderland remained a threat at the other end with the champions uncharacteristically open. When the impressive Patrick van Aanholt found space once more on the left flank, Cech could only parry his cross into the path of Defoe and his shot was cleared near the line by Cesar Azpilicueta. Sunderland, who finish 16th, were punished soon afterwards when Eden Hazard fed Remy in a central position and the French forward fired in a low shot that Vito Mannone could only palm into the net. Mannone did rather better to keep Sunderland in the game and deny Willian when the Chelsea man headed low towards the near corner. John Terry says honesty from Jose Mourinho has kept him on his toes all season John Terry says honesty from Jose Mourinho has kept him on his toes all season But he could do nothing to prevent Remy having the final say with a neat near-post finish from Nemanja Matic’s low left-wing cross bringing his seventh of the season and second of the afternoon. The final whistle followed soon after with John Terry leading the celebrations on the day he became the first man since Gary Pallister to play every minute of a Premier League title-winning campaign. The victory also means Chelsea finish the season on 87 points – their best total since their last Premier League title victory under Mourinho in 2006 – and an eight-point lead over Manchester City in second spot.

A rare Marouane Chamakh goal secured Crystal Palace a top-half finish as they beat Swansea City 1-0 on the final day of the season. Chamakh scored his first league goal since January just before the hour mark to settle a game that was lacking in chances for long periods. The 1-0 victory was the 10th win of Alan Pardew's 18 Premier League games as Palace boss and it brought down the curtain on a superb six months for the former Newcastle manager. Pardew arrived at Selhurst Park in January with the Eagles stuck in the relegation zone but 18 matches later they have finished 10th - two places behind today's opponents - setting a club record for the Premier League. The home side had the majority of the possession and chances in the first 45 minutes, but there was a distinct lack of killer instinct from both sides in front of goal. Alan Pardew says a top 10 finish was beyond his wildest dreams when he first took the Crystal Palace job Alan Pardew says a top 10 finish was beyond his wildest dreams when he first took the Crystal Palace job Swansea nearly took the lead in the 17th minute when Leon Britton's cross came off Scott Dann but Brede Hangeland was there to head it out for a corner. Jefferson Montero took the resulting corner, but Jack Cork's near-post header was saved by Wayne Hennessey. Birthday boy Yannick Bolasie had a shot on target in the 20th minute after he cut into the box past Kyle Naughton, but he didn’t beat the goalkeeper and the reliable Lukasz Fabianski parried the ball out. Glen Murray came on for James McArthur five minutes later, as Pardew looked to add some more attacking talent to his team. Bolasie had another shot 25 yards from goal but Fernandez was there to get a head to it, diverting it over the bar to safety. Swansea had the first real chance of the second half when Marvin Emnes took a shot from outside the box but Hennessey was alert and managed to collect it. Jason Puncheon created the goal. His long cross into the box was knocked across goal by Scott Dann and Chamakh was there to tap it home. Bafetimbi Gomis should have done better, but he allowed the Moroccan international to push him as they jostled for the ball. It wasn’t the prettiest of goals but it lifted Palace two places into 10th, their highest finish in the Premier League. Unfortunately for the scorer, he was soon off the pitch as he pulled a hamstring as he bore down on goal. Garry Monk was disappointed to end the season with a defeat against Crystal Palace but was delighted with his side’s efforts Garry Monk was disappointed to end the season with a defeat against Crystal Palace but was delighted with his side’s efforts Zaha nearly doubled the home side’s lead 20 minutes from time as he ran at Naughton from the left wing, before cutting in and taking a shot that scraped the side-netting. Neither side created much as the clock ran down but it was good to see Monk give a Premier League debut to Kenji Gorre, one of the stars of their Academy and another appearance for Modou Barrow.

Mauricio Pochettino’s side entered the game knowing victory would secure European football at White Hart Lane for another season, and Kane’s 24th-minute header proved to be the difference against an at times below-par Toffees outfit. Harry Kane was happy with the win away at Everton, and says it’s been a good season Harry Kane was happy with the win away at Everton, and says it’s been a good season Kevin Mirallas wasted a string of fine chances for the hosts in both halves, but those were few and far between in an indifferent display from the Toffees which saw them booed off at half time. The result sees Everton miss out on a top-half finish after Crystal Palace’s victory against Swansea saw the Eagles leapfrog them into tenth position, Spurs finish fifth, six points off Champions League qualification. Roberto Martinez handed a home debut to teenage left-back Brendan Galloway, while outgoing centre-back Sylvain Distin was included among the substitutes ahead of his farewell. Retiring goalkeeper Brad Friedel missed out with a shin injury as Spurs packed midfield from the outset and dominated the game early exchanges, After Ryan Mason had a claim for a penalty by waved away on nine minutes, the game’s first opening fell to Erik Lamela. Romelu Lukaku looks to run away from compatriot Jan Vertonghen After pouncing on an error by debutante Galloway, the Argentine collected Christian Eriksen’s looped pass before forcing Tim Howard to a point-blank save to keep the game goalless. Mirallas then had the chance to open the scoring moments later but his poor effort failed to make the most of the opening, and Hugo Lloris was called into a rudimentary save. The Belgian was involved shortly afterwards as he juggled the ball on the edge of the Spurs area before volleying narrowly wide of the angle of post and bar, and the miss would prove costly as the visitors opened the scoring shortly after. Eric Dier’s perfectly weighted first-time cross fell was met by Kane who, after evading both Phil Jagielka and John Stones, glanced a header past Howard. After an ineffective first half, Ross Barkley was withdrawn at the interval and the introduction of Muhamed Besic, allied with a change in formation, initially rejuvenated Everton in the second period. Roberto Martinez was pleased with the second half of his side’s season but says they need to make three or four additions Roberto Martinez was pleased with the second half of his side’s season but says they need to make three or four additions Besic’s long-range strike missed the target by a yard two minutes into the second half, while young Galloway was thwarted by Lloris’ desperate lunge inside the area following a promising run from deep. Despite this, once Spurs had adjusted their formation in keeping with Everton’s change their lead rarely came under threat and they could have doubled their lead had Federico Fazio steered a free header goal wards on 64 minutes. Distin received a raucous reception as he was brought on for the final five minutes, but his inclusion did little to revive Everton’s chances as Spurs held on for a deserved victory on Merseyside.

With safety already assured after a remarkable run of form to end the season, the home fans were in raucous mood, and their team produced a vibrant display to ensure the party went with a swing. Having been bottom for much of the season, Leicester made it 22 points from their last nine games and they finish the season in 14th place while QPR, whose relegation was sealed a fortnight ago, finished a disappointing campaign bottom of the standings. After being greeted ecstatically by the home supporters, Leicester roared out of the blocks and Leonardo Ulloa curled an early shot just wide before Jeffrey Schlupp thumped an effort into the side netting. And the hosts took the lead in the 16th minute when QPR goalkeeper Alex McCarthy fumbled a fairly weak Riyad Mahrez effort straight to Jamie Vardy, who gleefully marked his England call-up by firing home from close range. QPR manager Chris Ramsey was disappointed with their performance in their 5-1 defeat against Leicester QPR manager Chris Ramsey was disappointed with their performance in their 5-1 defeat against Leicester QPR have struggled on their travels for most of the campaign and looked fairly impotent in the first half here, although Matty Phillips went close out of nowhere when he sent a long-range effort inches wide of the post. But Leicester were soon threatening again and the lively Mahrez led a pacy counter-attack and then shot wide after a good challenge from Richard Dunne had denied Vardy. The hosts were not kept at bay for long though and doubled their advantage two minutes before the interval, when Schlupp’s cross found its way to Marc Albrighton, who rifled a superb shot into the net from just inside the area. QPR had a chance to get back into the game just after half-time but youngster Reece Grego-Cox volleyed wide from close range after a Phillips shot was deflected into his path. And Leicester then scored twice in as many minutes to virtually wrap up the victory, with just under 40 minutes still to play. There was an element of fortune about their third goal, Albrighton’s miscued effort falling nicely for Wes Morgan and his shot bouncing into the net off Ulloa (51), McCarthy getting a hand to the ball but proving unable to keep it out. But there was nothing fortuitous about number four, which arrived moments later, Esteban Cambiasso thumping a beautiful shot into the corner of the net after controlling a Dunne clearance. Like Vardy, Charlie Austin was named in the England squad this week, and he battled gamely in a losing cause, getting his reward when he produced a fine header from a Joey Barton free-kick to pull a goal back in the 57th-minute, his 17th of an excellent individual campaign. And QPR could have had another later on, Nedum Onuoha heading a Barton corner wide from close range. But the last half-hour was all about Leicester, who knocked the ball about with aplomb while the home fans made their appreciation clear, the clever Mahrez providing the highlights with some lovely bits of skill. It looked like the hosts might have to settle for just the four goals but sub Andrej Kramaric got his name on the scoresheet with four minutes left. QPR youngster Cole Kpekawa had just come on for his debut when a Schmeichel punt bounced off him and fell perfectly for Kramaric, who beat McCarthy with a powerful cross-shot. Leicester and their fans can now look forward to a pleasant summer and they will be confident of posing teams plenty more problems next term, with players such as Vardy, Albrighton and Mahrez on hand. QPR head back to the Championship and, with the contracts of several players due to expire and big money offers likely for Austin, it is probable they will field a much-different team when they begin life back in the second tier.

City on his last Premier League appearance Frank Lampard scored on his last Premier League appearance as Manchester City beat Southampton 2-0 at the Etihad Stadium. Lampard’s trademark finish from 10 yards put City 1-0 up just after the half-hour mark, having been made captain by manager Manuel Pellegrini on just his 10th league start for the club. Premier League top-scorer Sergio Aguero added the second late on from close range, his 26th goal of the season in the division. The result leaves City seven points short of last season’s total with 79, while Southampton finish seventh, and must hope Arsenal beat Aston Villa in Saturday’s FA Cup final to secure a Europa League qualifying spot despite their highest-ever Premier League finish. Frank Lampard concluded his Premier League career with a goal and a victory Frank Lampard concluded his Premier League career with a goal and a victory Saints needed a win to guarantee Europa League football, and after a slow start, Joe Hart was the first to make a save, getting down low to block Shane Long’s effort from 12 yards on the left. At the other end, Aguero had two chances in two minutes to give City the lead, first slicing an effort high and wide from an angle, before failing to beat Kelvin Davis from four yards after Yaya Toure’s low effort had been parried into the Premier League top scorer’s path. But City were ahead on 31 minutes, Lampard turning home with his left foot into the roof of the net from James Milner’s precise cutback on the right. Aguero nearly doubled City’s lead three minutes later, but again Davis was equal to his effort after being put through on goal by David Silva. Saints nearly equalised just before the break, but Graziano Pelle’s shot from 12 yards under pressure from Milner flew just wide. The visitors started the second period brighter but waited until the 74th minute for another chance. Two came at once, as Sadio Mane’s header at the back post failed to beat Hart, before Long’s low left-footed effort was easily saved. Southampton manager Ronald Koeman assessed his side's successful season Southampton manager Ronald Koeman assessed his side's successful season Each of Manchester City’s three substitutions in the second half received a standing ovation from the home crowd, with Toure and Milner, whose futures at the club remain unknown, coming off either side of Lampard. Aguero finally got his goal in the 88th minute, a ninth in seven games for the Argentine, nodding into an empty net at the far post from Eliaquim Mangala’s header across the six-yard box. It marked the 26-year-old’s best-ever season for the club, scoring 32 goals in all competitions in 2014/15.

Jonas Gutierrez was the hero as Newcastle United secured their Premier League status with a 2-0 win over West Ham United at St James’ Park. The result means the Magpies finish 15th in the table and Hull, who drew 0-0 with Manchester United, join Burnley and QPR in the Championship. On a tense and nervy afternoon, the deadlock was broken in the 54th minute when Moussa Sissoko headed home Gutierrez’s cross. There were big celebrations at St James' Park once the full-time whistle was blown There were big celebrations at St James' Park once the full-time whistle was blown Gutierrez, playing perhaps his final game for the club after recovering from testicular cancer, then scored his first goal for over two years to ensure the Magpies avoided relegation. The goal sparked wild celebrations from Gutierrez, his team-mates and Carver and more followed at the final whistle as Newcastle ended a traumatic season on a postive note. While it was joy for Newcastle and John Carver, West Ham announced immediately after the match that Sam Allardyce's contract will not be renewed. Newcastle interim manager John Carver was delighted after avoiding relegation Newcastle interim manager John Carver was delighted after avoiding relegation The former Newcastle boss took charge of the Hammers in 2011 and led them to a 12th-place finish in the league this season. But he was unable to end with a win as Newcastle got the three points that ensured they did not have to rely on the result at the KC Stadium to avoid the drop. Roared on by a full house at St James’ Park, Newcastle started on the front foot as Emmanuel Riviere dragged a shot across goal in the first minute and then missed the target with an acrobatic scissor kick from Daryl Janmaat’s cross. Janmaat then fired wide just as Hull had a couple of goals disallowed against Man United for offside.

Janmaat headed over the bar at the other end as Newcastle continued to lack composure in front of goal. That continued early in the second half when Riviere failed to make contact with Janmaat’s cross when he should have swept the ball home. However, Newcastle did get the vital breakthrough shortly afterwards as Gutierrez crossed from the left and Sissoko got up between two defenders to head past Adrian.

The game remained finally balanced heading into the closing stages with Vurnon Anita passing up a glorious opportunity to kill it off when he broke from his own half along with Sissoko, Papiss Cisse and Colback and not a claret and blue shirt in sight, but somehow managed to serve the ball up to Adrian. But Gutierrez had the final say with five minutes remaining when he smashed a skidding shot past the keeper with the help of a deflection to end the quest for survival in style.

Mame Biram Diouf fired a quick double before Jonathan Walters, Charlie Adam and a Steven N’Zonzi thunderbolt put the hosts five in front at half-time. Gerrard got on the scoresheet as he signed off with a goal in the second half, before Peter Crouch added a sixth to overtake Alan Shearer in the charts for most headed Premier League goals. The big news before the game was the omission of Raheem Sterling from the starting line-up, after a contract row which culminated in the club cancelling scheduled talks with the 20-year-old. Attention soon turned to Gerrard’s farewell, but it was to be a miserable afternoon in which he conceded five goals in a Premier League game for the first time. Brendan Rodgers apologised to the Liverpool supporters for his side's 6-1 defeat Brendan Rodgers apologised to the Liverpool supporters for his side's 6-1 defeat Tottenham’s win at Everton means the Reds end up in sixth place and they will have to await the result of the FA Cup final to see at which stage they will enter the Europa League next season. Brendan Rodgers’ men actually had the first opening of the match, when Philippe Coutinho slid the ball through for Adam Lallana, who cut inside before curling a shot around the wrong side of the far post. He would regret that soon after, as the hosts took the lead in the 22nd minute when Marko Arnautovic laid off to Adam, whose 20-yard effort was spilled by Simon Mignolet, before Diouf was there to smash in the rebound. It was 2-0 five minutes later and Arnautovic was again involved, cutting inside Emre Can before finding Diouf, who hammered an effort straight through Mignolet and into the centre of the goal. The Stoke onslaught continued in the 30th minute, when Adam floated in a deep cross from the right-hand side and Can headed back towards his own goal, only to see Walters pick it up in front of Mignolet. The Liverpool goalkeeper saved his first effort, but Walters managed to get a head to the rebound as it trickled over the line for 3-0. Steven Nzonzi said Stoke's 6-1 victory over Liverpool was a great way to end the season Steven Nzonzi said Stoke's 6-1 victory over Liverpool was a great way to end the season Liverpool were utterly shellshocked, but the Potters continued their dominance as they added a fourth in the 41st minute, when Adam caught Lucas in possession and fired a low effort from 20 yards that snuck inside the post. The Reds had never conceded four goals in the first half of a Premier League game before, but it was 5-0 at the break as, in the 45th minute, N’Zonzi picked the ball up in midfield and raced forward unopposed before curling an outstanding effort into the top corner from 25 yards. Liverpool changed shape at the back as Kolo Toure and Jordon Ibe were introduced, with the latter adding some good threat down the left-hand side. The visitors had more possession in the second half but struggled to create many openings, until the 70th minute, when substitute Rickie Lambert’s header was collected by Gerrard, who saw the pitch open up in front of him as Marc Muniesa pulled up injured, allowing the Liverpool skipper to slot a low finish into the far corner. Mark Hughes praised his Stoke side after their 6-1 win against Liverpool Mark Hughes praised his Stoke side after their 6-1 win against Liverpool But Stoke would have the final say, as Crouch entered the fray before getting on to the end of Diouf’s cross on 86 minutes, powering in his 47th headed Premier League goal to cap a remarkable victory for Hughes’ men.

Sunderland ensured their Premier League survival after grinding out a hard-fought 0-0 draw at Arsenal on Wednesday. The Gunners created a host of chances at the Emirates but the closest they came to breaking the deadlock was when Billy Jones deflected a cross on to his own crossbar. Sunderland also had opportunities of their own but Steven Fletcher twice failed to beat David Ospina. Sunderland's John O'Shea and Jermain Defoe talk after their draw with Arsenal which secured their survival Sunderland's John O'Shea and Jermain Defoe talk after their draw with Arsenal which secured their survival But the Black Cats will be more than satisfied with a point that guarantees their top-flight status for next season and means either Newcastle or Hull will be relegated on the final day. The result also all-but guarantees Arsenal third place and automatic Champions League group stage qualification as they are now three points ahead of Manchester United with a superior goal difference. Sunderland boss Dick Advocaat, who was brought in with nine games remaining to rescue the club from relegation, was left in tears at the final whistle as his mission was completed. The Dutchman has lost just two matches since taking charge and the draw at the Emirates continued an impressive end-of-season surge that has seen them go five matches unbeaten. Dick Advocaat found it difficult to hide his emotions after Sunderland confirmed their Premier League status Dick Advocaat found it difficult to hide his emotions after Sunderland confirmed their Premier League status Advocaat made just one change from the draw against Leicester at the weekend as he recalled Adam Johnson to the starting line-up for the first time since February. Hector Bellerin provided an early threat down the right with a couple of dangerous crosses while Jack Wilshere was just beaten to the ball by a sliding Costel Pantilimon. The Gunners continued to create chances but none really tested the Sunderland keeper as Mesut Ozil and Wilshere both blasted over the bar and Olivier Giroud also missed the target with a volley. Sunderland largely wasted the few opportunities they did have on the break and did not have a shot on goal until Johnson shot into the stands late in the half. Dick Advocaat is delighted with Sunderland's draw with Arsenal which means they are ensured their Premier League survival Dick Advocaat is delighted with Sunderland's draw with Arsenal which means they are ensured their Premier League survival Advocaat, who has never been relegated, looked to freshen things up for the second half as Jack Rodwell and Fletcher replaced Connor Wickham and Danny Graham. The move almost paid immediate dividends as Arsenal goalkeeper Ospina had to be alert to come out and block an angled shot from Fletcher and then stood up at the other post to deny left-back Patrick van Aanholt, who had surged forwards on the overlap. That scare sparked Arsenal into life, with Giroud getting on the end of a whipped ball in by Bellerin, which Pantilimon turned away at point-blank range, before the Sunderland goalkeeper plucked a goal-bound header from Kieran Gibbs out of the air at the far post. Arsenal opened Sunderland up again as Ozil picked out Alexis Sanchez in a crowded box, but his shot was blocked. Arsene Wenger is disappointed not getting on the scoreboard against Sunderland despite the amount of chances Arsene Wenger is disappointed not getting on the scoreboard against Sunderland despite the amount of chances Sunderland then broke suddenly through Fletcher, but his attempted chip was palmed behind by Ospina. Fletcher then wasted another excellent chance when Van Aanholt played the ball across the Arsenal penalty area from the left, but could only stab the ball over the crossbar from six yards. Theo Walcott was the next to go close as he clipped the ball over the on-rushing keeper, but Sebastian Coates came across to hack it off the line. Sunderland then enjoyed a huge slice of fortune as a cross from the right deflected off Jones and on to the bar. Arsenal continued to press Sunderland back, with substitute Tomas Rosicky, Giroud and Walcott all going close, but the visitors held on, sparking wild celebrations among the travelling support at the full-time whistle.

Jamie Carragher and Gary Neville discuss Cesc Fabregas’s unusual sending off against West Brom that could cost him at the start of next season. Cesc Fabregas received a bizarre red card as Chelsea lost their unbeaten run with a 3-0 defeat at West Brom on Monday evening. The midfielder was sent off for kicking the ball into a crowd of players as referee Mike Jones was breaking up a confrontation between Diego Costa and several West Brom defenders, after Saido Berahino had put Tony Pulis' men in front early on in the Premier League encounter. Jose Mourinho said he was unsurprised with Chelsea's performance as they were already champions, and felt Diego Costa was targeted by the West Brom players Jose Mourinho said he was unsurprised with Chelsea's performance as they were already champions, and felt Diego Costa was targeted by the West Brom players Berahino added a second from the spot shortly after the break after he was felled by John Terry in the box, while Loic Remy fired against the upright before Chris Brunt drilled in the Baggies' third to seal a comfortable victory. The result ended Chelsea's 16-game unbeaten run in the Premier League - the longest by any team in the top flight this season - and means the Blues have now lost three of their last four top-flight visits to The Hawthorns. It was a fast-paced opening to the game, despite neither side technically having anything to play for other than pride, and Callum McManaman went close with the first opening as he skipped past a defender before firing a shot from a tight angle, only to see the ball whistle across goal via a deflection. Darren Fletcher said he's delighted to be playing regular football and said Chelsea getting involved in the physical side of the game played into West Brom Darren Fletcher said he's delighted to be playing regular football and said Chelsea getting involved in the physical side of the game played into West Brom But the hosts soon took the lead as, in the ninth minute, the ball was squared to Berahino, who rolled the ball across to his right and curled a superb 20-yard strike into the bottom corner. Chelsea had not won on their previous three visits to The Hawthorns, and struggled to find their way through a well-organised home side, but they nearly fashioned an equaliser when Costa played a low cross in from the left and Eden Hazard met it from close range, only to see it take a deflection and loop over the crossbar. Then came the game's bizarre moment just before the half-hour mark. Costa and Gareth McAuley were reprimanded for shoving in the box and, while the Chelsea striker was being booked, Fabregas kicked the ball towards the crowd and hit Chris Brunt on the side of the head, prompting referee Jones to show him the red card. It took some time for the game to calm down, but the pattern of play was similar as both sides had good spells of possession. After Costa was involved again, this time being shoved to the ground by Jonas Olsson, Chelsea full-back Filipe Luis drilled the resulting free-kick from 20 yards, whipping it around the wall and drawing a firm parry from Boaz Myhill in the middle of his goal. The hosts regularly threatened on the break, and one such move forward saw James Morrison play a good ball beyond the defence for Brunt, whose low effort across goal was turned away by Thibaut Courtois. Things certainly failed to calm down after the break, as in the first minute of the second half the hosts were awarded a penalty when Brunt slid a pass through for Berahino, who was brought down by Terry inside the area. The Chelsea skipper escaped what could have been a red card, but Berahino fired the spot-kick low towards the corner as the hand of Courtois couldn't stop it going in to double the hosts' lead. It looked a long way back for Mourinho's men, but they nearly pulled one back after a superb spell of passing resulted in Ruben Loftus-Cheek finding Remy, who worked the ball to his left before drilling a low shot which hammered the post and came back out. Any hope of a comeback was extinguished on the hour mark when, after Courtois tipped over a Morrison effort, West Brom took the corner short to Brunt, who fired a stunning shot from a wide angle and it caught the goalkeeper out, sneaking in at the near post to put Pulis' men out of sight. Chelsea continued to enjoy plenty more time on the ball, and Nemanja Matic had a good chance to pull one back as Gary Cahill flicked a corner on at the near post, but the midfielder could only fire straight at Myhill from close range. It wasn't to be the visitors' night, and Mourinho's men succumbed to their first Premier League defeat since the 5-3 loss to Tottenham on New Year's Day.

Good attacking football from both teams made this perfect for the neutral. City take the win but Swansea had them on the ropes for a while. 94' SWANSEA 2-4 MAN CITY: Screams of a penalty in the Swansea box after Aguero dances his way through, but the referee waves play on. 91' SWANSEA 2-4 MAN CITY:BONY! The striker doesn't really celebrate as he scores a tap-in against his former club. 88' SWANSEA 2-3 MAN CITY:Emnes takes the set-piece and sends it straight into the wall of Manchester City defenders. 88' SWANSEA 2-3 MAN CITY: Barrow wins a free-kick after being fouled by Kolarov 25 yards from goal. 85' SWANSEA 2-3 MAN CITY: Wilfried Bony returns to his former club and comes on in place of Toure. 84' SWANSEA 2-3 MAN CITY:Hart again with another strong save. This time it's a double-handed save to deny Gomis. 83' SWANSEA 2-3 MAN CITY: Scorer Sigurdsson is replaced by Marvin Emnes with seven minutes left. 81' SWANSEA 2-3 MAN CITY:Hart with a superb save as the ball looked to be heading for the top left-hand corner of his goal after Fernandez' bullet header! The England international somehow pushes it over the bar. 80' SWANSEA 2-3 MAN CITY:Vincent Kompany replaces Fernandinho. Pellegrini clearly feels Swansea are still a threat. 78' SWANSEA 2-3 MAN CITY: Barrow cuts through the City defence after collecting Sigurdsson's pass, but his cross into the box is blocked. 77' SWANSEA 2-3 MAN CITY: Shelvey is replaced by Leon Britton. 76' SWANSEA 2-3 MAN CITY: Fernandinho hangs his leg in the way of Barrow's run and is injured and booked for his efforts. 74' SWANSEA 2-3 MAN CITY: Fabianski is beaten by Toure as City retake the lead. The shot flies under the goalkeeper's outstretched arm, and Swansea have 15 minutes to get back into this game. 73' SWANSEA 2-3 MAN CITY: TOURE! Is this what happens when you remember his birthday? 73' SWANSEA 2-2 MAN CITY: Modou Barrow replaces Nathan Dyer. 71' SWANSEA 2-2 MAN CITY: City are piling forward as they search for the goal to give them all three points. Williams gets in the way of another Silva cross to concede a corner. Mangala gets his head to the ball but it goes straight to Fabianski. Again. 67' SWANSEA 2-2 MAN CITY: Fabianski thwarts Silva as both teams search for the winner. 64' SWANSEA 2-2 MAN CITY: Gomis scores the equaliser after some awful defending from the visitors. He plays the offside trap perfectly after latching onto Richards long ball to beat Hart. 62' SWANSEA 2-2 MAN CITY: GOMIS!!!!!!!! 60' SWANSEA 1-2 MAN CITY: Kolarov's corner goes straight to Navas in the middle of the box and his chip lands perfectly in Fabianski's hands. The goalkeeper sends it up the pitch but the Swans attack is halted when Zabaleta takes out Shelvey and receives a yellow card. 58' SWANSEA 1-2 MAN CITY: Lampard leaves the Liberty Stadium pitch for the final time, to be replaced by Navas. 57' SWANSEA 1-2 MAN CITY: Silva nicks the ball off Dyer the Williams returns the favour and the captain takes a shot, but he doesn't get a good connection and Hart smothers it. 56' SWANSEA 1-2 MAN CITY: Good play between Montero and Sigurdsson results in a Swansea corner. 55' SWANSEA 1-2 MAN CITY: Shelvey is looking for a goal as his 25 yard effort has Hart shouting at his defenders as he pushes it around his far post. The home side are getting back into the game helped by City's sloppy passing. 53' SWANSEA 1-2 MAN CITY: Shelvey sends a lopping cross into the box and although Zabaleta gets a head to it isn't cleared. It falls to Lampard who heads towards the Swansea goal but his shot is easily saved by Fabianski. 50' SWANSEA 1-2 MAN CITY: City are defending in large numbers but they break quickly through Silva and Aguero, only to see Milner's cross is blocked by Williams. 49' SWANSEA 1-2 MAN CITY: The first yellow of the game goes to Milner after he halts Montero's run. The resulting free-kick falls perfectly for Hart. 48' SWANSEA 1-2 MAN CITY: That goal was Sigurdsson's seventh of the season, equaling the season high he achieved in 2011-12. Also with Swansea. 47' SWANSEA 1-2 MAN CITY: Mangala gets a head to Milner's corner but it is straight at Fabianski. 45' SWANSEA 1-2 MAN CITY: Manchester City start the second-half at the Liberty stadium. SWANSEA 1-2 MAN CITY: What a half of football! City still lead but that 45th minute goal from Sigurdsson will give Swansea belief. Two attacking sides should make for an exciting second-half. 45' SWANSEA 1-2 MAN CITY: And it is game on. Montero cuts in from the left and that man Sigurdsson is there at the edge of the box to smash it home. 45' SWANSEA 1-2 MAN CITY: SIGURDSSON SCORES! 44' SWANSEA 0-2 MAN CITY:If Swansea could get a goal before the break, it could lift their heads and the crowd's voices. 42' SWANSEA 0-2 MAN CITY: A frustrated Gomis gives away a needless free-kick as he trips and appears to stand on Mangala at this near touchline. 40' SWANSEA 0-2 MAN CITY: City could have had a penalty after Lampard goes down in the box but the referee waves play on. We've seen them given before. 39' SWANSEA 0-2 MAN CITY: City currently looking a different team from the opening 20 minutes. It could be a long six minutes until half-time for Swansea. 36' SWANSEA 0-2 MAN CITY: A lovely goal for Milner. Lampard's long pass finds Aguero down the left and he plays in Milner on the edge of the box. The midfielder shoots across Fabianski and the ball goes in at the far post. What a turnaround. 35' SWANSEA 0-2 MAN CITY: MILNER EXTENDS CITY'S LEAD! 32' SWANSEA 0-1 MAN CITY: Gomis has a chance to get the leveller but again he's unable to really trouble Hart. 30' SWANSEA 0-1 MAN CITY: Cork nearly has a howler after the ball bounces off his knee as he tries to clear, but luckily Fabianski is there to collect. 26' SWANSEA 0-1 MAN CITY: Swansea are still on the attack as they look to make their possession count. Shelvey side foots the ball to Gomis just outside the box but he can't control it. City break and Kolarov sends the ball across the goal for Lampard, but Taylor is there to send it over the bar. 23' SWANSEA 0-1 MAN CITY: Garry Monk will hope his side don't let their heads drop as they had been the better side for much of the opening 20 minutes. 21' SWANSEA 0-1 MAN CITY: Fabianski will be disappointed with that goal. Silva plays in Toure on the edge of the box and the midfielder shoots through a crowd of players. The 'keeper did get a hand to the ball, but he's thwarted by the deflection off Williams' shin pad. 20' SWANSEA 0-1 MAN CITY: TOURE GIVES CITY THE LEAD! 20' SWANSEA 0-0 MAN CITY: City are finally getting into the game as Lampard and Toure link-up well, but Williams clears to give City a corner which is then cleared by Shelvey. 18' SWANSEA 0-0 MAN CITY: The ball is in the back of the net after Aguero latches onto Lampard's through ball, but the striker is offside. Replays suggest it was the correct decision. 16' SWANSEA 0-0 MAN CITY: A superb save by Hart after Mangala doesn't clear the ball, allowing it to bounce and Dyer is there to make the most of his mistake and take a shot. Hart comes out and pushes it wide of the far post. 15' SWANSEA 0-0 MAN CITY: Silva finally gets on the ball for City and Dyer sloppily catches his ankle as the Spaniard passes to Kolarov. The visitors have a free-kick about 30 yards from goal. Kolarov manages to get it over the wall but it's wide of the goal. 14' SWANSEA 0-0 MAN CITY: City are living dangerously with Shelvey playing a lovely ball through the City back-line and Gomis looks to be through on goal but Kolarov recovers well to clear the danger. 12' SWANSEA 0-0 MAN CITY: sigurdsson takes the corner and Gomis jumps highest but can't get his head over the ball and it sails over the bar. 11' SWANSEA 0-0 MAN CITY: Shelvey crosses from the right and the ball looks to be going out but the lively Montero is there to keep it in play. Zabaleta heads out to give Swansea a corner. 10' SWANSEA 0-0 MAN CITY: Gomis with a great chance. Montero cuts in from the left and passes to Taylor - who was miles offside. Gomis can't get the defenders pass under control and skies his shot into the crowd. The Swans are looking very good right now. 7' SWANSEA 0-0 MAN CITY:The home team are definitely more positive of the two at the moment, with their defenders pushing up high as Fernandez plays out from the back. 6' SWANSEA 0-0 MAN CITY:Fernadinho gives away a free-kick with a needless tackle and Shelvey steps up to take. He sends it along the floor and City easily clear it. 4' SWANSEA 0-0 MAN CITY:City need Toure to be at his best if they are to really trouble Swansea today. He has been involved, with a few simple passes that led to nothing. 2' SWANSEA 0-0 MAN CITY: Save from Hart from Gomis. A great through ball by Shelvey finds the striker and he weaves his way through the visiting defenders but there is not enough power in his shot to test the England goalkeeper. 1' SWANSEA 0-0 MAN CITY: The home side already look keen to attack with Sigurdsson pushing up as they look to get the ball in behind the Manchester City defence. SWANSEA 0-0 MAN CITY: We are off! We are moments away from kick-off. Two teams in good form should produce a great game. Fabianski had a superb game against Arsenal at the Emirates, with support from his defense. Can he make it to 'man of the match' awards in a row? The teams are in the tunnel and we are five minutes from kick-off, at the start of another Super Sunday. Garry Monk has said he 'wants the players to enjoy their final home game of the season'. As many clubs have found, you cannot forget about Frank Lampard. Can he get on the score-sheet in what is like to be his penultimate game in the Premier League? The match could be won in midfield today with Gylfi Sigurdsson directly involved in (scored or assisted) 36.4% of Swansea's Premier League goals this season. Since returning from Tottenham he has been a key man for Garry Monk's team. With just over 15 minutes until kick-off, the players are warming up on the gorgeous pitch at the Liberty Stadium. Our Sky Sports pundit Paul Merson gave his prediction ahead of today's game. He said: 'Man City seem to be playing well again now and are finally back to their best form of earlier in the season after last week's thrashing of QPR. I just cannot see them losing this one. I think City will be too strong and have too much for Swansea here, winning 3-1.' PELLEGRINI: 'Football is always a state of mood and at this moment it's a good moment for our team. If we win our games we have more possibilities to get second place. That's the place to be if you can't win the title, so it's important to try and finish the season playing the way we are.' FANCY A PUNT? Manchester City are Sky Bet's 4/6 favourites on Super Sunday, with Swansea 15/4 to cause another upset and 3/1 to secure a draw. City's thumping of QPR combined with the Swans beating Arsenal saw Manuel Pellegrini's men cut from 6/4 to just 2/7 to secure second spot. Sergio Aguero heads the first goalscorer betting at 100/30 and is 20/1 for another hat-trick, while Bafetimbi Gomis is considered the hosts' main threat at 8/1. Wilfried Bony will start on the bench against his old club as City look to secure second spot and automatic Champions League qualification. Swansea are currently 8th in the league and will go into this game full of confidence, while Manchester City need to give their fans something to cheer after losing the Premier League title to Chelsea. MAN CITY XI: Hart, Zabaleta, Demichelis, Mangala, Kolarov, Fernandinho, Milner, Toure, Lampard, Silva, Aguero. SWANSEA XI: Fabianski, Richards, Fernandez, Williams, Taylor, Cork, Shelvey, Dyer, Sigurdsson, Montero, Gomis."},{"date": "17/05/2015", "arena": "Old Trafford", "attendance": 75323, "home_team": {"name": "Manchester United", "lineup": [{"name": "David De Gea", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [74]}, {"name": "Antonio Valencia", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Smalling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Jones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marcos Rojo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [73]}, {"name": "Daley Blind", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Juan Mata", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ander Herrera", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marouane Fellaini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Young", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Falcao", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [61]}], "subs": [{"name": "Ángel di María", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adnan Januzaj", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robin van Persie", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [61], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Valdes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [74], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paddy McNair", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tyler Blackett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [82], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [73], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Wilson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Arsenal", "lineup": [{"name": "David Ospina", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Hector Bellerin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [72]}, {"name": "Per Mertesacker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Laurent Koscielny", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nacho Monreal", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Francis Coquelin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Santi Cazorla", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [73]}, {"name": "Aaron Ramsey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mesut Özil", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alexis Sánchez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Olivier Giroud", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Wojciech Szczesny", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kieran Gibbs", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gabriel Paulista", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tomas Rosicky", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Wilshere", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [73], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Theo Walcott", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [72], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mathieu Flamini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Tyler Blackett's late own goal handed Arsenal a share of the spoils at Manchester United and kept them in pole position for a top-three finish in the Premier League. Louis van Gaal’s side made the perfect start at Old Trafford thanks to Ander Herrera’s 30th-minute volley but they could not add to their lead despite being in the ascendancy for much of the opening 60 minutes. Phil Jones had to undertake some unorthodox defending to deny Olivier Giroud Phil Jones had to undertake some unorthodox defending to deny Olivier Giroud The visitors threw on Theo Walcott and Jack Wilshere for the last 20 minutes and the move paid dividends seven minutes from time, Walcott’s cross deflecing off Blackett and past Victor Valdes to maintain the Gunners' two-point lead over their hosts. Manchester City’s win earlier in the day secured them a top-three spot finish but Arsenal, who face Sunderland on Wednesday, now need just two points from their last two games to secure a direct passage into the Champions League without the burden of the play-off round. Despite their history of titanic battles, this was a low-key meeting which might be remembered more for apparent goodbyes, misfiring Radamel Falcao waving to all four corners of the ground when he was replaced in the second half, before Real Madrid target David de Gea saluted the United fans as he came off with an injury to be replaced by Valdes. Theo Walcott is targeting a starting place in Arsenal's cup final side Theo Walcott is targeting a starting place in Arsenal's cup final side In what was their final home game of the season, Manchester United started brightly and Arsenal needed Laurent Koscielny to make two crucial interventions from Ashley Young’s cross and Falcao’s shot. It was clear to see Arsenal were trying to hit United on the break and the plan nearly worked in the 21st minute when Giroud got in behind a stumbling Phil Jones, only the England defender to head the ball against the Frenchman while scrambling on the floor. Jones was living dangerously and he nearly had another calamity when his back-pass nearly caught out the onrushing De Gea and rolled into the path of Olivier Giroud, who would have had a tap-in had the Spaniard not got a boot to the ball. Minutes later and it was all change in the mood around Old Trafford as the in-from Young turned Hector Bellerin inside out, before standing up a cross to the back post which Herrera volleyed into the back of the net. Graeme Souness and Thierry Henry urge Arsenal to spend big this summer Graeme Souness and Thierry Henry urge Arsenal to spend big this summer Arsenal failed to manage a single shot in the first half - the first time in a single half of a Premier League match they had failed to do so since November 2004. Arsene Wenger would have asked for a response from his players after the break and they gradually worked their way back into proceedings. Giroud, who cut an isolated figure in the opening 45 minutes, flicked the ball into the path of Alexis Sanchez, but the Chilean could not direct his effort on target. Van Gaal responded by sending for former Arsenal striker Robin van Persie and he replaced Falcao - a man who has managed just four goals in 28 appearances - with 30 minutes remaining. Louis van Gaal claims he wants more from his Manchester United squad next season Louis van Gaal claims he wants more from his Manchester United squad next season However, it was Arsenal who were finishing the stronger and Mesut Ozil picked out Giroud, who turned his man at the near post, but could not beat De Gea. Ramsey was next to go close for the visitors as he latched onto Sanchez’s through-ball. The Welshman lifted the ball over De Gea but he could not beat Marcos Rojo, who cleared the danger. It was to be De Gea’s last involvement as Valdez came on for his Manchester United debut but it was not to be a happy one as he was picking the ball out of the net just minutes after entering the action. With just seven minutes of normal time remaining, substitute Walcott broke down the right before his attempted cross deflected off Blackett to leave Valdes stranded. It handed the Gunners their first Premier League point at Old Trafford in six years and it leaves them needing just two from their last two games to claim a first top-three finish since 2012 - Sunderland their visitors on Wednesday, live on Sky Sports.

The 23-year-old fired three goals in two minutes and 56 seconds – eclipsing Robbie Fowler’s record of four minutes and 33 seconds – to put the hosts three up after just 16 minutes, before Shane Long tapped one in and struck a superb fifth from long-range. Christian Benteke pulled one back to make it 5-1 at half-time, but Graziano Pelle then blasted in a sixth late in the second half as Ronald Koeman’s men enjoyed a fine afternoon with their first win in five top-flight outings. Villa needed a win to guarantee Premier League safety ahead of the day's other games, but Hull's defeat at Tottenham later on Saturday confirmed their survival, as it leaves Tim Sherwood's men four points clear of the Tigers going into the last game of the season. Watch Alan McInally and Jeff Stelling's reaction to Sadio Mane's record breaking 2 minute 56 seconds hat-trick against Aston Villa Watch Alan McInally and Jeff Stelling's reaction to Sadio Mane's record breaking 2 minute 56 seconds hat-trick against Aston Villa It initially looked like Southampton might not be in luck as Graziano Pelle met Nathaniel Clyne's ball from the right and fired a low first-time shot into the net, only to be wrongly flagged offside. But on 13 minutes the Villa capitulation started as Mane latched on to Pelle’s flick before racing into the box, the ball rebounding off Shay Given before the Senegal international fired the ball into an empty net. Just over a minute later, Ron Vlaar’s misplaced pass back to Given was intercepted by Long, who managed to win a challenge with the goalkeeper as the ball fell for Mane, who again had an open goal to fire into. Sadio Mane scores Southampton's first on 13 minutes The hat-trick was then complete two minutes and 56 seconds after his first as Long charged down the left-hand side and squared it to the edge of the box, Mane firing an excellent first-time finish into the top corner to register his record treble. It was nearly 4-0 two minutes later when Sherwood’s men couldn’t deal with another ball over the top, this time from Nathaniel Clyne, but James Ward-Prowse could only fire his shot straight at Given. The home fans did not have to wait too long for the fourth, though, as on 26 minutes Mane slotted an excellent ball through the defence looking for Pelle, whose low effort was turned away by Given before Long was there to meet the rebound. Mane's hat-trick is also the fastest from kick-off Villa were shellshocked, and it got even worse as Long registered his second in the 38th minute, catching Ashley Westwood in possession before spotting Given off his line and curling a stunning 40-yard strike into the net. Benteke pulled one back in first-half stoppage time as he powered a header into the top corner from Leandro Bacuna’s cross - Villa’s 500th Premier League goal away from home - but the damage had already been done. Southampton took their foot off the gas in the second half with the three points already secured, but Villa struggled to create anything meaningful as the Saints’ defence coped with every cross and long ball. Substitute Maya Yoshida almost scored with his first touch after coming on, meeting Ward-Prowse’s corner with a powerful header, only to see it parried away by Given. Long scored two goals including a stunner from 40 yards On 81 minutes, though, the sixth goal came as Mane turned provider, picking the ball up on the right and drilling in a low cross for Pelle, who left the hapless Jores Okore in his wake and blasted a first-time finish into the roof of the net. Villa had a couple of chances late on as substitute Gabriel Agbonlahor fired Alan Hutton’s low ball straight at Paulo Gazzaniga, before he tested the goalkeeper with another low drive across goal, but the Southampton shot-stopper turned it away with a good save.

The home side appeared keen to sign off at home with victory but Jack Butland impressed under the watchful eye of England U21 manager Gareth Southgate as he foiled compatriot Danny Ings and the lively Ashley Barnes. Mame Biram Diouf could have grabbed all three points for Stoke but was only able to fire one of his efforts on target and that was smothered by Clarets goalkeeper Tom Heaton. Burnley return to the Championship with their heads held high, while the Potters will achieve consecutive top-10 finishes with a record points total of at least 51. After Stoke surpassed their Premier League points total with a goalless draw against Burnley, manager Mark Hughes told Sky Sports he's been satisfied with After Stoke surpassed their Premier League points total with a goalless draw against Burnley, manager Mark Hughes told Sky Sports he's been satisfied with The Clarets' relegation was confirmed last weekend, but that didn't stop them starting the game in energetic form. They had all the early chances, but Butland stood firm in just his third Premier League appearance of the season. His first save came from Ben Mee 15 minutes into the game, before Ings - expected to depart in the summer - tried to test him, the 22-year-old pushing the ball to safety on his right. It took 20 minutes for Stoke to create anything that resembled a real chance as Marko Arnautovic crossed into the box from the left, but no one was there to get a touch on it. Burnley went straight up the other end with Ings in on goal but he failed to get enough power behind the ball and Butland dropped low to collect it. Matt Le Tissier believes Burnley were fortunate to manage a draw with Stoke City in the Premier League. Matt Le Tissier believes Burnley were fortunate to manage a draw with Stoke City in the Premier League. The visitors' play got better towards the end of the first half with Charlie Adam, in particular, trying to give his side the lead. Five minutes before the break, Jonathon Walters crossed expertly from the edge of the box but Diouf could only head wide. It was a sign of things to come for the striker. The home side thought they should have had a penalty at the start of the second half after Arnautovic’s lightweight back-pass saw Shawcross and Barnes go down in the box as Butland cleared, but the referee waved play on. In the 53rd minute Barnes sent a ball across goal that deserved to be converted but neither Ings or former Bolton player Matthew Taylor was alert enough to knock it past Heaton. Burnley manager Sean Dyche says he's proud of his team's performance against Stoke even though their fate in the Premier League had been sealed last week. Burnley manager Sean Dyche says he's proud of his team's performance against Stoke even though their fate in the Premier League had been sealed last week. Taylor’s next involvement came on the hour mark when his shot from 15 yards was deflected and Butland was there to send it wide. Many thought Jason Shakell had gifted Diouf a goal in the 66th minute when he allowed the Stoke striker to get goal side, but once again the Senegal international missed the target. As the game wore on neither team seemed keen to exert too much energy, a touch of quality to break the deadlock proving elusive. Matt le Tissier's Soccer Saturday verdict \"Burnley started the first half very well and they had chances but I don’t know if it’s a lack of composure or a lack of confidence in front of goal. In the end they were maybe a little bit fortunate to get away with a point because the best chances of the game both fell to Mame Biram Diouf at the end. \"Stoke would probably argue they could have taken three points from this game but Burnley were just a little bit toothless.

John Carver's side will now have to beat West Ham at home to ensure their safety, but if they fail to do so - and Hull manage to get the better of Manchester United at the KC Stadium - they will be relegated to the Championship. QPR's fate was sealed before today's encounter, but Chris Ramsey will have boosted his chances of securing the permanent manager's job at Loftus Road after a rousing second-half comeback from his side. John Carver: Blamed defeat on a 'mad 10 minutes' John Carver: Blamed defeat on a 'mad 10 minutes' With little to play for, the R’s looked like they were bereft of enthusiasm early on, and it wasn’t long before the visitors took the lead. Nothing seemed to be on as Krul launched a long kick upfield after 24 minutes, but the R’s backline simply watched the ball sail over their heads into the path of Riviere, who scuffed his shot over the onrushing Robert Green to score his first goal in over 18 hours of top flight football. Green’s afternoon ended shortly after, following a collison with Joey Barton’s knee, with Alex McCarthy coming on to deputise. The break could not come soon enough for Ramsey’s men as they struggled to create any real openings, Charlie Austin isolated up front.

The otherwise ineffective Remy Cabella went close down the other end almost immediately, but in a game of little quality, Fer provided a real bolt out of the blue to snatch the lead. On 61 minutes, from 30 yards, Fer unleashed an unstoppable shot which beat Krul and gave the hosts a lead they never really looked like relinquishing. Chris Ramsey dedicated their 2-1 win over Newcastle to the QPR fans Chris Ramsey dedicated their 2-1 win over Newcastle to the QPR fans Phillips went close to adding a third, but blazed over from close range, before substitute Papiss Cisse almost snatched an unlikely point at the death.

The result caps an amazing escape for Leicester, who have been bottom of the standings for much of the campaign but survive with a game to spare after a embarking on a superb run of form. But despite Hull’s defeat at Tottenham, Sunderland could yet be in for a nervy final week, as they need at least a point from tough trips to Arsenal and Chelsea if they are to be certain of survival. Dick Advocaat's side just about had the better of this encounter but could not get the breakthrough and they will need another point from somewhere if Hull manage to beat Manchester United next week. Sunderland manager Dick Advocaat was satisfied with his sides draw against Leicester Sunderland manager Dick Advocaat was satisfied with his sides draw against Leicester The Black Cats started the afternoon brightly and had an early penalty shout when the lively Danny Graham crossed and Connor Wickham went down under pressure from Robert Huth, referee Martin Atkinson was unmoved. With the Leicester defence expecting a cross, Seb Larsson then sent a clever free-kick towards the bottom corner and Kasper Schmeichel dived to his right to pull off an excellent one-handed save. Leicester then threatened, Leonardo Ulloa inches away from getting on the end of Marc Albrighton’s nod back into the goal mouth, before Jamie Vardy had a shot blocked when the ball came back in. That was about as good as it got for the Foxes in the first half though and Schmeichel was soon back in action, blocking a Graham volley after the forward had been picked out by a delightful floated pass from Lee Cattermole. Leicester will be playing top flight football next season and Nigel Pearson thinks it’s all down to the players always believing they would survive Leicester will be playing top flight football next season and Nigel Pearson thinks it’s all down to the players always believing they would survive Wickham then got plenty of power on a half-volley from the edge of the box but it flew wide of the target and it was goalless at half-time. Ulloa nodded a corner wide at the start of the second half but the game then went through a scrappy phase, although both sets of fans were buoyed by the news that Tottenham were beating Hull and that QPR had fought back to lead against Newcastle. Sunderland perked up over the final 25 minutes and Patrick van Aanholt was not far away with a low drive from the edge of the box. Adam Johnson came off the bench and made an impact, eluding Esteban Cambiasso and drawing a decent save from Schmeichel with a low shot from 20 yards out. Johnson then sent over a fine cross from the right and his fellow sub Steven Fletcher glanced a header not far wide of the target. Wes Morgan and Kasper Schmeichel couldn't hide their delight after securing Premier League football for next season Wes Morgan and Kasper Schmeichel couldn't hide their delight after securing Premier League football for next season However, out of nowhere, Leicester were handed a fantastic chance to score an injury-time winner when John O’Shea and goalkeeper Costel Pantilimon made a terrible mess of dealing with a fairly innocuous through pass and presented the ball to Andrej Kramaric on the edge of the box. There were just a couple of defenders between the Leicester sub and the goal but he produced a tame effort which drifted wide of the target. The miss proved irrelevant as far as Leicester were concerned, the final whistle coming soon afterwards and prompting jubilant celebrations from the away side. Sunderland, meanwhile, will get their first chance to guarantee Premier League survival when they travel to the Emirates on Wednesday night. Charlie Nicholas's Soccer Saturday verdict \"I thought a point was a fair reflection. \"I thought Sunderland started well, with good intent. They had a good chance from a wonderful Cattermole pass and Graham caught it well, but Schmeichel was equal to it. \"Leicester were a threat but never really looked like making too many chances. So, 0-0, but it didn’t feel like a 0-0. There were a lot of young kids running about, with wholehearted determination, but it just lacked some quality.\" Charlie Nicholas gives his thoughts on the 0-0 draw between Leicester and Sunderland

them to defeat at Tottenham. Nacer Chadli and Danny Rose both beat the offside trap inside seven second-half minutes to thwart a Hull side who had made a good start to the second half and had held their own for the majority of the first. Spurs will secure a place in the Europa League if they finish with victory against Everton but the loss completes a bad week for the Tigers, who lost midfielder Jake Livermore to a suspension following a positive drugs test. Hull are on the brink of relegation but Steve Bruce has told his player that they need to keep fighting Hull are on the brink of relegation but Steve Bruce has told his player that they need to keep fighting Hull must beat Manchester United at the KC Stadium in the final round of fixtures and hope Sunderland and Newcastle United - who remain in the mix following a 2-1 loss at QPR - are both beaten. A Newcastle draw could also see them safe but only if the Red Devils are beaten. At White Hart Lane, Steve Bruce’s side paid the price for their failure to capitalise on their strong periods and in particular the failure of Nikica Jelavic to take the only genuine chance of the first half. After 18 minutes of even exchanges, a counter-attack saw the ball crossed from the right wing by Ahmed Elmohamady and land at the feet of Jelavic, who struck it first time with his left foot, beating Hugo Lloris with power but not the angle of post and bar. Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino wants his team to build on their win over Hull and claim a Europa League spot for next season Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino wants his team to build on their win over Hull and claim a Europa League spot for next season Tottenham did not enjoy a multitude of chances themselves, instead preferring to keep the ball rather than take risks in attacking situations, although they might have done better had Harry Kane opted to shoot rather than pass when in a good position after 27 minutes. Hull began the second half well and had forced three corners before Spurs made the breakthrough, Chadli collecting a reverse pass from Erik Lamela and going past Steve Harper with his first touch before depositing the ball in the net with his second in the 54th minute. There was a vague hint of offside about that goal but no doubts on the second, Ryan Mason clipping a superb pass into the path of Rose, who drove it past Harper with his weaker right foot and in a somewhat scuffed fashion. The timing of the goals left Hull reeling and they struggled to get a foothold thereafter, Spurs passing the ball around with the assuredness of their cushion. Goalscorer Danny Rose says Spurs needed to win to keep their chances alive of playing Europa League football next season Goalscorer Danny Rose says Spurs needed to win to keep their chances alive of playing Europa League football next season They will wonder how they did not score when substitute Abel Hernandez twice had efforts blocked by defenders, the second almost on the goal-line, and Dame N’Doye thrashed wide, all in the space of 10 frantic seconds. But they were not costly misses – that had come earlier in the game, when Jelavic had struck the woodwork with the score at 0-0. A goal then might have changed the course of the match - and quite possibly have altered the grim destiny which, it now seems, awaits Hull City. Phil Thompson's Soccer Saturday verdict \"To win the game against Manchester United you have to score a goal and you wonder how that’s going to happen. They’ve had enough opportunities today. It was against the run of play but when you look through the Spurs side there’s probably more quality. \"They didn’t exactly show a lot of it, Spurs, but you thought with this Hull side everything’s against them.

But the Belgian stole in to head Aiden McGeady's cross in from three yards out in the third minute of stoppage time. In a subdued first-half neither side were able to create many chances although West Ham will feel they should have been awarded a penalty in the 13th minute when Aaron Cresswell’s cross clearly struck Seamus Coleman’s hand.

The former Liverpool man turned Gareth Barry in the middle of the pitch before surging forward and driving a shot at goal, only for Tim Howard to beat it to safety. With little to play for for either side it was no surprise that it took a goal to shake the game out of its slumber.

Everton responded well though and hit back soon after. Lukaku crossed from the right and Osman controlled the ball well before hooking the ball into the back of the net. From that moment the game opened up with both sides pushing for a winner, but neither was able to create a clear-cut goalscoring opportunity before Lukaku's last gasp intervention.

Liverpool took the lead when Adam Lallana punished Martin Kelly’s mistake with a fine finish after 26 minutes, but Palace then assumed control of the game and equalised through the outstanding Jason Puncheon’s free-kick two minutes before the break. Steven Gerrard was given a guard of honour as he walked out for the final time at Anfield Steven Gerrard was given a guard of honour as he walked out for the final time at Anfield The visitors moved ahead when Wilfried Zaha bundled home in the 60th minute with his first touch just 23 seconds after coming on, and fellow substitute Glenn Murray wrapped up the victory by stroking home the rebound from his own saved penalty in injury time. Driven on by a visibly motivated Gerrard, Liverpool applied heavy pressure in the last 15 minutes but Palace fully warranted the three points and denied a captain desperate to end on a winning note at home. Steven Gerrard speaks to David Jones, Jamie Carragher and Jamie Redknapp after his final game at Anfield as captain of Liverpool Steven Gerrard speaks to David Jones, Jamie Carragher and Jamie Redknapp after his final game at Anfield as captain of Liverpool The result sees Liverpool remain fifth and mathematically ends their chances of finishing in the top four, while Palace stay 12th but are now just two points off the top half. Prior to kick-off, Gerrard emerged from the tunnel with his three daughters to a guard of honour from the two teams and a rousing rendition of You’ll Never Walk Alone from the Liverpool fans. The first 25 minutes passed without incident as the game took on the feel of a testimonial, but then the hosts were gifted the lead when former player Kelly misplaced a pass to central defensive partner Scott Dann and inadvertently played in Lallana, who finished well high into the top-left corner. Steven Gerrard bids an emotional farewell to Anfield and the fans he calls 'the best in the world' Steven Gerrard bids an emotional farewell to Anfield and the fans he calls 'the best in the world' Palace had begun to show signs of improvement prior to the goal and they created four excellent chances to equalise in the next eight minutes. After Joe Ledley and Yannick Bolasie had blazed over from the edge of the box, Puncheon had a curling shot well saved by Simon Mignolet and then Chung-Yong Lee scooped over with a back-post volley following a corner. The visitors were now well on top and they deservedly levelled when Emre Can scythed down the marauding Bolasie and Puncheon subsequently scored a set piece for the second Saturday in succession by sweeping the resulting free-kick across goal and into Mignolet’s bottom left-hand corner. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers believes his side will miss Steven Gerrard's determination and professionalism once he leaves the club Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers believes his side will miss Steven Gerrard's determination and professionalism once he leaves the club Liverpool’s back three was struggling to cope with Palace’s lively front trio of Puncheon, Marouane Chamakh and Bolasie, but Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers persisted with his 3-4-3 formation and Alan Pardew's side duly continued to benefit after the break. Puncheon fired over within two minutes of the restart and then the visitors had two penalties turned down in quick succession, both of which appeared to be valid claims. Liverpool finally woke up just before the hour and went close with efforts from Philippe Coutinho and Jordan Henderson, but Palace continued to push on and deservedly took the lead when Zaha scuffed home Bolasie’s low right-wing cross.

Arsene Wenger is looking to lead his side to their highest Premier League finish in 10 years but their chances were dealt a blow as Gomis' 85th-minute header crossed the line, despite David Ospina's attempt to claw it away. Arsenal protested the ball had not gone in but referee Kevin Friend, aided by goal-line technology, was in no doubt as the goal stood to send Swansea to victory. Watch Bafetimbi Gomis' winning goal, with analysis from MNF pundits Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher Watch Bafetimbi Gomis' winning goal, with analysis from MNF pundits Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher Garry Monk’s side, who are now well in with a chance of Europa League qualification with two games remaining, also had former Arsenal goalkeeper Lukas Fabianski to thank for their victory as he made a string of excellent saves in the second half. In particular, a fine double save from Alexis Sanchez and Theo Walcott helped send the Gunners to a first league defeat in 10 and hand Swansea only their second league double over Arsenal. For the first time in Wenger’s reign he named the same starting line-up for the fifth consecutive Premier League game after Aaron Ramsey was passed fit following a leg injury. Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger said it was frustrating that his side failed to capitalise on all the chances they created against Swansea Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger said it was frustrating that his side failed to capitalise on all the chances they created against Swansea And Arsenal tried to start in the same vein that has seen them win nine of their last 10 league games as Ramsey combined with Mesut Ozil and Hector Bellerin before clipping a cross to Olivier Giroud, who headed over from 10 yards. Monk had set up to hit Arsenal on the break and it nearly worked as Ashley Williams’s long pass nearly dropped into the path of Nathan Dyer, but Ospina was quickly off his line to head the ball to safety. Arsenal were trying to pass their way through but it was to Swansea’s credit that all the hosts could muster was Giroud’s curled effort from 25 yards which flew wide of Fabianski’s goal. The former Arsenal man would have been expecting a busier night but the Gunners failed to register a single shot on target in the first half. However, with 21 of the last 22 goals in this fixture in all competitions coming in the second half of the match, Wenger would have been pleading for patience from his troops and a much improved performance. And that is what he got as Arsenal probed to make the breakthrough with Bellerin breaking free down the right before crossing for Giroud, but he was beaten to the ball by Federico Fernandez. Giroud was again in the action in the 59th minute but the impressive Fabianki was in the way, getting down well to his right to make a smart save. Swansea's Ashley Williams heaped praise on man-of-the-match Lukasz Fabianski after the former Arsenal keeper kept a clean sheet Swansea's Ashley Williams heaped praise on man-of-the-match Lukasz Fabianski after the former Arsenal keeper kept a clean sheet Wenger sent for reinforcements in Jack Wilshere and Walcott and the latter could have made an instant impact when sending Bellerin’s cross goalwards, but Fabianski was well positioned to keep his goal intact. Ramsey also tested his former team-mate but the keeper's best moment came in the 78th minute as he first denied Sanchez from close range and then got up to keep Walcott’s effort out. It got even better for Swansea with just five minutes remaining as Gomis struck the only goal of the match. Swansea boss Garry Monk said his side know how to adapt to get victory in different ways - and that's exactly what they had to do against Arsenal Swansea boss Garry Monk said his side know how to adapt to get victory in different ways - and that's exactly what they had to do against Arsenal The Frenchman was the matchwinner when the two sides met earlier in the season and he was a thorn in Arsenal’s side again as he rose to head Jefferson Montero’s shot over the line. Ospina got across to claw the ball away but it was not enough as Friend awarded the goal with the help of goal line technology. It sent Arsenal crashing to their first defeat in 10 league matches as they bid to finish in second place behind champions Chelsea. Wenger’s men, who stay third, are now three points behind Manchester City with a game in hand but face Manchester United, who are just two points behind, at the weekend. Victory moves Swansea, who are a point behind Southampton in seventh and two points behind Tottenham in sixth, firmly into the race for the Europa League as they became the first side to complete a league double against Arsenal this season.

Steven Gerrard was given a standing ovation by both Liverpool and Chelsea fans when he was substituted in the 78th minute Steven Gerrard was given a standing ovation by both Liverpool and Chelsea fans when he was substituted in the 78th minute John Terry headed the hosts in front early on, before Steven Gerrard equalised shortly before half time. The visitors enjoyed more of the possession in the second half and Philippe Coutinho went close as he fired wide, but Liverpool couldn't find the winner they needed to close the gap on Manchester United in fourth. The result means Jose Mourinho continues his unbeaten record against Liverpool, and leaves Brendan Rodgers’ men six points off fourth place with two games left, effectively ending their Champions League hopes owing to their inferior goal difference compared to United. Martin Tyler hails Gerrard Martin Tyler hails Gerrard Liverpool afforded the newly crowned champions a guard of honour as they came on to the pitch, but Chelsea were in no mood to relax and Cesc Fabregas came out firing, catching Raheem Sterling with a late challenge to earn a booking inside the first minute. The visitors then allowed Blues skipper Terry too much space in the box from Fabregas’ corner, with the defender rising above Rickie Lambert to power a header into the corner as Simon Mignolet and Gerrard failed to keep it out, and Chelsea were ahead inside five minutes. The party spirit was in full swing as Chelsea looked more expansive than in their recent matches, with the pressure of securing the title lifted from their shoulders. Diego Costa took a seat among the fans to watch his team-mates in action, with the striker ruled out due to a hamstring injury. But Liverpool had something to play for and enjoyed some spells of possession, with Philippe Coutinho going close with a couple of efforts, his first deflecting wide off Filipe Luis from 20 yards before he cut inside Kurt Zouma and saw a low shot saved by Thibaut Courtois. Gerrard believes Liverpool need to build for next season Gerrard believes Liverpool need to build for next season For most of the half Chelsea looked comfortable and the visitors were struggling with the threat of Mourinho’s men down the left flank, but they drew level after Branislav Ivanovic was booked for hauling down Adam Lallana near the corner flag in the 44th minute. Jordan Henderson whipped in the resulting free kick and Gerrard popped up unmarked at the far post, nodding it down into the net to level things right before the break. Before kick-off, Liverpool gave champions Chelsea the guard of honour Before kick-off, Liverpool gave champions Chelsea the guard of honour The visitors started the second half the brighter of the two sides, and Coutinho had a glorious opportunity to put his side in front, but he could only fire his first-time shot wide of the post after good work by Raheem Sterling down the left. Willian had a couple of chances in quick succession for the hosts, drilling one shot just wide of the far post from a tight angle before seeing a second effort diverted behind by Martin Skrtel from the same position. The hosts introduced Nemanja Matic on the hour mark, and Chelsea almost immediately looked more solid in the middle of the park, but Liverpool were still seeing plenty more of the ball. Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho pays tribute to Gerrard Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho pays tribute to Gerrard Chelsea were creating some good openings, though, and Fabregas bundled his way through the Liverpool defence before firing a low left-footed effort, only to see Skrtel make another excellent last-ditch block. With 10 minutes remaining, Gerrard was brought off and Mourinho led the applause around Stamford Bridge as fans of both sides paid their respects to the outgoing Liverpool midfielder. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers was disappointed with John Terry's goal Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers was disappointed with John Terry's goal Coutinho’s deflected effort, meanwhile, was saved by Courtois late on, while Jordan Henderson fired an 18-yard volley wide of the target, with neither side able to find the winner.

Sunderland moved out of the drop zone with a 2-0 win at Everton as the fight for Premier League survival took another dramatic turn. Danny Graham scored his first goal for the club, inadvertently turning home a Jordi Gomez strike on 54 minutes at Goodison Park, and Jermain Defoe added a late second to catapult the visitors out of the relegation zone and into 14th place - for a couple of hours at least. Everton dominated the match for long periods, winning 15 corners and hitting a post through James McCarthy, but despite creating plenty of opportunities, they only mustered four shots on target. Sunderland boss Dick Advocaat has now taken 10 points from a possible 18 since taking over from Gus Poyet at the end of March and his side have 36 points in total, with three fixtures remaining against Leicester, Arsenal and Chelsea. Jermain Defoe of Sunderland celebrates scoring his team's second goal. Sunderland started in a defensive 4-5-1 system with Defoe on the right wing and Everton found their stride quickly. Leon Osman found space on the edge of the area inside seven minutes and whipped an effort just wide of the far upright. Osman was at the heart of most of Everton's promising attacks as playmaker Ross Barkley struggled to get into the game and the Everton stalwart found Romelu Lukaku with a splendid through ball on 13 minutes but Costel Pantilimon was alert to the danger to race off his line and make a last-ditch tackle. Pantilimon was to the rescue again on 41 minutes, this time closing down Lukaku on the edge of his six-yard box after a nice change of pace from the front man. Sunderland failed to clear the danger and Osman should have done better from the edge of the box but fired straight at the visitors' ‘keeper, who gave a roar of appreciation at his efforts. Sunderland had offered little as an attacking force in the opening period but opened the scoring nine minutes into the second half. Gomez took aim from 20 yards and his strike was heading off target until it hit the inside of Graham’s left leg, looped up over Tim Howard and nestled in the net off the right-hand post. Everton kept on coming after going behind but a mixture of poor decision-making by their forwards and some brave last-ditch defending by the visitors kept Sunderland’s noses in front. Such was Everton’s wastefulness, Sunderland full-back Patrick van Aanholt actually created one of the better chances of the half with a mesmerising individual run on 62 minutes that took him one-one-one with Howard but he blasted wide from a tight angle. Everton continued to press and win corner after corner but the ball just wouldn’t drop for them in the area. Lukaku fired wide from 10 yards before McCarthy came closest with a crisp drive from 15 yards that rocketed back off the post. Just as the Everton fans were strapping themselves in for a grandstand finish, Sunderland performed a second perfect classic smash-and-grab raid. After soaking up the pressure, they hit the hosts on the counter with substitute Adam Johnson firing a shot from a tight angle that took a deflection off Seamus Coleman’s hip, flew across the face of the goal and Defoe was on hand inside the six-yard box to force the ball home.

Cleverley’s close-range finish just after the half-hour mark thanks to fine play by Jack Grealish gave Villa the three points, as the hosts came through a nervy second half that lacked chances for both sides. The result leaves Villa four points above the drop zone with two games remaining, and marked their first back-to-back home wins of the season.

Charles N’Zogbia’s goal-bound effort from 12 yards was blocked well by Kevin Nolan, before Adrian parried a Fabian Delph effort away from danger. Christian Benteke failed to connect well enough on the turn from a Jores Okore’s header, while Cleverley forced another save out of Adrian with a volley from the right corner of the penalty area. But the on-loan Manchester United midfielder earned his third goal in three games on 31 minutes, largely thanks to youngster Grealish’s fine wing play. Collecting N’Zogbia’s pass, the 19-year-old barged his way to the byline, before finding Cleverley with a fine cut-back for the midfielder to turn home from three yards. West Ham brought Nene and Alex Song on at half-time, and the former’s effort from the edge of the box fizzed just over Given’s bar a minute after the restart. Given then tipped over James Collins’ header from a corner, as the prospect of a third win in four games created a nervous atmosphere at Villa Park.

was relegated despite victory at Hull Burnley will be playing Championship football next season, despite winning 1-0 at Hull thanks to a second-half goal from Danny Ings. Results elsewhere sealed Burnley's fate and the afternoon’s action may also have terrible consequences for Hull, who now find themselves two points from safety, with a pair of tough fixtures left to play. The hosts could have few complaints after a somewhat insipid display considering the magnitude of the occasion, although they will count themselves unfortunate that the luckless Robbie Brady twice hit the bar with fine free-kicks. Burnley prevailed at Hull - but the win was not enough to keep them up Chances were few and far during a nervy opening 20 minutes at the KC Stadium, but things picked up when Brady produced a lovely cross from the left and Ahmed Elmohamady headed over the bar at the back post in a promising position. Brady was easily Hull’s best performer in the opening half and he then sent over a corner which was glanced narrowly over the bar by a combination of Paul McShane and Dame N’Doye. Ashley Barnes had a pair of opportunities at the other end either side of that Hull chance, nodding a David Jones corner over the bar under pressure from a defender before drawing a decent save from Steve Harper with a downward header from Matty Taylor's cross. Hull City manager Steve Bruce was left frustrated with his side's performance after they lost to Burnley. Hull City manager Steve Bruce was left frustrated with his side's performance after they lost to Burnley. Brady was then extremely unlucky not to put Hull in front, whipping a delightful left-footed free-kick over the defensive wall, but looked on in despair as it hit the top of the bar and stayed out. Burnley needed a win to have any hope of avoiding relegation and were the better side at the start of the second-half; Barnes failing to get enough on a delightful Taylor cross and glancing a lunging header well wide. An inspired Ings then charged into the penalty area and appeared to be tripped as a pair of defenders converged on him, but referee Martin Atkinson declined to point to the spot. However, the visitors got the breakthrough on the 62nd-minute corner with Hull defender Michael Dawson on the sidelines having been sent to get treatment as blood was coming from his nose. Burnley profited from Dawson's absence when Ben Mee sent the ball back into the box following Elmohamady’s attempted clearing header and Ings reacted superbly, turning sharply and firing the ball into the net from the edge of the six-yard box. Hull responded and sub Abel Hernandez drew a save from Tom Heaton with a clever back-heel from close range, while Barnes had a goal disallowed at the other end for barging into Harper. Brady then produced another glorious free-kick and this one was even closer, crashing against the angle of post and bar before bouncing away. Burnley manager Sean Dyche was full of praise for his players and the fans after his side were relegated from the Premier League. Burnley manager Sean Dyche was full of praise for his players and the fans after his side were relegated from the Premier League. Hull then piled forward in the closing stages but struggled to create chances against a packed Burnley defence. A Tom Huddlestone cross looked set to sneak into the corner of the net but Heaton threw up a hand at the last moment to parry the ball clear. But the efforts of Ings and Heaton were not enough to save the Clarets from dropping back down to the Championship. As for Hull, they now face a daunting trip to Tottenham before hosting Manchester United, and will need to pull off a shock in one of those fixtures if they are not to follow Burnley into the second tier. Soccer Saturday verdict – Paul Merson: After Burnley were relegated from the Premier League, Paul Merson felt Sean Dyche and his side had still overachieved considering the money they had spent After Burnley were relegated from the Premier League, Paul Merson felt Sean Dyche and his side had still overachieved considering the money they had spent “Burnley defended so well. The two at the back, Shackell and Duff, headed everything out of the box. If they had defended like that every week, I think they would have been all right. “It was a good finish from Danny Ings and I am sure he will be playing for someone in the Premier League next season. I also thought he should have had a penalty and so, even though Hull dominated, Burnley won 1-0 and could have had a penalty, so it was not a snatch-and-grab. Burnley gave as good as they got. “Hull will be kicking themselves. I think they are in big trouble now, that was a shocking result. But Tottenham were terrible today, so who is to say they cannot go there and win?” Player ratings: Hull: Harper (7), Chester (6), Dawson (6), McShane (6), Elmohamady (7), Huddlestone (6), Livermore

bolstered their survival hopes with 2-0 win over Southampton - their sixth victory in seven games. Mahrez scored after just seven minutes with a low shot from the edge of the box and added a second 12 minutes later after an error by Saints goalkeeper Paulo Gazzaniga. The three points were especially important after Sunderland's win at Everton earlier in the day had left Nigel Pearson's team outside of the relegation zone on goal difference alone. Mahrez, who came close to completing a hat-trick in the second half, will get the plaudits but this was a victory built on hard work and intensity by the entire Leicester side and in particular their forwards Jamie Vardy and Leonardo Ulloa. Leicester City manager Nigel Pearson was happy with his side's 2-0 win Leicester City manager Nigel Pearson was happy with his side's 2-0 win Both players covered mile after mile in attacking and defensive situations, pressing the Southampton defence in the early stages of the game and then dropping back to assist their own backline as the match went on. Tactically, Pearson was spot on. His team allowed Southampton to have the ball in their own half and in wide areas, knowing any long passes into the box would be easily consumed by his giant back three of Wes Morgan, Robert Huth and Marcin Wasilewski. Huth in particular made several vital headers as the visitors, who remain seventh in the Premier League table, were kept at arm's length. They can have no complaints about the result. Only in the final stages did they produce any attacking football of real quality but by then the game was won. Ronald Koeman admitted confidence is low in his Southampton team. Ronald Koeman admitted confidence is low in his Southampton team. Their best chance came in the 71st minute when Sadio Mane struck a looping shot which briefly had Kasper Schmeichel worried but which he pushed over his bar with a degree of comfort. Results elswhere mean that Burnley have been relegated from the Premier League, taking one of the places which seemed destined to go to Leicester for so long considering they were bottom for four months. They have almost doubled their points total in the past month and, given that form, now have a strong chance of staying in the division. Soccer Saturday analysis - Charlie Nicholas Charlie Nicholas was critical of Southampton's performance Charlie Nicholas was critical of Southampton's performance \"We know Leicester like to play into the wider areas, a bit of pace. Nigel Pearson has manoeuvred Vardy back into a position that suits his strikers. They threatened in behind the defenders more. He’s pulled another one out the bag today because Mahrez has been on the bench for a few matches now, but he comes on today and scores the two goals. \"The back three were so solid; Schmeichel for me gets better and better.

Ayoze Perez scored Newcastle's equalising goal in the 41st minute after Victor Anichebe had headed West Brom in front just past the half hour. The home side pushed hard for a winner in the second half but lacked any real cutting edge as Tony Pulis' men held on and almost snatched a winner themselves through Chris Brunt's late effort. For a game of such importance it was a rather low-key opening to the first half with neither side really asserting themselves. Newcastle were the side who finally attempted to take control of the game but it was West Brom who came closest to an early breakthrough. Craig Gardner swung in a corner from the left and Craig Dawson jumped highest to glance it goalwards, only to see it come back off the post. From that point they rarely ventured into Newcastle territory until they took the lead just past the half hour. Gardner put a free-kick in from the right and Anichebe nodded it past Tim Krul at the near post. Tony Pulis says he’s delighted that West Brom’s 1-1 draw away at Newcastle makes them mathematically safe in the Premier League. Tony Pulis says he’s delighted that West Brom’s 1-1 draw away at Newcastle makes them mathematically safe in the Premier League. It came barely a minute after Moussa Sissoko had seen his shot cleared off the line after Fabricio Coloccini had headed a free-kick back across goal. The midfielder got a bit of luck as he broke through a challenge before beating Myhill, only to see Joleon Lescott clear it off the line. The equaliser also came from a free-kick. Ryan Taylor crossed low from the left and Ayoze Perez controlled it well before firing left-footed into the bottom corner. Newcastle started the second period brighter but struggled to create any chances of note as West Brom continued to invite them forward. Remy Cabella, who had looked the most likely to make something happen for Newcastle before the break, became a more peripheral figure. The game became more stretched and tempers were frayed with John Carver venting his frustration at the match officials after a throw-in went against his side. He was up in arms a few moments later when substitute Papiss Cisse was adjudged to have fouled Lescott. His mood could have darkened further had West Brom taken their chances from the resulting free-kick. Following a turbulent week at Newcastle, John Carver says he’s learnt that the best talking is done on the pitch after witnessing a spirited performance fr Following a turbulent week at Newcastle, John Carver says he’s learnt that the best talking is done on the pitch after witnessing a spirited performance fr Lescott played it long towards Anichebe before the bouncing ball fell to Dawson, he lifted it to the far post where Brunt met it with a firm header. A despairing block on the line from Paul Dummett kept it out but the ball looped up and a combination of Brunt and Saido Berahino tried to force it over the line, succeeding only in sending it against the post under pressure from Krul. Berahino got through on goal soon afterwards but was denied by Krul. Newcastle were restricted to speculative efforts in the closing stages with Cabella shooting just off target from 20 yards and Sammy Ameobi's overhead kick going narrowly over the crossbar as time ran out. Having been in the top half as recently as January, Newcastle now find themselves just two points above the drop zone with just two games remaining.

Charlie Adam’s header put the hosts ahead before Steven N’Zonzi capitalised on a defensive mix-up to give Stoke a two-goal lead at the break. Vlad Chiriches was then dismissed for a second yellow card and Mame Biram Diouf wrapped up the result late on. Jack Butland turned Marc Muniesa’s header on to the crossbar, while Adam was denied a second goal after a good save by Hugo Lloris and Jonathan Walters missed a glorious chance. Stoke have now matched their final points tally of 50 from last season with two games to spare, while Spurs are seven points behind fourth place with only two of their fixtures remaining.

Mark Hughes claims his Stoke City side put in a performance worthy of a top-half team in their 3-0 win over Tottenham. Mark Hughes’ men started far stronger and almost took the lead inside four minutes when Marc Muniesa fired a stunning volley from the edge of the box, prompting Hugo Lloris into a fingertip save. The hosts continued to control proceedings with Spurs’ forwards denied any space on the ball by some impressive pressing by the Stoke midfield and defence. Marko Arnautovic was having plenty of joy down the left for Stoke, and he had a good chance saved as his drilled effort from 20 yards was saved by Lloris. But Stoke got the lead they deserved in the 21st minute. Mame Biram Diouf collected the ball on the right and whipped in an excellent cross, which was unwittingly flicked on by Jan Vertonghen for Adam to head in at the far post. Spurs were almost level within minutes as Erik Lamela's floated free-kick was headed toward his own goal by Muniesa, Butland producing an excellent to stop to prevent an own-goal. The hosts were still the better side, though, and on 32 minutes they profited from a defensive error to make it 2-0. Lloris and Eric Dier both went for Adam’s high ball into the area, and it came off the goalkeeper before landing for Nzonzi, who fired the ball low into the net with a good finish from a tight angle. The game went from bad to worse for Spurs at the start of the second half after Chiriches – who had already been booked – hauled down Diouf on 51 minutes to pick up a second booking and leave the visitors a man short. Adam soon took the advantage of the extra space, striding past two players before racing into the box and curling a low effort across goal, forcing a fine save from Lloris.

Mauricio Pochettino says his Spurs side must improve a lot if they are to finish in the top six following their 3-0 defeat to Stoke. Tottenham introduced Roberto Soldado to give the isolated Harry Kane support up front, but Stoke’s organisation and pressing meant the visitors still struggled to fashion any clear-cut chances. It should have been 3-0 when substitute Stephen Ireland played the ball out to the left for Ryan Shawcross, whose low cross was met by Walters, but the Republic of Ireland international could only fire straight at Lloris from point-blank range. At the other end, Christian Eriksen went close with a 30-yard free kick which whistled just over the crossbar but the result was put beyond doubt with four minutes left as Arnautovic again picked the ball up on the left-hand side, and his low ball was turned in at the near post by Diouf.

"Thierry Henry and Jamie Redknapp look at the vital saves from David de Gea Thierry Henry and Jamie Redknapp look at the vital saves from David de Gea Manchester United ended a run of three consecutive defeats and put themselves on the brink of Champions League qualification with a hard-fought 2-1 win over Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park on Saturday Night Football. Marouane Fellaini capitalised on a mistake from Julian Speroni to score the winner 12 minutes from full-time after Jason Puncheon had cancelled out Juan Mata’s first-half penalty with a well-executed free-kick. The victory moved United seven points clear of fifth-placed Liverpool in the Premier League table, meaning that if Brendan Rodgers’ side lose to Chelsea on Sunday, Louis van Gaal’s team will be guaranteed a place in the top four. Louis van Gaal was delighted with his side’s 2-1 win away to Crystal Palace Louis van Gaal was delighted with his side’s 2-1 win away to Crystal Palace Palace went into the game knowing they were mathematically safe from relegation thanks to results elsewhere earlier in the day but fell to a fourth defeat in a row, despite a spirited second-half fightback. The hosts started quickly but United soon began to control possession and almost went ahead when Daley Blind saw a goal-bound 25-yard left-footer turned around the post by Julian Speroni. They continued to ramp up the pressure and after Ander Herrera had also flashed a long-range shot wide, they finally made the breakthrough, in the 19th minute, when Scott Dann blocked Ashley Young’s left-wing cross with his arm and Mata stroked home the resulting penalty. Herrara could have made it 2-0 three minutes later but scooped a half-volley over from 10 yards after a nod down from Marouane Fellaini. Juan Mata opened the scoring from the penalty spot Palace threatened only sporadically from set pieces and counter-attacks down the wings, but they should have equalised when Mile Jedinak met a corner from the right after 26 minutes, only to steer his header high and wide. Manager Alan Pardew replaced Joe Ledley with Jason Puncheon at half-time and they were a different team in the second period as the extra attacker and a more urgent pressing game saw them wrestle control of the game from United. Crystal Palace said he was delighted with how his players performed and felt they deserved more from their 1-2 defeat to Manchester United. Crystal Palace said he was delighted with how his players performed and felt they deserved more from their 1-2 defeat to Manchester United. Glenn Murray hit the side-netting with a deft flick after 50 minutes and Puncheon had a credible claim for a penalty turned down four minutes later, but they were finally rewarded for their vast improvement in the 57th minute. Murray won a free-kick from Chris Smalling on the left edge of the box and Puncheon punished United with a beautifully measured strike, although Blind in the wall was guilty of allowing the ball to fly over his head too easily. United regained some control around the hour mark but Palace continued to create chances at will and after James McArthur had curled a shot wide, both Murray and Wilfried Zaha were denied by fine stops from the excellent David De Gea. United were also threatening as the game became an end-to-end duel, and it was the visitors who snatched the inevitable winning goal. The outstanding Ashley Young crossed the from the left and the flight of the ball deceived Speroni, allowing Fellaini to nod home the winner into an empty net at the back post. There was a setback earlier in the game for United when Wayne Rooney, who started as a lone striker, had to be replaced at half-time by Radamel Falcao with what appeared to be a dead leg.

Two Sanchez strikes and an Aaron Ramsey goal put the visitors firmly in control in the first half, before Stephen Quinn gave Hull hope on 56 minutes, but the Gunners held on. Arsenal are now unbeaten in 10 games and, still with a game in hand, they have equalled City’s 70 points, albeit with an inferior goal difference. The win also secured Arsene Wenger's side a place in the Champions League for the 18th successive season. Hull remain level on points and goal difference with Leicester in the battle for Premier League survival, but have dropped beneath them having scored fewer goals. Sanchez, who has now scored in all three meetings with Hull this season, pick-pocketed Tom Huddlestone in midfield after 28 minutes to instigate the opener. Jake Livermore brought him down to prevent an ominous dribble towards goal, but Sanchez’s 25-yard free-kick sailed past a helpless Steve Harper, via a fortuitous deflection off Michael Dawson. Steve Bruce: Upbeat despite Hull's 3-1 defeat Steve Bruce: Upbeat despite Hull's 3-1 defeat Five minutes later, Santi Cazorla pinged a missile of a pass with his left foot from the half-way line, picking out the onrushing Ramsey perfectly. The Welshman, who had seemed certain to be substituted earlier after an ankle injury, controlled it and beat Harper with another deflection benefitting the visitors. While Hull had their moments in the first half – Sone Aluko sent a feeble header off target from a few yards out after Robbie Brady’s left-wing cross – Arsenal put the game beyond them before the interval. Sanchez had been denied by Harper after Cazorla sent him scurrying through on goal but, presented with an identical chance seconds later, he wouldn’t miss again. Ramsey played in Sanchez, who rounded the goalkeeper for his side’s third. Quinn, who had threatened with a first-half header, gave Hull hope by converting a similar chance on 56 minutes. Huddlestone centred the ball and the Irishman scored his first Premier League goal in eight years. Although Hull rallied admirably following their goal, Arsenal continued to illuminate the match with some stunning interchange in the final third. One such move was highlighted by a quite remarkable back-heeled volley by Mesut Ozil which set up a dangerous Sanchez move down the left. Arsene Wenger: Feeling optimistic about next season Arsene Wenger: Feeling optimistic about next season Jack Wilshere’s return as a 68th minute substitute in place of Ramsey was another major positive for Arsene Wenger ahead of the final three games of the season. His first involvement was a trademark burst out of midfield to win a free-kick but although the manner of his acceleration evoked memories of old, his fall was worrying until he immediately climbed to his feet. Wilshere nearly crowned his return with a goal when Hector Bellerin’s initial shot was kept out by Harper and his close-range rebound was kept out by James Chester. As Wilshere appealed for handball, Sanchez bundled the loose ball wide. Gary Neville was impressed with Santi Cazorla, who put in a man of the match performance in Arsenal's 3-1 win against Hull Gary Neville was impressed with Santi Cazorla, who put in a man of the match performance in Arsenal's 3-1 win against Hull The England midfielder continued his impressive cameo with a quick dash down the right wing that may have resulted in a penalty after he fell under Chester’s challenge. A fellow England international returning from a serious injury, Theo Walcott, only got four minutes but a side-footed effort drifted wide before Sanchez's hopes for a hat-trick evaporated when he shot wide as Arsenal counter-attacked in stoppage time. Arsenal have now won 18 of their past 21 games, and host Swansea next as they aim to take advantage of their extra match over City.

The Blues needed one more victory to ensure they could wrestle the league crown away from the Manchester stronghold, and Eden Hazard's header - on the rebound after a spurned first-half penalty - was enough to settle a cagey affair. Terry's post-match reaction Terry's post-match reaction Palace were no pushovers and had several half-chances to get themselves back into the match but it was Chelsea's day, Manchester City dethroned with three games to spare. Jose Mourinho has now taken his career haul to 22 trophies - this his third league triumph with Chelsea - but he watched Alan Pardew's men start the match with real gusto, determined to spoil the Blues’ big day. Watch the Chelsea celebrations Watch the Chelsea celebrations Chelsea midfielder Ramires was forced to go to hospital and was replaced by Juan Cuadrado in the starting line up, with Mourinho saying after the game: \"Ramires went to hospital because he was feeling so bad.\" Wilfried Zaha was causing Branislav Ivanovic all sorts of problems down the left flank, but his final ball deserted him when it mattered most. More Chelsea reaction More Chelsea reaction Jason Puncheon had a great chance to break the deadlock, but his fierce effort from the edge of the box was blocked at the last by John Terry, with cries for handball falling on deaf ears. Chelsea struggled to get going, but it was their talisman Hazard who earned his side a glorious chance to take the lead on the stroke of half time, drawing a foul from James McArthur in the box, even though there was debate about the extent of the contact. Tunnel Talk: Patrick Davison with Martin Tyler Tunnel Talk: Patrick Davison with Martin Tyler Hazard stepped up himself, but his laid back penalty-taking style let him down, Speroni standing firm to keep the ball out. The PFA Player of the Year remained unfazed, though, and headed in the loose ball on the stroke of half-time to move the Blues another step closer to the title with games to spare. Pardew hails Palace Pardew hails Palace After the break, Chelsea were content to keep the ball and run down the clock, but Palace refused to give up. Puncheon fired just wide with Thibaut Courtois beaten, while the Belgian stopper was out quickly to smother at the feet of the dangerous Zaha. Mourinho's reaction Mourinho's reaction Didier Drogba did well to create space for a strike at goal in the box, but he scuffed his effort just wide with the goal gaping. Willian also fired wide with Speroni beaten, and that elusive second goal meant it was anxious final ten minutes at the Bridge. Palace pressed right to the end but Chelsea - with John Obi Mikel and Kurt Zouma called upon as late defensive reinforcements - held on and jubilant celebrations began.

First, Eric Dier glanced a free header wide from a corner, before Kane pulled his effort from the edge of the box after some slack City defending. The visitors were denied a penalty later in the half after Aguero fell inside the area under the attention of Federico Fazio having gone through on an open goal after Hugo Lloris’ slip. Referee Andre Marriner waved play on, but replays showed the Argentine’s heels were clipped by the Spurs defender just inside the box. Danny Rose: Spurs worth at least a point Danny Rose: Spurs worth at least a point However, Aguero got his 22nd league goal of the season moments later from a swift break, slamming home eight yards out past Lloris at the near post after David Silva’s cutting ball. City nearly went 2-0 up shortly after, but Fernandinho’s low driven effort from the edge of the box was deflected just wide of the Spurs goal by Danny Rose. Spurs had the chance to level on the stroke of half time, Mason seeing his effort on the turn saved well by Joe Hart after Kane’s fine lofted ball. Mauricio Pochettino: Praised his side's performance Mauricio Pochettino: Praised his side's performance Kane went close to equalising just after the hour after Martin Demichelis misjudged a back-pass, though the England striker’s effort after twisting in the area was saved at his feet by Hart. City went up the other end looking to double their lead, Aguero failing to finish from an angle having rounded Lloris after a superb one-two with Fernandinho. Manuel Pellegrini: Refused to be drawn on his future Manuel Pellegrini: Refused to be drawn on his future Spurs had a host of chances in the final 10 minutes; substitute Roberto Soldado saw his effort superbly blocked by Aleksandar Kolarov, Paulinho had a low drive parried by Hart, and Hart again denied Lamela’s acrobatic effort in injury time. City are now nine points above fifth place Liverpool with three games remaining, and it would take three defeats and a 24-goal swing for them to fall out of the top four.

"Leonardo Ulloa: Celebrates opening the scoring against Newcastle Leicester City recorded their biggest win of the season to move further away from the relegation zone but dragged crisis club Newcastle deeper into trouble with a 3-0 win at the King Power Stadium. Leonardo Ulloa struck twice and Wes Morgan was also on target as the Foxes maintained their survival charge against a freefalling and disjointed Magpies side, who finished with nine men after Mike Williamson and Daryl Janmaat saw red. Newcastle manager John Carver accuses Mike Williamson of deliberately getting sent off and questions the desire of his players Newcastle manager John Carver accuses Mike Williamson of deliberately getting sent off and questions the desire of his players John Carver’s men have now lost their last eight Premier League encounters in a row to remain in peril, still five points from safety, but with now only three games left to play this season. Nigel Pearson's side shrugged off a midweek defeat to Chelsea - as well as their manager's now-infamous 'ostrich' rant at a journalist - to record a fourth win in five but Sunderland's victory over Southampton means they remain just a point above the Wearsiders. Leonardo Ulloa heads Leicester City 1-0 up in the first minute The Foxes were on the front foot from the off, immediately earning a corner from which Ulloa rose highest at the near post, powering Marc Albrighton’s inch-perfect left-wing delivery past a helpless Tim Krul with just 37 seconds on the clock. And it did not take Leicester long to move further ahead, Albrighton again the provider with another dangerous delivery from the left which Morgan, just onside, stretched to get a touch past Krul (17). Wes Morgan scores for Leicester from close range The Magpies were toothless in attack in the opening period, the closest they came to testing Leicester goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel being Emmanuel Riviere’s clever turn and shot from the left-hand corner of the box that flew inches past the Dane’s near post. But whatever words Carver had for his bedraggled players at the break – and they must have been strong ones – were forgotten three minutes into the second half when Riviere clumsily pushed Marcin Wasilewski in the box following another dangerous looking Albrighton corner, referee Mike Dean having little option but to point to the spot. Wes Morgan and Esteban Cambiasso celebrate following Leicester's second goal against Newcastle Ulloa kept his cool to thump the resultant penalty high past Krul, and when the experienced Williamson proceeded to pick up two bookings in the space of a little over five minutes, Newcastle heads began to drop. The visitors were fortunate, though, that Pearson opted to rest some of his key men in the closing stages otherwise they could have suffered an even heavier defeat, but their goal difference is now the second worst in the top flight. Schmeichel was called upon late on to save from Siem de Jong but Newcastle went down with a whimper and were spared further blushes when Jamie Vardy headed wide in injury time. But there was more misery before the whistle when Janmaat received his marching orders in second-half stoppage time after picking up a needless second booking, the Dutchman - like Williamson - now suspended for next week's visit of West Brom.

"Aston Villa 3-2 Everton: Christian Benteke scores twice in vital win in battle for survival Christian Benteke's first-half double helped Aston Villa boost their chances of Premier League survival with a 3-2 home win over Everton. Benteke's 10th-minute header gave Villa the lead on Saturday, before the Belgian scored his 12th goal in 11 games with a far-post finish before the break. Aston Villa midfielder Fabian Delph was full of praise for his in-form teammate Christian Benteke Aston Villa midfielder Fabian Delph was full of praise for his in-form teammate Christian Benteke Everton halved the deficit in the second half through Romelu Lukaku's penalty, but Villa regained their two-goal lead five minutes later through Tom Cleverley's neat finish. Phil Jagielka's header in stoppage time made it 3-2, but Villa held on and the result keeps them two points clear of the drop zone with three games remaining. After Leicester's 3-0 win over Newcastle earlier in the day, Villa were under pressure to earn a positive result, and they duly started the brighter. Aston Villa manager Tim Sherwood was thrilled with their 3-2 win Aston Villa manager Tim Sherwood was thrilled with their 3-2 win Tim Sherwood's side were ahead after just 10 minutes, Benteke rising high above Leighton Baines to connect with Fabian Delph's deep cross from six yards. They were nearly 2-0 up from another set piece, but unmarked Ron Vlaar's header from close range went just wide of Tim Howard’s goal. But Villa did double their lead just before half-time, as Jack Grealish's dangerous corner evaded Vlaar but was met by Benteke at the far post to slide home from a couple of yards. Everton improved after half-time, and earned a penalty after some poor defending from Villa resulted in Vlaar bringing down Steven Naismith. Lukaku rolled the ball just beyond Shay Given for 2-1, but moments later Villa scored against the run of play. After being put through on goal by a fine through ball from Leandro Bacuna, Cleverley struck the ball high past Howard for his second goal in two games (64). Everton captain Phil Jagielka wants to 'put the result to bed' as quickly as possible Everton captain Phil Jagielka wants to 'put the result to bed' as quickly as possible Villa had most of the play for the remaining 25 minutes, but Everton made for a nervy last two as Jagielka nodded the ball over the line after a melee- despite Shay Given's appeals for a foul in the six-yard box. Sherwood's Villa held on for his fourth Premier League win as manager, but results elsewhere mean the hosts are still in a battle for survival.

For me they have an all-round balance. They have energy, desire, positive passing and running, it was all there today. Villa were more than worthy of the three points and they looked a really good side today. \"Delph was absolutely magical today, Westwood sat in front of the back allowed Delph and Cleverley to go show their energy.

2-1 victory at Anfield. On his penultimate appearance at Anfield, Gerrard missed the penalty that would have restored the hosts' lead after Leroy Fer's volley had cancelled out Philippe Coutinho's first-half goal. Steven Gerrard: Delighted to score winner after missing penalty Steven Gerrard: Delighted to score winner after missing penalty But he showed a enduring knack for picking the moment when he pounced three minutes from time. Defeat leaves QPR - who had Nedum Onouha sent off for two bookable offences within the space of four minutes, seven points from safety with just nine to play for and Manchester City up next. Liverpool close the gap on Manchester United to four points in the race for Champions League qualification but some supporters made feelings known; a plane trailed a 'Rodgers out, Rafa (Benitez) in' banner across Anfield before kick-off. Brendan Rodgers admitted his Liverpool side made hard work of their 2-1 victory over QPR Brendan Rodgers admitted his Liverpool side made hard work of their 2-1 victory over QPR There was a sombre atmosphere around Anfield before kick-off, though, after the news of the death of QPR defender Rio Ferdinand’s wife, Rebecca, and Liverpool paid their respects before the game as Gerrard handed Joey Barton a bouquet of flowers to pass onto Ferdinand. The visitors, who wore black armbands, thought they had the lead just seconds into the game as Fer bundled home Matt Phillips’ corner, only to the see the linesman flag for a goal-kick after the ball went out of play. It took Liverpool until the 16th minute to have their first attempt on goal and it was Rickie Lambert, making his first start in the Premier League since December 6th, who had it, cutting inside on his right foot before firing a shot straight at Green. Despite QPR’s promising start, it was Liverpool who took the lead as Lambert picked out Coutinho with a pass from the right wing and the Brazilian took one touch, before curling the ball beyond Green and into the top corner (19). Liverpool were finishing the half the stronger and they thought they should have had a penalty when Raheem Sterling’s cross appeared to hit Clint Hill’s arm, but referee Martin Atkinson remained unmoved. QPR manager Chris Ramsey was frustrated to concede a late Steven Gerrard penalty QPR manager Chris Ramsey was frustrated to concede a late Steven Gerrard penalty Rodgers’ side had one final chance to double their advantage just before the break as Gerrard fired a free-kick goalwards but Green moved to his right well to make a smart save. QPR boss Chris Ramsey was forced into a change at half-time with Yun Suk-young replacing the injured Steven Caulker, but it failed to stem Liverpool’s attacking threat. Adam Lallana was the first to go close as he dragged his shot wide before Sterling missed a glorious chance at the far post after Jordan Henderson’s brilliant cross. The hosts looked like they had paid the price for not taking their chances when Fer's strike gave QPR hope of a point with 17 minutes remaining, but Gerrard eventually got them out of trouble. The Liverpool skipper was handed his first chance to win the game in the 80th minute as Onuoha bundled Skrtel to the floor in the box, but, from 12 yards, Green was Gerrard’s nemesis again. Minutes later, Onuoha - who was booked for the foul on Skrtel - received a second yellow card after a late challenge on Jordan Ibe, and with just three minutes remaining, Gerrard made up for his penalty miss to head home Coutinho’s corner. Anfield rose as one as the 34-year-old was substituted soon after to hail another matchwinning performance, Liverpool still just in the hunt with three games remaining but QPR's fate at the other end all-but sealed.

Southampton had James Ward-Prowse sent off for his part in the second penalty incident but almost snatched a point with the last kick of the game, only for Costel Pantilimon to save Sunderland with a great save from sub Steven Davis. Sunderland remain in the drop zone, Leicester having won earlier in the day, but the Black Cats are only a point from safety and have a game on most of their rivals, so hope is very much alive on Wearside. Jordi Gomez: Delighted Sunderland picked up the points Jordi Gomez: Delighted Sunderland picked up the points The first game between these two clubs this season was won 8-0 by Southampton but a repeat never looked on the cards, Sunderland going about their work with a lot more vigour on this occasion. Danny Graham was recalled in attack by the boss Dick Advocaat and he was off-target with an early half-chance after latching onto a neat pass from Billy Jones. And the hosts took the lead in the 21st minute when Saints defender Maya Yoshida could only head a speculative long pass up into the air and Jose Fonte then sent Graham to the turf with a recklessly high challenge. Gomez calmly tucked the spot-kick into the corner of the net but the hosts then handed Southampton an equaliser just a minute later. Dick Advocaat said he was proud of Sunderland's 2-1 win Dick Advocaat said he was proud of Sunderland's 2-1 win Fonte’s punt forward did not look very dangerous but there was a mix-up at the back and after Pantilimon spilled the ball following a collision with Sebastian Coates, Sadio Mane was happy to sweep the ball into the unguarded net. Undeterred by the concession of such a soft leveller, Sunderland pushed forward, eager to regain the initiative, and Jermain Defoe blazed over, while Graziano Pelle headed off-target at the other end. Connor Wickham then squandered a fantastic chance, side-footing over the top after marauding full-back Patrick van Aanholt had picked him out with a fine low cross. There was more frustration for Sunderland before half-time as Kelvin Davis in the Southampton goal kept the scores level, scrambling across his goal to keep out a close-range Defoe header with a fine one-handed save, and then parrying away a Sebastian Larsson free-kick. But the hosts started the second-half in lively fashion and the turning point of the match went their way 10 minutes after the break. Ronald Koeman was left frustrated with Southampton's performance Ronald Koeman was left frustrated with Southampton's performance Graham did really well in the box, eluding a challenge and then playing in Defoe, who was let down by his first touch but was felled by a clumsy Ward-Prowse challenge in any case. Referee Mike Jones pointed to the spot and, while that may well have been the right call, the Southampton players were stunned that he also reached for a straight red. Gomez was unbothered and having put his first spot-kick into the right-hand corner, he went to the left this time, successfully sending Davis the wrong way. Despite being down to 10 men, Southampton bossed the remaining half-hour or so but struggled to create chances against a packed home defence. Toby Alderweireld felt that James Ward-Prowse's red card was harsh on Southampton Toby Alderweireld felt that James Ward-Prowse's red card was harsh on Southampton Pelle appealed for a penalty when his shot seemed to hit Coates on the arm as the defender slid in to block but it would have been harsh and ref Jones was not interested. Southampton’s best chances came late on but Vergini did well to get in the way after his fellow sub Filip Djuricic had chested the ball down in the box. Vergini then blotted his copybook, giving the ball away in stoppage-time with a careless back-heel deep in his own territory but, when the cross came over, Pantilimon was on hand to deny Davis and Sunderland’s fans were able to breathe a huge sigh of relief. Soccer Saturday verdict – Paul Merson Paul Merson: Referee made two key decisions which determined the outcome of the game Paul Merson: Referee made two key decisions which determined the outcome of the game “The first one is definitely a penalty; he’s kicked his head quite high. Literally a minute later, Fonte lumps a hopeful ball into the box. Pantilimon comes to collect it and his own player completely takes him out. \"After that, there wasn’t a lot in it. Southampton weren’t their fluent selves and obviously, Sunderland were nervous towards the end, because it was a very, very big win. The second penalty is touch and go – probably a penalty but not a sending off, so the ref wasn’t that bad. “Sunderland have got to play tough teams.

the Liberty Stadium. Goals from Jefferson Montero and Ki Sung-yueng secured all three points for the Swans, while Marc Wilson was sent off late on for Stoke after receiving a second yellow card. Swansea City midfielders Jonjo Shelvey and Ki Sung-yueng were in good spirits following their 2-0 win against Stoke Swansea City midfielders Jonjo Shelvey and Ki Sung-yueng were in good spirits following their 2-0 win against Stoke It was a forgettable affair for long spells but the win solidifies Swansea’s hold on eighth spot as they move six points clear of Stoke in ninth, the Welsh club on course for their highest-ever Premier League finish. Poor execution in the final third was a feature of the first half as both teams struggled to break each other down. Swansea’s best move of the half came in the 42nd minute when Montero found the overlapping Neil Taylor down the left and the Welsh defender whipped in a cross which Dyer layed off to Shelvey on the edge of the box but his shot is straight at Butland. Garry Monk: Praised his side's second-half performance Garry Monk: Praised his side's second-half performance Stoke came very close to opening the scoring just before the break when Steven N'Zonzi neatly evaded Gylfi Sigurdsson’s tackle on the edge of the box before curling a shot towards the top corner which Lukasz Fabianski did well to tip over. Garry Monk must not have been impressed with his side’s first-half efforts because Swansea came out with much greater purpose for the second half. They almost took an immediate lead when Angel Rangel drove into the box from the right flank and laid the ball off to Sigurdsson but his curling shot from the edge of the box cannoned off the crossbar. Mark Hughes: Felt the scoreline was an unfair reflection of the game Mark Hughes: Felt the scoreline was an unfair reflection of the game Sigurdsson missed a gilt-edged opportunity moments later when Nathan Dyer made a driving run down the right and clipped a cross in from the byline which the Iceland international somehow managed to head over from six yards out when completely unmarked. Swansea continued to press and they finally made the breakthrough on 76 minutes thanks to some great play from Jonjo Shelvey. The former Liverpool man did well to keep the ball in down the right before stepping inside Erik Pieters and sending an inviting cross to the back post with his left foot which Montero was on hand to nod home. Stoke City captain Ryan Shawcross believes that their second-half performance cost them Stoke City captain Ryan Shawcross believes that their second-half performance cost them Peter Crouch and Peter Odenwingie were introduced for Stoke soon after as Mark Hughes’ side pushed for an equaliser. But they were made to pay by Swansea as they were caught high up the pitch and Wilson was forced to hack down Montero as he was through on goal to earn himself a second yellow. Swansea wrapped up all three points in added time when Shelvey found space in the inside left channel and laid the ball off for Ki to sidefoot past Jack Butland. Soccer Saturday verdict – Phil Thompson Phil Thompson: Swansea put in a much-improved performance in the second half Phil Thompson: Swansea put in a much-improved performance in the second half “First half wasn’t very good – both teams - there wasn’t a lot to shout about. It was a lot better in the second half. This Swansea team have got a lot of good players, Sigurdsson and Shelvey. It got going in the second half. This is 53 points for this team, for Garry Monk. It’s been a very, very good season. The first goal was brilliant, Jonjo Shelvey is the creative brilliance in this side. “It took until the 92nd minute before they wrapped it up. Ki is in great goalscoring form, and he just sidefooted it past Butland. “Jonjo Shelvey is learning to play. I think it was earlier in the season when Garry Monk had words with him, or told the media, and said he needs to grow up in a football sense. He seems to have taken that on; he was always trying a Hollywood ball, a 50-yard ball. He makes this team tick. “The second half just wasn’t enough from this Stoke side. They tried bringing Odemwingie on, Crouch came on, but it just wasn’t enough.” Player ratings Swansea: Fabianski (7), Rangel (7), Taylor (8), Williams (6), Fernandez (7), Cork (6), Shelvey (8),

No doubt about the turning point in the game, when Duff was harshly sent off after fouling Kouyate for a penalty in the first half, which was converted by Noble. Burnley are as good as down. WEST HAM 1-0 BURNLEY: Nene turns his man and fires one in from 25 yards, but Heaton tips it just over the bar. Yellow card for Mee. This time the Burnley defender definitely makes contact with Downing. 90' WEST HAM 1-0 BURNLEY: Kouyate's effort from the edge of the area beats Heaton but Burnley defender Shackell heads it off the line! 89' WEST HAM 1-0 BURNLEY: Nene drives forward but his cross towards Cole is intercepted by Burnley defender Shackell 88' WEST HAM 1-0 BURNLEY: The ball drops to Collins in the six-yard box, but the West Ham defender turns and blazes it over the bar. Should have done better. 87' WEST HAM 1-0 BURNLEY: Carlton Cole has a chance inside the Burnley area, but his effort is straight at Heaton Wallace booked for Burnley just a few minutes after coming on 83' WEST HAM 1-0 BURNLEY: Carlton Cole's first action of the game is heading just over from a Downing cross Allardyce makes his second substitution. Valencia off, Cole on Burnley make changes.Barnes and Taylor off, Wallace and Sordell on. WEST HAM 1-0 BURNLEY: 10 minutes to go at Upton Park. Can Burnley find their way back? Doesn't look too likely at the moment. West Ham make a chance. Captain Nolan off, Nene on 75' WEST HAM 1-0 BURNLEY: Burnley look increasingly tired as West Ham continue to play the possession game 73' WEST HAM 1-0 BURNLEY: Jenkinson again has the chance to cross from the right, but his delivery can't find a team-mate 70' WEST HAM 1-0 BURNLEY: Kouyate heads over the Burnley bar from a corner 69' WEST HAM 1-0 BURNLEY: Backs to the wall defending for Burnley at the moment... 68' WEST HAM 1-0 BURNLEY: Chance for Hammers teenager Burke, but his effort is blocked. 66' WEST HAM 1-0 BURNLEY: But it comes to nothing for the Clarets. Just a quarter of the game to go for the 10-man side to find a result 65' WEST HAM 1-0 BURNLEY: Burnley have a chance to whip in a corner after Taylor's cross was turned behind by Collins... 63' WEST HAM 1-0 BURNLEY: Kouyate is down after a nasty foul by Burnley midfielder Keane. He's luck to escape a caution there. 61' WEST HAM 1-0 BURNLEY: At first glance that looked a penalty to me, but the replay shows that Downing appeared to dive. Good decision from the referee there. 60' Downing booked for diving. The West Ham winger goes down in the box, but the referee is having none of it. 59' WEST HAM 1-0 BURNLEY: Real chance for West Ham! The ball drops to Nolan completely open 12 yards out, but his effort is straight at Heaton. Valencia's close-range effort is then blocked and the ball drifts just wide. 58' WEST HAM 1-0 BURNLEY: And then Adrian keeps it at 1-1! The West Ham keeper saves brilliantly with his legs from Taylor's low drive 57' WEST HAM 1-0 BURNLEY: Amalfitano has a great chance to make it two! Valencia wins the knockdown to Nolan, who flicks it through the legs of a Burnley defender, but Amalfitano's curling effort just goes wide of the post. 55' WEST HAM 1-0 BURNLEY: Jenkinson fires one across but Heaton cuts it out for Burnley before it can reach Valencia 54' WEST HAM 1-0 BURNLEY: Ings gets in behind again and is seemingly bundled over by Jenkinson on the edge of the area. Definitely a free-kick but referee Moss waves play on. 52' WEST HAM 1-0 BURNLEY: Ings controls a long ball brilliantly before cutting inside Cresswell, he then drives into the West Ham box and tries to beat Adrian at his near post, but can only find the side netting. 50' WEST HAM 1-0 BURNLEY: Valencia cuts inside and shoots for West Ham but his effort is off target 48' WEST HAM 1-0 BURNLEY: Kouyate fires one in from 25 yards out but his effort is deflected wide 47' WEST HAM 1-0 BURNLEY: Jenkinson drives a low cross in to team-mate Nolan, but the West Ham captain's flicked effort goes wide 46' WEST HAM 1-0 BURNLEY: We're back underway at Upton Park Boyd off, Keane on for Burnley before the start of the second half WEST HAM 1-0 BURNLEY: West Ham lead at the break through Noble's penalty after Kouyate was brought down by Duff. Was definitely a penalty but never a red card. Burnley need to turn this one around in the second-half or they're as good as down. 45+2 WEST HAM 1-0 BURNLEY: Cresswell fires an incredibly ambitious effort over from about 40 yards 45+1 WEST HAM 1-0 BURNLEY: Downing fires a cross in from the right but can't find a team-mate in the box Two added minutes at Upton Park at the end of the first-half 45' WEST HAM 1-0 BURNLEY: Trippier fires a 30-yard free-kick well over the bar of Adrian Noble booked for a foul on Arfield. Barely a free-kick, never a yellow. 43' WEST HAM 1-0 BURNLEY: Ings a little lucky to win a free-kick after losing the ball to Noble in his own half Valencia booked for West Ham 40' WEST HAM 1-0 BURNLEY: Downing gets down the right before clipping one in, but Trippier just takes the ball off the head of West Ham captain Nolan 39' WEST HAM 1-0 BURNLEY: Amalfitano whips one in from the right and Nolan gets his head to it but his effort can't test Heaton in the Burnley goal 37' WEST HAM 1-0 BURNLEY: West Ham are knocking the ball around at the back fairly comfortably at the moment, Burnley aren't really looking too threatening 35' WEST HAM 1-0 BURNLEY: Barnes tries to feed Ings in behind by West Ham defender Jenkinson covers back well before shepherding the ball out of play 33' WEST HAM 1-0 BURNLEY: Barnes comes close to equalising for Burnley, but his diving header from a corner is kept out well by Adrian. 32' WEST HAM 1-0 BURNLEY: Trippier wins a corner for Burnley... 31' WEST HAM 1-0 BURNLEY: It's confirmed that Duff was sent off for preventing a goal scoring opportunity. I still think it was really harsh. 29' WEST HAM 1-0 BURNLEY: Heaton in action again in the Burnley goal as he keeps out Amalfitano's strike at the near post 27' WEST HAM 1-0 BURNLEY: What a save from Heaton! He's kept Burnley in it here. Downing gets down the right and cuts it back to Valencia, who fires in from six yards but the keeper manages to get a strong hand to it and turn it over. WEST HAM 1-0 BURNLEY: Noble finds the bottom corner sending the keeper the wrong way. The Hammers lead! And Duff is sent off! Shocking. Definitely a penalty but never a red. 23' WEST HAM 0-0 BURNLEY: PENALTY TO WEST HAM! Kouyate brought down by Duff. 22' WEST HAM 0-0 BURNLEY: Trippier whips into the box but he can't find a Burnley team-mate 19' WEST HAM 0-0 BURNLEY: Great chance for Ings to end his barren run! Taylor whips in a pearler from the left and Ings has a free header from 10 yards out after losing his marker, but he fails to test Adrian as he nods it over the bar. 17' WEST HAM 0-0 BURNLEY: Good pressure from Burnley at the moment following a slow start 15' WEST HAM 0-0 BURNLEY: Taylor swings one in for Barnes, and it looks as though the Burnley forward has a free header on goal from six yards, but the ball drifts agonisingly over his head by inches and out for a West Ham goal kick 14' WEST HAM 0-0 BURNLEY: Ings then flashes one across the face of the West Ham goal, but he can't find a team-mate 13' WEST HAM 0-0 BURNLEY: Ings has an effort from 25 yards for Burnley, but his shot strikes team-mate Barnes. 12' WEST HAM 0-0 BURNLEY: A corner is whipped in for West Ham and it pinballs around in the area, but no one can get a decisive touch before it finds the arms of Heaton in goal for Burnley. 10' WEST HAM 0-0 BURNLEY: Valencia seems to be moving freely now as he charges about up front 9' WEST HAM 0-0 BURNLEY: Downing has a chance to cross but his effort is poor and it flies out for a goalkick 8' WEST HAM 0-0 BURNLEY: Slow start to the game here, the short injury break has really killed any potential momentum. Burnley haven't really got their foot on the ball yet. 6' WEST HAM 0-0 BURNLEY: Valencia doesn't look comfortable at all as he hobbles off the pitch. But he decides he's okay to continue before almost immediately hobbling back on 5' WEST HAM 0-0 BURNLEY: Valencia now looks in a little bit of trouble after appearing to twist his ankle. Currently having treatment on the pitch 3' WEST HAM 0-0 BURNLEY: Decent chance for West Ham and Valencia! Cresswell whips a beauty in from the left across the six-yard box, the Ecuadorian striker is nearest to it but he just can't quite make contact with the ball. Should have done better really. 2' WEST HAM 0-0 BURNLEY: Low key start at Upton Park. Nothing between the two sides in a cagey opening exchange at a subdued Upton Park 1' WEST HAM 0-0 BURNLEY: And we're underway! Allardyce looks pretty relaxed as he heads out himself. Will he still be in charge at the start of next season? Three points today would certainly help. The two teams are making their way out of the tunnel Just10 minutes until kick-off now at Upton Park And in that nine-game run, Burnley have failed to find the net in seven. Just two goals have come in that time, the first for a 1-1 draw at Chelsea, the second for a 1-0 win over Manchester City. Not too shabby in that sense. How Burnley could do with Danny Ings finding his form again today. While previously tipped for a move to one of the Premier League's big boys, the 23-year-old has now gone nine games without a goal. Paul Merson predicts West Ham to win 2-0: Burnley just don't seem to score goals - that's seven out of eight games they've failed to score, and you just can't do that. West Ham have to win a game sooner or later, and it should be this weekend. This really is make or break time now for Burnley. Sean Dyche's side currently sit bottom of the Premier League, and should results go against them today they could find themselves eight points from safety with just three games left to play. Not quite down, but pretty much as close as you can get. Fancy a flutter on this one? Then head on over to Sky Bet and have a look at some of the odds on offer. My tip is George Boyd to score first at 9/1 Alex Song is back on the bench for West Ham after missing the trip to QPR last week with a back problem 18-year-old Reece Burke retains his place in the West Ham starting XI after impressing during his debut last week. He has taken his chance in the injury absence of Winston Reid and James Tomkins. While Sean Dyche also makes just a single change from the side that were beaten 1-0 by Leicester last time out. Barnes comes in for Jutkiewicz Sam Allardyce makes just one change from the side who drew 0-0 at QPR last week. Amalfitano comes in to replace Jarvis.

penalty saved as Chris Brunt's deflected free kick gave West Brom a 1-0 win at Manchester United on Saturday Night Football. The midfielder’s second-half effort diverted in off Jonas Olsson and proved to be the winner in a game dominated by Louis van Gaal’s men, who have now lost three Premier League games in succession for the first time since 2001. Boaz Myhill made a string of good saves, while Van Persie saw his spot kick turned away by the West Brom goalkeeper after Saido Berahino was penalised for handball. The hosts enjoyed huge swathes of possession but struggled to break down a resilient Baggies outfit, and the result means United remain in fourth place, just four points clear of Liverpool in fifth. Darren Fletcher: Hailed fantastic team performance Darren Fletcher: Hailed fantastic team performance The visitors set their stall out early, with Pulis’ men ensuring they had plenty of men behind the ball as United dominated possession. Ashley Young was having plenty of joy up against Craig Dawson down the left flank, and the winger had the first effort of the game as he cut on to his right before seeing his shot fly wide via deflections off a defender and Van Persie. West Brom knew their best chance of scoring was likely to be from a set piece, and Lescott spurned a glorious opportunity as he met a corner unmarked only to head his effort straight at David De Gea. Van Persie, making his first start since October, looked determined to find the net and nearly opened the scoring as he drilled a low shot from 20 yards which Boaz Myhill turned away, before Young’s follow-up effort deflected over thanks to Dawson’s vital challenge. Young and Van Persie were at the centre of things again as the winger caused more problems for the West Brom defence, racing towards the line before firing a low cross which Van Persie turned just wide of the near post. Tony Pulis: West Brom had luck on their side Tony Pulis: West Brom had luck on their side It was a frustrating opening period for United and Van Persie in particular as they couldn’t convert their dominance of possession into a half-time lead. And Van Gaal’s side soon settled into their passing stride in the second half, but the Baggies again set themselves up to make life difficult for the hosts, and took a surprise lead on 63 minutes after former United man Darren Fletcher was brought down just outside the area. Brunt stepped up and fired a powerful effort which hit the back of Olsson’s leg before flying into the top corner, with David De Gea given no chance. Thierry Henry felt that Boaz Myhill could have been man of the match Thierry Henry felt that Boaz Myhill could have been man of the match The hosts soon had a penalty appeal turned down as the ball appeared to hit Joleon Lescott’s arm and nothing was given, but minutes later they were awarded a spot kick as Antonio Valencia’s cross hit the outstretched hand of Berahino. But the impressive Myhill guessed correctly, diving low to his left to turn away Van Persie’s effort, before the goalkeeper denied the Dutchman again, this time from a 20-yard free kick drilled low across goal. Paddy McNair then spurned a glorious opportunity, heading wide from an unmarked position as he met Juan Mata’s corner at the far post. Tunnel talk: Patrick Davison and David Provan discuss a 'Pulis masterclass' Tunnel talk: Patrick Davison and David Provan discuss a 'Pulis masterclass' It wasn’t looking like the hosts’ afternoon, with Van Persie becoming increasingly frustrated by the heroics of Myhill. The striker powered another effort at goal, this time a low volley from 25 yards which the Baggies shot-stopper again managed to turn away. He then produced a fingertip save to turn over substitute Angel Di Maria’s effort in stoppage time, and the visitors managed to hold on for a big win to reach 40 points and almost certainly secure survival.

Jose Mourinho’s men found themselves 1-0 down to a Marc Albrighton goal at half-time, but they came out with much more pace and purpose after the break and goals from Didier Drogba, John Terry and Ramires turned the game on its head. The result means that a Chelsea victory against Crystal Palace on Sunday will guarantee them an insurmountable 83-point haul, meaning they cannot be caught at the top. Meanwhile, Leicester, who were good value for their first-half lead, remain outside the relegation places by one point. Mourinho handed a surprise start in goal to Petr Cech in place of Thibaut Courtois, who was not 100 per cent fit according to the Chelsea boss. Drogba was also brought in to add more physicality to their attack, but it was the hosts who started with the most muscle. Esteban Cambiasso picked out Leonardo Ulloa with a fantastic first-time pass that sent the striker through on goal, but Ulloa's first touch was poor and the ball squirmed away from danger. Drogba: Scored Chelsea's first goal Leicester continued to look more threatening in possession as Chelsea struggled to find any tempo to their game. Paul Konchesky forced a smart save low down to his right from Cech on 41 minutes and somehow Chelsea survived a goalmouth scramble that saw Cambiasso and Albrighton go close. Albrighton had not scored a Premier League goal for three years before this clash but you would not have thought it judging by the way he stroked home Leicester’s goal just before half-time. Jamie Vardy did the hard graft down the left wing and sent over a delicious cross along the wet turf which confused Cesar Azpilicueta, who slipped, and Albrighton was the man on the spot to fire home. Terry: Celebrates scoring Chelsea's second Strong words must have been said in the Chelsea dressing room at half-time and they came out a different animal in the second half; full of pace and determination. It took them just three minutes to draw level and it came from a man who has made a career out of scoring big goals at big moments. Drogba showed great striking instinct to find half a yard inside the area and Branislav Ivanovic found the striker with a fine cross, which he swept home confidently. Glenn Hoddle, Jamie Redknapp and Alan Smith praised a 'magnificent' Chelsea side for coming from a goal behind to beat Leicester 3-1 at the King Power stad Glenn Hoddle, Jamie Redknapp and Alan Smith praised a 'magnificent' Chelsea side for coming from a goal behind to beat Leicester 3-1 at the King Power stad Leicester huffed and puffed but failed to deal with the revitalised Chelsea midfield, spearheaded by the brilliant and energetic Willian. Drogba spurned chances to doublie his tally with a couple of wayward shots, but it was his skipper, Terry, that edged Chelsea in front with 11 minutes left. Gary Cahill powered a header towards goal from a Cesc Fabregas corner and although Foxes 'keeper Kasper Schmeichel tipped his header away, Terry was on hand to poke home from two yards. The Chelsea fans were now in full voice, sarcastically singing “boring, boring, Chelsea” in response to the Arsenal fans' chants after the 0-0 draw on Sunday. Ramires: Sealed the deal for Chelsea There was nothing boring about Chelsea's third goal, though, as they turned on the style. Cesc Fabregas danced his way down the right flank and cut the ball back for Ramires, who still had a lot to do, but he found the top corner with a bullet of a strike from the edge of the area to put Chelsea on the cusp of a first title for five years.

The centre-back, who signed from Tottenham last summer, rose unmarked and onside on 37 minutes to head home Ahmed Elmohamady’s cross. Liverpool struggled to create clear-cut chances, going closest in the first half through Philippe Coutinho and Jordan Henderson on a night Steven Gerrard was rested. The home side worked tirelessly to keep the Champions League hopefuls, now short of the top four by seven points, at bay and a second successive Premier League victory sees Hull move four points clear of safety with four games remaining. Hull boss Steve Bruce fielded an unchanged side from the one that beat Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park on Saturday and they continued the huge degree of commitment and work-rate that bore that victory. Mario Balotelli: frustrated throughout Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers started Mario Balotelli for the second successive time, but he was ineffective and frustrated as early as the first minute, clashing with Tom Huddlestone and then Jake Livermore. Hull striker Dame N’Doye threatened first,heading a Sone Aluko cross straight at Simon Mignolet on seven minutes before Coutinho stung the hands of Steve Harper at the other end with a first-time shot from a corner. But it was Balotelli who was arguably at fault for Dawson’s goal – playing the defender onside in his own penalty area despite three other Hull players standing in an offside position. Michael Dawson: opens the scoring Henderson forced Harper into another good save low to his right when latched on to a cross from Jordon Ibe, who was lively before he was replaced in the second half. And Balotelli was further exasperated on the stroke of half-time when he demanded the ball early from Glen Johnson, but did not get it, and was then too late to latch on to the right-back’s flash across the goal-line. The second half was introduced with a moment of comedy, as N’Doye took to the pitch wearing the shirt of Abel Hernandez and had to be alerted to the fact by referee Lee Probert, before dashing to the sidelines to switch. Brendan Rodgers was left frustrated after Liverpool's 1-0 defeat Brendan Rodgers was left frustrated after Liverpool's 1-0 defeat But the fact Liverpool did not get the ball in the attacking third again until just before the hour-mark was no laughing matter, and they were limited to wayward shots off-target from outside the box for the rest of the game. The Reds remain seven points short of fourth-placed Manchester United, with their Champions League hopes seemingly dissipated, but Hull lift themselves above Aston Villa into 15th in the table.

League loss on Louis van Gaal's side. The home team were leading 2-0 at the break after strikes by man-of-the-match James McCarthy and John Stones, the young centre-back's first for his club. Reaction from James McCarthy and John Stones Reaction from James McCarthy and John Stones And the game was ended as a contest when Kevin Mirallas took advantage of poor defending from the visitors to make it 3-0 as Everton moved up to 10th in the table. United remain in fourth, seven points ahead of Liverpool, but having played a game more than the Reds, an anxious end to the campaign could ensue. Everton made a dream start to the match after taking a fifth-minute lead through McCarthy's strike - his third for the Toffees - although United will be disappointed to have conceded from their own corner. Everton display impresses Martinez Everton display impresses Martinez Gareth Barry headed Juan Mata's set-piece clear and then set Seamus Coleman clear down the right flank, before collecting his return pass, dancing through challenges from Daley Blind and Paddy McNair and coolly sliding the ball past David de Gea. The visitors responded though to the shock of falling behind so early by dominating both territory and possession for the remainder of the opening period, but without ever truly testing Tim Howard in the Everton goal. United's best opening before the break fell the way of former Everton midfielder Marouane Fellaini just minutes after going 1-0 down, but the Belgium international could not hit the target from the edge of the area with just Howard to beat, much to the home fans' amusement. Van Gaal questions United spirit Van Gaal questions United spirit If Van Gaal thought his men would be going in at the break just 1-0 down, he was mistaken as Everton doubled their lead after 35 minutes following a flurry of right-wing Leighton Baines corners, the third of which saw Stones power a header home, despite Ashley Young's attempts to clear the ball off the line. The visitors needed to score early in the second period, but like in the opening 45 minutes, they huffed and puffed without reward, their best chance coming just after the break. United centre-back Chris Smalling headed Mata's right-wing corner into the six-yard box but a waiting Wayne Rooney failed to beat Howard from close range. Too much grey area around offsides Too much grey area around offsides Despite Van Gaal introducing the likes of Radamel Falcao, British-record signing Angel Di Maria and the returning Robin van Persie in the second period to liven up his ineffective forward line, United failed to score for the second league outing in succession. And their fate was sealed with 16 minutes to go when Mirallas took advantage of hesitation at the back from Antonio Valencia, who tried to play Romelu Lukaku offside but failed to spot his Belgian colleague. The substitute calmly side-footed home to hand the hosts their biggest win over United in 23 years.

course for a fourth Premier League title after a goalless draw with closest rivals Arsenal all-but ended the Gunners’ chances of catching the league leaders. Referee Michael Oliver proved to be the influential figure in a pulsating first half at the Emirates Stadium as he turned down no more than four penalty claims between the two sides. Terry not celebrating yet Terry not celebrating yet Oscar was involved on two occasions as Hector Bellerin and David Ospina brought the Brazilian down in the area, before former Arsenal midfielder Cesc Fabregas was booked for simulation and Gary Cahill was adjudged to have not blocked Santi Cazorla’s shot with his arm. Didier Drogba replaced Oscar at the interval after the midfielder showed signs of concussion following his collision with Ospina, but he did little to ignite a Chelsea side who seemed content with a point. Mourinho still chasing points Mourinho still chasing points Mesut Ozil and substitute Danny Welbeck spurned glorious chances in the closing stages to hand Arsene Wenger his first victory over a side managed by Jose Mourinho, but Chelsea held on to end Arsenal’s eight-game winning run to move to within six points of their first title in five years. They will now clinch the title if they follow victory at in-form Leicester City on Wednesday with three points against Crystal Palace at Stamford Bridge next Sunday. Mixed emotions for Mertesacker Mixed emotions for Mertesacker Arsenal entered the match knowing anything other than a victory would end their faint hopes of a first title since 2004, and Wenger made four changes to the side which sealed their place in the FA Cup final last weekend. Chelsea knew victory would hand them the chance to seal with title with victory at Leicester in midweek, and started the game with no recognised striker, as Drogba was dropped to the bench with Eden Hazard leading the attack as the lone front man. Mourinho dismisses boring chants Mourinho dismisses boring chants The change of personnel did little to prevent a frenetic start to the game as both sides pushed for the advantage before a string of penalty incidents followed. Oscar appeared to have his heels clipped by full-back Bellerin on eight minutes as the Brazilian threatened to get in behind the Arsenal defence, but Oliver was unmoved. Oscar was involved again on 16 minutes when Arsenal ‘keeper Ospina collided with him after he was played through by Fabregas and chipped an effort towards goal. Bellerin cleared the goal-bound effort before play resumed after the Brazilian received treatment for his injuries. Wenger: We lacked composure Wenger: We lacked composure Replays suggested the penalty kick and a red card may well have been warranted by Ospina's rash challenge. Fabregas, who made his return to Arsenal after leaving in 2011, received a hostile reception at times, none more so than when he was booked for simulation after a challenge from Cazorla on 23 minutes. Oliver was in the spotlight shortly after when Cahill’s apparent block of Cazorla’s shot with his arm went unpunished. Carra: Terry is best PL centre-back Carra: Terry is best PL centre-back Chelsea produced the move of the game when Willian played an incisive pass into his compatriot Ramires before the Brazilian was foiled by Ospina’s smart save. Oscar was withdrawn at the interval after developing signs of concussion at the break, and Drogba, who has often been the scourge of Arsenal, entered the fray. Smith queries penalty decisions Smith queries penalty decisions The intensity of the game dropped in the second period as Chelsea sat deep and looked to hit Arsenal on the counter. The inclusion of Welbeck late injected some pace in the game as Arsenal produced a late push for the three points. Ozil and Welbeck failed to steer Nacho Monreal's cross from the left on target as Chelsea’s defensive unit, as it had done throughout the game, held firm until the end where the final whistle was greeted with wild celebrations by the Chelsea players.

Pelle scored his first just before the half-hour mark largely thanks to poor defending from Ben Davies, before Erik Lamela levelled from close range in controversial fashion just before half-time. Saints were ahead again on 65 minutes as Pelle rose above Federico Fazio to head home superbly, but Spurs equalised for a second time through Nacer Chadli's neat finish from eight yards. The result helps neither side in their race for the Champions League places with four games of the season remaining. Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino was given a heated reception by some Southampton fans on what they coined 'Ronald Koeman day', as the Argentine returned to St Mary's for the first time since leaving the club for White Hart Lane in the summer. Tottenham twice fought back from a goal down to earn a draw at St Mary's against Southampton Tottenham twice fought back from a goal down to earn a draw at St Mary's against Southampton The first clear opportunity of the game fell to the hosts, Hugo Lloris doing well to turn away Morgan Schneiderlin's drive from a James Ward-Prowse corner, but Southampton took the lead on 29 minutes after a catalogue of defensive errors. First, Ryan Mason slipped when attempting to clear after the visitors' had snuffed out Saido Mane's run, before Davies allowed Pelle to poke home from 12 yards despite the defender seemingly being in possession of the ball. Steven Davis had the chance to double Saints' lead shortly after, but the midfielder miscued from 16 yards after Ryan Bertrand's centre. But Spurs levelled through Lamela two minutes before the break, though there was a hint of handball as the Argentine looked to chest the ball goalwards after Harry Kane flicked on Eric Dier's cross. Davis had two more clear chances after the break to trouble Spurs goalkeeper Lloris, but he first dragged his effort wide from 20 yards, before missing the target from close range after a fine turn. But the hosts finally turned their pressure into a second goal as Pelle produced a fine header from 12 yards to beat Lloris from substitute Shane Long's cross. Italian Pelle has now scored three goals in his last three games, having scored just one for Southampton in his previous 17. But Spurs fought back to level for a second time through Chadli, who slotted into the corner from an angle after Dier's fine through ball down the right channel. Toby Alderweireld's diving header in stoppage time was gratefully collected by Lloris and Jose Fonte's header at the death flew just over, as Spurs held on for a point.

bottom three as they defeated relegation rivals Burnley 1-0 in an attritional battle at Turf Moor, the game turning on one dramatic second-half minute. Matt Taylor, making his first start since August, won a penalty for the home side and took it himself but he could only strike the outside of the post with Kapser Schmeichel beaten. Jamie Vardy was the hero for Leicester as his second-half goal was enough to beat Burnley 1-0 at Turf Moor Jamie Vardy was the hero for Leicester as his second-half goal was enough to beat Burnley 1-0 at Turf Moor City promptly broke down the other end and when Marc Albrighton swung in a cross Michael Duff deflected the ball goalwards and despite Tom Heaton's best efforts, Jamie Vardy was on hand to force home what proved the matchwinner (60). The scoreline meant Leicester won four successive top flight matches for the first time since October 1966 and, after 140 days at the bottom of the table before last week's win over Swansea, they are now clear of the drop zone by a single point, something not seen since November 17. For Burnley the wait for a goal goes on as another blank means they are one minute short of eight hours since they last scored on 14 March. Nigel Pearson is refusing to get carried away following Leicester's 1-0 win away at Burnley Nigel Pearson is refusing to get carried away following Leicester's 1-0 win away at Burnley That win over defending champions Manchester City now seems a long time ago as they have taken just one point from five matches and are now five points from safety. Burnley had been dealt a blow before kick-off when striker Sam Vokes was ruled out by injury, handing Lukas Jutkiewicz his first Premier League start in six months. The 26-year-old had more yellow cards (one) than goals in 25 previous Premier League appearances this season so it is safe to assume the Clarets were not pinning their hopes on any survival miracles from him. Danny Ings saw an early shot blocked by Wes Morgan and the best other chance of the error-strewn first half dropped to Taylor but Schmeichel was equal to his close-range flick. Sean Dyche claims Burnley's display in the game against Leicester was enough to win the game but small margins went against them Sean Dyche claims Burnley's display in the game against Leicester was enough to win the game but small margins went against them How pivotal the 90 seconds around the hour mark were may not yet be know but there was no doubt in the minds of the visiting supporters, who celebrated wildly after going ahead. Taylor had been brought down by Paul Konchesky when Schmeichel parried a shot from Ings after the Burnley striker had jinked one way and then the other to create an opening. Taylor, whose last goal was against the Clarets for West Ham in the Capital One Cup in October 2013, picked himself up to take the most pressurised of spot-kicks but - having sent Schmeichel the wrong way - he could only watch in despair as the ball hit the outside of the post and flew behind. To add potential catastrophic injury to that insult, Leicester went straight down the other end where Marc Albrighton's cross cannoned goalwards off Duff for Vardy to pounce on the goal line. Burnley had one real chance to salvage a point but Schmeichel produced a fine reaction save after Robert Huth inadvertently turned Ben Mee's cross goalwards. Survival often hangs on fine margins and Leicester's latest victory could yet yield far greater reward. Phil Thompson's Soccer Saturday verdict Both teams did lack that quality today, both teams were launching it. It's paracetamol all round because there were so many headers! It is just great drama, though. The three centre backs for Leicester – Wasilewski, Huth and Morgan – were absolutely fantastic. Four great victories for Leicester City; they weren’t as good as they were last week but they put in a shift.

After a dominant first half which saw James Chester, N’Doye and Tom Huddlestone all come close, N’Doye hit the post early in the second half before finally breaking the deadlock for the visitors in the 52nd minute when he bundled home from close range. Palace had a Yaya Sanogo header disallowed for a foul on Paul McShane, before N’Doye wrapped up the points in injury time by drilling in to the bottom corner past Julian Speroni.

The hosts, making two changes from last week’s defeat to West Brom, almost took an early lead when Jason Puncheon’s bending free-kick fell to the feet of Glenn Murray at the far post as Hull failed to clear their lines, but Steve Harper blocked the close range effort. Palace’s defence struggled to cope with crosses, primarily from Robbie Brady, in to the area, with James Chester heading over from close range when unmarked from a corner. Hull City manager Steve Bruce explains his relief at the away win against Crystal Palace Hull City manager Steve Bruce explains his relief at the away win against Crystal Palace Three minutes later, Brady’s pin-point cross from the corner of the area was met by N’Doye on the stretch, but the striker couldn’t turn the ball goal-bound from no more than six yards out. Julian Speroni had to be alert on several occasions during the first half, with the keeper forced in to a fingertip save to flick Tom Huddlestone’s bending effort around the post and later smothering Aluko’s dinked effort. The visitors had a big penalty appeal turned away when Ahmed Elmohamady’s cross struck the hand of Murray, before squandering another chance to break the deadlock late on in the half when Jake Livermore underhit his attempted lob over Speroni from the edge of the area. Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew was left disappointed with referee Mark Clattenburg's performance Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew was left disappointed with referee Mark Clattenburg's performance Hull started the second half brightly when N’Doye’s header from Elmohamady’s cross deflected on to the post, eventually taking the lead four minutes later as Brady’s shot ricocheted off Speroni and then winger to fall to N’Doye to tap in. Eagles boss Pardew sent Yaya Sanogo and fit-again Lee Chung-yong into the fray in a bid to cajole some kind of attacking intent, but the hosts struggled to create clear chances. Bolasie struck limply at goal rather than square to Sanogo as Palace finally started to threaten, while Arsenal loanee Sanogo headed home late on, only for referee Mark Clattenburg to chalk off the goal for pulling on to Paul McShane. The away side continued to push for a second, with Elmohamady seeing an effort flash wide and Liam Rosenior rattling the woodwork with a dipping volley from the edge of the area. As Palace pressed, Hull disposed Lee on the half way and raced clear, with substitute Gaston Ramirez feeding N'Doye, who blasted home from an angle to wrap up a deserved win.

After failing to create clear-cut chances in a half in which they dominated, Newcastle's hopes of victory were dealt a blow when Swansea snatched an equaliser on the stroke of half time through on-loan Benfica striker Nelson Oliveira, who scored his first goal since moving to the Liberty Stadium.

There were protests by home fans among a crowd of 46,884 - the official attendance was lower than last Sunday's against Tottenham when supporters were urged to stay away - both before and during the game, with owner Mike Ashley the target of pre-arranged action in the 34th minute, drawing attention to the £34m the club banked during the last financial year.

Having found space on the left, Riviere centred the ball where Amat misplaced his clearance straight to Perez for a simple finish. Ashley Williams was Swansea’s biggest threat in the first half but, having created space in the area on two separate occassions while up for corners, the captain first headed wide before directing another corner straight at Tim Krul. As half time approached, Newcastle had the chance to secure their lead at the break when Riviere rounded off a fine attack by heading Vernon Anita’s cross goalwards. Lukasz Fabianski produced a fine save to deny the Frenchman, and Swansea capitalised on their goalkeepers' heroics, drawing level shortly after as Newcastle failed to heed their previous warnings from corners, and Oliveira headed home. John Carver thinks Newcastle's performance in the 3-2 defeat to Swansea was not good enough John Carver thinks Newcastle's performance in the 3-2 defeat to Swansea was not good enough Refreshed by Monk's half-time team-talk, Swansea started the second period the better of the two sides and quickly had the lead as Montero’s cross was dummied by Oliveira and fell into the path of Sigurdsson for him to stroke past Krul. Frustration began to creep into both the players and fans at St James’ Park as the home side toiled to get back into the game, before their misery was deepened when Oliveira turned provider and handed Cork a close-range finish to complete the comeback. De Jong pulled one back with a controlled finish late on, but Newcastle were helpless in preventing Swansea from claiming their third consecutive victory at St James’ Park, the second of which to be achieved from a losing position. The result sees Swansea surpass their Premier League record points total of 47, they remain eighth on 50 points, while Newcastle remain 14th on 35 points, starring over their shoulders.

Austin's kick from 12 yards was saved by the legs of Adrian following James Collins' handball, while Richard Dunne saw his bundled effort ruled out for a foul on the keeper, leaving the hosts to rue a missed opportunity to grab three valuable points. The result leaves them four points adrift of safety, with trips to Manchester City and Liverpool to come in the next two weeks before they host Newcastle in their final home game of the season and then travel to Leicester. This draw then - against a dispirited West Ham team that has now won just twice in 17 games - was a huge chance lost. West Ham's Reece Burke made his Premier League debut for the club as they drew 0-0 with QPR at Loftus Road West Ham's Reece Burke made his Premier League debut for the club as they drew 0-0 with QPR at Loftus Road They might have led inside 60 seconds as Matt Phillips nicked the ball off Mark Noble and surged through midfield before feeding Sandro, whose low shot from the angle was beaten away at his near post by Adrian. A sparky opening to the game then saw West Ham go as close as they would all game as Reece Burke - making his Premier League debut at 18 in the heart of the West Ham defence - then met Matt Jarvis' corner with a well-timed leap only to see his header hacked off the line. As the game settled, so the quality dipped, with both sides struggling to create until the move of the match set up Austin's penalty on 20 minutes - Phillips, Joey Barton and Nedum Onouha all combining to find Bobby Zamora in the box. QPR manager Chris Ramsey says his side rely too much on Charlie Austin for goals QPR manager Chris Ramsey says his side rely too much on Charlie Austin for goals The former West Ham man's first touch was poor, but the ball bounced up and as he tried to lob Adrian, so the ball hit the raised hands of Collins, leaving referee Mike Jones with one of his easier decisions of the afternoon. Austin's penalty was poor though, struck straight down the middle, allowing Adrian to save his third straight penalty and his miss sapped the belief from the hosts as the game meandered towards half-time - West Ham lacking the quality to expose their fragile opponents. They did test Robert Green just after the break, Aaron Cresswell's free-kick forcing a fingertip save from the former England keeper, but their ambition faded thereafter as QPR, led by a rambunctious Barton, searched for the elusive breakthrough. Barton's industry earned Sandro a sight of goal, but his shot flew a couple of yards over before Zamora bullied young Burke off the ball only to fire wide having worked a yard of space. Sam Allardyce praised Adrian after his third penalty save in a row for the club helped West Ham to a goalless draw at QPR Sam Allardyce praised Adrian after his third penalty save in a row for the club helped West Ham to a goalless draw at QPR When they did have the ball in the net - Dunne stooping to head home from close range - it was quickly chalked off by Jones' whistle following a foul on Adrian by Steven Caulker. The Hammers briefly threatened on the break when Enner Valencia outpaced Dunne and squared for Cheikhou Kouyate, but he could only balloon over from 10 yards with the goal beckoning. Back came QPR though and with time running down, Phillips' half-volley from the angle then drew a wonderful save from Adrian while Nedum Onouha's delicious cross somehow evaded everyone as West Ham held on, leaving the hosts to ponder on the potential cost of Austin's penalty miss.

Connor Wickham gave Sunderland the lead within the opening minute after capitalising on an error by Stoke keeper Asmir Begovic, but Adam netted a superb leveller before half-time. The visitors held on for the point but results elsewhere saw them drop into the precarious position of 18th with just five games left to go this season. Sunderland had made the briskest of starts, Wickham putting them ahead in the opening minute. Stoke's Charlie Adam says it was frustrating to only earn a point against Sunderland Stoke's Charlie Adam says it was frustrating to only earn a point against Sunderland Will Buckley got down the right for the Black Cats before whipping one straight into the arms of Begovic. It was the kind of effort the Stoke keeper would usually easily smother nine times out of ten, but he somehow managed to let it squirm out of his grip and into the path of Wickham – who took a touch before toe-poking in from close-range. Stoke responded well, however, and took the game immediately back to Sunderland. First, Jonathan Walters had a low effort smartly saved from the edge of the area, before Stephen Ireland’s long-range volley was nearly deflected in by a defender. But it was Sunderland who had the next genuine opportunity to score, with Jermain Defoe the guilty party as he fired into the side netting from a position in the area where he really should have done better. Stoke manager Mark Hughes says it was an extremely poor start to concede so early in their 1-1 draw with Sunderland Stoke manager Mark Hughes says it was an extremely poor start to concede so early in their 1-1 draw with Sunderland And the former Tottenham striker was made to rue his miss just moments later when Adam levelled the game. The Scot may be more well-known for his left foot, but he proved he was just as capable with his right by driving one home into the top right-hand corner after the ball had dropped back to him on the edge of the area. Stoke defender Phillipp Wollscheid may consider himself a little lucky to have escaped red just before the interval, after he caught John O'Shea full in the face with studs as the Irish defender went in for a header. There were chances at both ends as the second-half progressed. In quick succession Billy Jones charged into the area before seeing his shot saved impressively by Begovic, before Walters headed over from close-range at the other end when he probably should have done better. Dick Advocaat says Sunderland created some good chances in their 1-1 draw with Stoke Dick Advocaat says Sunderland created some good chances in their 1-1 draw with Stoke Mame Biram Diouf then had a real chance to put Stoke in front after the ball had found him from a Adam free-kick, but his effort was saved superbly at point-blank range by Costel Pantilimon in the Sunderland goal. Adam, ever a threaten from long-range, then had a chance to win it late on, but his shot that seemed destined for the top corner was just tipped wide by the Black Cats keeper. A point at the Britannia would never usually be a bad result for Sunderland, but Dick Advocaat’s side now find themselves in real trouble after wins for relegation rivals Hull and Leicester City.

top-four finish were dealt a serious blow as they were held to a goalless draw by West Brom at the Hawthorns. The Reds dominated the match for long periods, but they were unable to find a way through the well-organised hosts and the draw left them six points behind fourth-placed Manchester City. After an uneventful first half, West Brom goalkeeper Boaz Myhill pulled off a superb double save to deny Philippe Coutinho and Jordan Henderson. Jordan Ibe also hit a deflected effort onto the top of the bar, while substitute Callum McManaman went closest for West Brom with a low shot which was blocked by Simon Mignolet. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers says he was very proud of his players Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers says he was very proud of his players Liverpool made a lively start, with Raheem Sterling and Ibe threatening on the flanks as the Reds showed no sign of a Wembley hangover following their FA Cup defeat to Aston Villa. But despite dominating possession, the visitors struggled to create clear-cut chances. Coutinho failed to hit the target from 25 yards and Steven Gerrard, making his 500th Premier League appearance, curled a free kick narrowly over after Mario Balotelli was fouled on the edge of the box. Coutinho was at the heart of the action, and the Brazilian tried to catch Boaz Myhill out with an audacious effort from the halfway line. The West Brom goalkeeper was off his line but Coutinho’s shot trickled harmlessly wide. Balotelli was next to try his luck when he lashed a first-time effort narrowly over from the left-hand side of the box, but the Reds came no closer to breaking the deadlock before half-time. West Brom, meanwhile, were well-drilled at the back but offered next to nothing going forward in a one-sided first period. Tony Pulis says he is happy with a hard-earned point after West Brom's 0-0 draw with Liverpool Tony Pulis says he is happy with a hard-earned point after West Brom's 0-0 draw with Liverpool Liverpool continued to dominate after the break and they were desperately close to scoring in the 55th minute. After Balotelli’s effort was blocked, Myhill got down low to save Coutinho’s follow-up before somehow blocking the rebound from Jordan Henderson at point-blank range. It was a lucky escape for the Baggies, but they almost broke the deadlock against the run of play moments later when Craig Gardner volleyed Chris Brunt’s deep cross into the side netting. The game had come to life, and Ibe was inches from putting the Reds in front when he played a one-two with Balotelli before firing a deflected effort onto the crossbar. Once again, West Brom responded by carving out a chance of their own. Martin Skrtel failed to clear a cross from the right and James Morrison sent a looping header beyond Simon Mignolet, only for Dejan Lovren to make a crucial goal line clearance. Liverpool piled on the pressure at the other end as Lovren scooped a corner over the bar and Gerrard shot straight at Myhill, but still they struggled to find a way through the blue and white shirts. West Brom substitute Callum McManaman sent a shot straight at Mignolet on a rare foray forward from the home side, before Coutinho attempted another long-range effort at the other end. Myhill looked beaten but his dipping drive landed on the roof of the net. Brendan Rodgers sent on Fabio Borini and Adam Lallana in the closing stages, but neither was able to make the difference. In fact, it was West Brom sub McManaman who came closest to breaking the deadlock when Mignolet saved his diagonal shot with his legs after ghosting past Skrtel. Lovren headed a Gerrard cross over the bar at the death, but there was to be no late winner for the either side.

Manuel Pellegrini's men, who are now nine points clear of Liverpool in fifth, were handed the perfect start when Brad Guzan horribly miskicked Ron Vlaar's back pass straight to Sergio Aguero, who tapped home into an empty net from close range. Jamie Redknapp believes Aston Villa should never have allowed Brad Guzan to be in a position to make such a mistake for Aguero's opener Jamie Redknapp believes Aston Villa should never have allowed Brad Guzan to be in a position to make such a mistake for Aguero's opener City doubled their advantage in the 66th minute when Aleksandar Kolarov took advantage of a poor Villa wall to bend a free-kick past Guzan but the visitors struck back almost immediately thanks to Tom Cleverley's strike. Villa looked like grabbing a vital point in the fight for survival when Carlos Sanchez steered the ball home in the 85th minute - and they thought they should have had a penalty just minutes later when Christian Benteke was tripped in the penalty box by Joe Hart. But City were rescued by a controversial offside flag and then Fernandinho popped up with just one minute of normal time remaining to fire a the late winner to send them nine points behind the leaders Chelsea, who play Arsenal on Sunday. Aston Villa's Christian Benteke was adjudged to be offside before being brought down by Joe Hart at 2-2 Aston Villa's Christian Benteke was adjudged to be offside before being brought down by Joe Hart at 2-2 It was heartbreak for Tim Sherwood and his side, who are now just two points above the relegation zone with four games remaining. It was a sedate opening in Manchester and there was not much noise coming from the home fans but that immediately changed in the fourth minute as Guzan’s terrible attempt at a clearance from Ron Vlaar’s back pass gifted Aguero the opening goal of the game. It was the perfect start for Pellegrini’s men and a moment Guzan, who was left out of last weekend’s FA Cup semi-final, will want to forget as Villa struggled to get going following their FA Cup heroics. Minutes later Yaya Toure split open the visitor’s defence, playing Jesus Navas in behind but the Spaniard’s cross was well cut out with Aguero waiting to pounce. Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini admitted that the 3-2 victory over Aston Villa was one of their worst games of the season possession wise Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini admitted that the 3-2 victory over Aston Villa was one of their worst games of the season possession wise In the 17th minute, the hapless Guzan was again in the thick of the action as he missed Kolarov’s free-kick but Fernando could not capitalise, steering his header wide of the target. Sherwood would have warned his troops about an FA Cup hangover before the game but the message clearly did not get through to his players as Aguero latched onto Leandro Bacuna’s horror back pass. The Argentina international cut back on his right foot but Jores Okore was well placed to make a vital intervention. Villa were lucky to be just one behind but they finally clicked into gear after 27 minutes and should have been level as the ricocheted into the path of Christian Benteke, but his shot was smartly saved by Joe Hart. Aston Villa manager Tim Sherwood was adamant that Joe Hart should have seen red after fouling Christian Benteke Aston Villa manager Tim Sherwood was adamant that Joe Hart should have seen red after fouling Christian Benteke With half-time approaching Villa were starting to put City under serious pressure as Jack Grealish and Fabian Delph got into the game, however, they could not take advantage with Benteke heading over from close range from Kieran Richardson’s cross. City were forced into a change at the break when Toure, who picked up a knock in a challenge with Delph just before the break, was replaced by Fernandinho and the home side looked to put Villa on the back foot as Navas’ cross just evaded Frank Lampard. However, Sherwood’s men were not backing down as Benteke combined with Grealish to create an opening for Delph, but the England midfielder’s shot sailed inches wide of the far post. Pellegrini sent for James Milner, who replaced the ineffectual Lampard, as City tried to grab a foothold in the game and they finally doubled their advantage when Kolarov’s pin-point free-kick nestled into the back of the net. The home fans could have been forgiven for thinking all three points were in the bag but Villa responded just minutes later after Hart flapped at a long ball and Cleverley was on hand to score his first goal for Villa. The turnaround was complete when Hart’s attempted clearance from Delph’s corner fell to Sanchez, who stroked the ball into the back of the net with just five minutes remaining. City could even have lost the game and were thankful for a dubious offside flag against Benteke before he was tripped in the penalty box by Hart. However, it was Villa’s turn to think they had snatched a vital point in the fight for Premier League survival but there was time for one final piece of drama as the ball fell to substitute Fernandinho, who scissor-kicked the ball past Guzan to seal all three points and send City a step closer to Champions League qualification.

James Collins gifted the home side the opener with an own-goal after 18 minutes and Sergio Aguero added a second before half-time. The result sees City reduce United’s lead over them to just a single point, after the third-placed side lost 1-0 at Chelsea on Saturday evening. A real concern for City, however, will be the injury suffered by David Silva, who was forced off on a stretcher after taking an elbow to the face from Cheikhou Kouyate midway through the second half. Yaya Toure: Delighted to see Man City's team spirit back Yaya Toure: Delighted to see Man City's team spirit back After the 4-2 dismantling at Old Trafford last weekend, Manchester City could not have wished for a better game in which to bounce back than at home to West Ham – who from the first whistle had the look of a team who knew their season was already over. The first sign of danger for the Hammers came within five minutes when Silva got in behind their defence and managed to bring a pass down from Martin Demichelis, but the Spaniard couldn’t quite get his shot away before he was blocked off. Sam Allardyce’s side looked well off the pace and their sloppy play at the back saw them give the ball away on more than one occasion in the early stages, a trait that led to both goals they conceded in the opening half. Manchester City's Frank Lampard battles with Mark Noble First, Adrian’s goal kick that barely reached the halfway line was picked up by Navas, who charged forward menacingly. His cross from the right was poor and only reached defender Collins, but the Welsh international got his feet into a major muddle and somehow managed to slice the ball over his own keeper under no real pressure. Then, with less than 10 minutes until half time, Stewart Downing relinquished possession on halfway, only for Aguero to pick it up and skip past Collins before driving at the heart of West Ham’s defence. The Argentine then played a little one-two with the lively Navas before finishing calmly from close range. City were two up and cruising. Sam Allardyce: We couldn't deal with City pressure Sam Allardyce: We couldn't deal with City pressure And they continued to dominate after the break, with Aguero and Silva both having chances that they couldn't quite convert for a City third. On the whole it was a satisfying afternoon for Manuel Pellegrini, with the only real negative from the game being the injury to Silva after his collision with Kouyate. The West Ham midfielder was booked for his troubles but he could easily have seen red for a challenge that saw the City midfielder taken off on a stretcher to a warm ovation from all corners of the Etihad after seven minutes of treatment. Understandably, the game lost a little momentum after the injury to Silva and other than a decent chance for Enner Valencia the home side never looked in any real danger, cruising to a victory that also sees them extend their gap over fifth-place Liverpool to seven points.

Kane scores the third goal poast Tim Krul. Newcastle suffered their sixth straight Premier League defeat as Tottenham ran out 3-1 winners at a disgruntled St James’ Park. Nacer Chadli opened the scoring on 30 minutes with a long range strike before Jack Colback equalised just 19 seconds into the second half. That should have provided a springboard for the hosts to kick on but their momentum was halted just seven minutes later by a Christian Eriksen free-kick. Harry Kane netted a late third - his 30th goal of the season. Sunderland fans mock Newcastle fans with cheeky message A fan boycott inside the stadium from the home fans against Newcastle chairman Mike Ashley never really materialised, although the attendance of 47,427 was the club's lowest of the season, but there were protests pre-match with anti-Ashley banners being held aloft by frustrated Toon fans, who also booed their team off at full-time. It was a thoroughly depressing afternoon for the locals, who also had to endure a cheeky taunt from Sunderland fans after a plane with a banner reading 'five in a row' was flown over St James’ Park midway through the first-half. Harry Kane: Tottenham deserved victory Harry Kane: Tottenham deserved victory The victory lifts Spurs back up to sixth in the table but they are still seven points behind Manchester City, who occupy the final Champions League spot. The main excitement in the opening stages happened in the skies with the Sunderland banner but that changed thanks to Chadli’s opener on 35 minutes. The attacking midfielder emerged from a scrappy period in the centre of the pitch before letting fly with a shot from 25 yards that evaded the clutches of Tim Krul in the Newcastle goal. Harry Kane of Spurs is chased down by Fabricio Coloccini of Newcastle United. John Carver made two substitutions at the break to freshen his side up and much like in the corresponding fixture at White Hart Lane when Sami Ameobi scored inside eight seconds of the restart, Spurs fell asleep again. Daryl Janmaat was the instigator of the move, robbing Chadli of possession by the touchline before finding Ayoze Pérez in the box. The striker shifted the ball back to Janmaat who had continued his run into the box and although his shot was blocked, Colback was hand to slam the ball home with just 19 seconds played in the second period. The good feeling around St James’ Park lasted just seven minutes as Eriksen struck. Jamie Carragher questions Mike Ashley's ownership of Newcastle Jamie Carragher questions Mike Ashley's ownership of Newcastle He sent in a wicked delivery from the left flank that caused confusion in the Newcastle defence as Kane and the excellent Nabil Bentaleb attacked the ball and diverted the attention of Krul. Neither Kane nor Bentaleb got a touch and although Krul got a hand to Eriksen’s whipped in delivery, he couldn’t stop the ball from nestling in the net. Nacer Chadli celebrates after putting Tottenham in front. Kane had gone two games without a goal and his drought looked like continuing when he was denied by Krul on 66 minutes - one of a few missed chances - after being found by another brilliant Eriksen set-piece. However, the England man would get his name on the scoresheet in the closing stages when he latched onto a Erik Lamela through ball and coolly slotted into the bottom corner.

Morrison headed in unmarked from a second-minute corner to put the visiting side in front at Selhurst Park and Palace, despite enjoying plenty of possession, could not find a way past Boaz Myhill in the Albion goal. Gardner then fired past Julian Speroni from 25 yards in the second half to seal the win and move West Brom eight points above the relegation places in 13th, while Palace - who were suffering their eighth home defeat - stay 11th. West Brom midfielder James Morrison is targeting 40 points West Brom midfielder James Morrison is targeting 40 points Yannick Bolasie saw an audacious overhead volley saved, while substitute Dwight Gayle hit the crossbar and Yaya Sanogo saw his attempt ruled out for offside as Palace were frustrated at every turn. The visitors got the best possible start as Morrison evaded Jason Puncheon and was free to head home Chris Brunt's corner from six yards in the second minute. Palace were not playing in their usual free-flowing manner and their first chance was a tame effort from James McArthur which was easily held by Myhill. Things could have got worse for the hosts on 15 minutes as Mile Jedinak looked to have wrestled Victor Anichebe to the ground in the box - but referee Jon Moss was unmoved by Albion's appeals. West Brom manager Tony Pulis was happy with their 2-0 win against his former side West Brom manager Tony Pulis was happy with their 2-0 win against his former side Myhill was again on hand to deny an acrobatic overhead kick from Bolasie shortly afterwards as the Eagles began to dominate possession. The home side still went in behind at the interval, with boss Alan Pardew making a double change at half-time as he introduced Gayle and Pape Souare in place of Jedinak and Joe Ledley. But it was the Baggies who struck again as Brunt's corner drifted out to Gardner - who collected the ball before firing past Speroni to double his side's advantage. Gayle should have reduced the arrears almost immediately but could only head against the crossbar from inside the six-yard box after Bolasie's driven cross. Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew believes the scoreline in their 2-0 defeat to West Brom was unfair Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew believes the scoreline in their 2-0 defeat to West Brom was unfair Saido Berahino had been quiet for West Brom but almost added a third as he wriggled free from Damien Delaney and Scott Dann before seeing his effort turned behind by Speroni. Delaney then came close to giving Palace a lifeline, but Myhill claimed his downward header, with substitute Sanogo then seeing a tap-in ruled out for offside as Pardew tasted league defeat for just the fourth time as Palace boss. Soccer Saturday verdict - Matt Le Tissier \"When West Brom take the lead in a game it suits them down to the ground. They just sit in and defend brilliantly. \"Palace spent a lot of time in West Brom's half without really creating any clear chances.

Kevin Mirallas gave Everton the lead just before the half-hour mark and when Ashley Barnes was sent off just before half-time for a second bookable offence there was no way back for the visitors. A win would have lifted Sean Dyche’s men out of the drop zone but instead they are now bottom of the Premier League with just five games left to play. Everton midfielder Kevin Mirallas was delighted to score the only goal Everton midfielder Kevin Mirallas was delighted to score the only goal For Everton, the season is ending on something of a high after their Europa League travails and a fourth win in five games rarely looked in doubt as they troubled Burnley from the outset. Indeed, Roberto Martinez’s men should have gone ahead from the penalty spot inside the opening 10 minutes when Aaron Lennon was brought down by David Jones right on the edge of the box. Long-time penalty taker Leighton Baines was on the pitch but instead it was Barkley who took responsibility only to see his effort saved by goalkeeper Tom Heaton away to his right. Everton did not have long to wait for the breakthrough, however, when Mirallas capitalised on good work from James McCarthy down the right flank to give the home side the lead. Roberto Martinez says he is happy to have reached the 40-point mark Roberto Martinez says he is happy to have reached the 40-point mark Mirallas met McCarthy’s cut-back and while his first attempt got stuck under his feet, he was able to prod it past Heaton at the second time of asking to score his sixth Premier League goal of the season. Jones squandered a good chance to equalise soon after with Burnley well in the contest for the remainder of the half, but Barnes’ red card ensured the opening 45 minutes ended on a sour note. Barnes has committed more fouls than anyone in the Premier League this season and was punished for a foul on Seamus Coleman having already gone to ground once when lunging in on McCarthy. Mirallas was lucky not to join Barnes when he caught George Boyd with his studs early in the second half but escaped with only a yellow card from referee Mike Jones. Everton dominated possession as would be expected but were a little wasteful in front of goal, most notably when McCarthy passed the ball just wide of the post when well placed. Burnley manager Sean Dyche highlights key decisions which he believes went against his side Burnley manager Sean Dyche highlights key decisions which he believes went against his side Gareth Barry might have ended all hope of an equaliser had he finished when unmarked at the far post but instead it was the 10 men who forced an anxious finish for Martinez’s men. Danny Ings, without a goal in eight games now, might even have earned his side a point had he hit the target with a free header from close range. But the chance was spurned and Everton claimed the three points to move within two points of the top half of the league table. Burnley will just be hoping to be in that Premier League next season. Soccer Saturday verdict - Paul Merson \"Burnley will feel hard done by. Ashley Barnes has got two yellows for his enthusiasm. The second one did not deserve it. They also should have had a penalty. It was handball by John Stones. Stonewall penalty. \"Then, Mirallas goes into a tackle on Boyd’s shin. When the referee sees it back he will be disappointed not to have given a red.

Leonardo Ulloa gave the home side a deserved lead in the 15th minute after good work from skipper Wes Morgan to make space for the Argentine to fire home. Ulloa was not even in the starting XI an hour before kick-off, but an injury to David Nugent in the warm-up meant the former Brighton hitman was given his chance. Andy King made sure of the win in the dying moments of the match after the hosts had missed several chances to make sure of the victory. Leonardo Ulloa says Leicester always believed they could beat the drop Leonardo Ulloa says Leicester always believed they could beat the drop Swansea offered very little in attack, and looked toothless up front without the injured Bafetembi Gomis. The result sees Nigel Pearson's men move up to 18th, level on points with Hull above them, and give the Leicester faithful a real sense that the great escape could well be on. Right from the word go, the hosts looked really up for the encounter on a glorious afternoon in the East Midlands and they got their reward for their endeavours as Ulloa rifled the Foxes into the lead. A long ball was lumped into the box, Morgan held off his man, and on the run, Ulloa smashed the ball past Lukasz Fabianski in the Swansea goal to give the hosts the perfect start. The intensity from the home side was incredible, and they should really have gone into the break with more to show for their efforts.

Kasper Schmeichel then produced a stunning save reminiscent of his famous father to deny Nelson Oliveira when through on goal and keep his side in front. The chances continued to come for Pearson’s men, but Fabianski was in fine form too, and proving a tough nut to crack. Referee Lee Probert then made a huge call to deny Leicester what looked like a penalty for a clash between Ashley Williams and Jamie Vardy. However, in stoppage time, King popped up with another vital strike to make sure of the result. Swansea manager Garry Monk felt that his team deserved more Swansea manager Garry Monk felt that his team deserved more Cambiasso’s free-kick proved too hot to handle for Fabianski, who could only fumble the ball into the path of the alert King, who bravely side-footed home to send the King Power into raptures, and give those jubilant fans real hope that they could be seeing top flight football next season.

Charlie Adam's late strike completed the fightback to steal the points for the hosts, who were outplayed for large parts of the game and behind at the break thanks to Morgan Schneiderlin's fourth Premier League goal of the season. But Mame Biram Diouf's bizarre equaliser just after half-time levelled matters before Adam crashed home the winner in a crowded area with five minutes remaining. Stoke City's Charlie Adam was happy to score again Stoke City's Charlie Adam was happy to score again The result was tough on the visitors, who remain sixth, five points behind fourth-placed Manchester City, who have a game in hand. For Mark Hughes' side, they consolidated their place in the top half of the table, moving above West Ham into ninth. A feisty, open game in the Staffordshire sunshine saw Saints take the lead on 22 minutes when Schneiderlin got the final touch at the far post from Jose Fonte's near-post header. Ronald Koeman's men might have already been ahead had referee Mark Clattenburg decided Stephen Ireland's clumsy push on Sadio Mane was worthy of a penalty, while Graziano Pelle fired into the side-netting from Mane's expert turn and slide-rule pass. Once Schneiderlin had scored, Nathanial Clyne was grateful to only see yellow following a two-footed sliding challenge on Glenn Whelan and the England right-back, restored to the starting line-up after missing the victory over Hull last week, then fired over the bar as Southampton's passing game began to pull their hosts all over the pitch. Despite being bright in possession and sharp in the challenge, Stoke were struggling to create, yet should have been level just before the break, when a long ball into the box was flicked on by Marko Arnautovic, but Stephen N'Zonzi could only poke the ball wide from five yards out with the goal beckoning. Mark Hughes was delighted with his side's win over Southampton Mark Hughes was delighted with his side's win over Southampton But they did have their goal immediately after half-time after a horrible error by Southampton keeper Kelvin Davis. N'Zonzi's chipped ball over the top from 30 yards out was over-hit and looked to be sailing out of play; Davis certainly thought so, but it dipped in the breeze and hit the bar before rebounding to Diouf, who was unerring in his half-volley from eight yards out. Still, Southampton remained the team most likely, with Mane's pace in behind a constant threat and he was unlucky to be flagged offside when clean through before beating Asmir Begovic to a through-ball. The Stoke keeper managed to hold him up on the edge of the box, but Mane found Dusan Tadic, whose goalbound effort was cleared off the line by Whelan. And Stoke looked out of ideas and ready for a point when Southampton failed to clear a long-free-kick into the box, allowing Arnautovic's subsequent cross to fall to Adam via Jonathan Walters' blocked shot and the midfielder crashed home through a crowded area from 10 yards. Hoping to mount a late response, Southampton were stymied by what looked a serious injury to Toby Alderwierald, forcing them to play the last few minutes with only 10 men and Stoke were able to hold on comfortably. Soccer Saturday verdict - Charlie Nicholas \"First half, when they were leading, Southampton were the best team. They passed it better, had more quality going forward. \"Stoke didn’t play particularly well, but a bit of good fortune for Stoke turned it around. Schneiderlin got the first goal and Southampton should have gone on to get a second. The equaliser was crazy, such a slice of luck. Charlie Adam was offside for the winner too.

Manchester United. The Belgian fired the hosts in front shortly before the break in a half largely dominated by Louis van Gaal’s side, who nearly took an early lead through Wayne Rooney. Eden Hazard has admitted that Chelsea were lucky to score during the first half Eden Hazard has admitted that Chelsea were lucky to score during the first half It could have been 2-0 after the break as Hazard hit the crossbar from close range, while Rooney saw another effort go wide and Radamel Falcao hit the post as the visitors saw far more of the ball. Ander Herrera thought he had won a penalty in stoppage time only to be booked for diving. And a resilient Chelsea dug in to take victory, the result moving them 10 points clear of Arsenal and 11 above United, putting the Blues within touching distance of their first league title in five seasons. They can become champions with wins in their next two games. Hazard celebrates his first-half winner It was a confident start from United, who were clearly looking to take control of possession and play through Chelsea. They should have been in front inside four minutes as Luke Shaw raced forward before pulling the ball back to the edge of the box for Rooney, who had plenty of time and space but could only pull his shot wide of the target. The effort initially looked like it had gone in, and it fooled both the travelling fans and David de Gea at the opposite end, prompting much derision from the Chelsea supporters. Jose Mourinho: Game went exactly to plan Jose Mourinho: Game went exactly to plan De Gea almost suffered further embarrassment as a ball came in from the right and the goalkeeper raced to get to it in front of Hazard. The ball appeared to hit the goalkeeper’s arm outside the box, but it wasn’t spotted by the officials and the Spaniard escaped punishment. Despite United’s dominance on the ball, chances were at a premium, and it wasn’t until the 38th minute that the first shot on target was registered as Chelsea took the lead. The ball was played in from the left for Oscar, who produced a delightful backheel through the middle for Hazard, and the Belgian charged into the area before firing a left-footed shot underneath De Gea. The visitors were angry with the strike, however, as John Terry appeared to foul Radamel Falcao in midfield in the build-up. Hazard nearly made it 2-0 but could only find the crossbar But the goal stood as the pattern of play continued in the same vein after the break, although it was Chelsea who nearly doubled their lead within the first 10 minutes of the half. Didier Drogba was played through and his shot looped over De Gea thanks to a deflection off Chris Smalling, but Hazard could only find the crossbar with his jumping volley. It wasn’t until the 61st minute when Van Gaal’s men finally brought a save out of Thibaut Courtois, who had to be alert to parry away Paddy McNair’s drilled 25-yard effort. Rooney then fired just wide of the target after meeting Fellaini’s knock-down, only to see it deflect off target as the visitors continued to see all of the ball. Falcao worked hard up front for United but struggled for opportunities, his best effort of the match coming from Shaw’s pass as he then sliced a shot onto the post from a tight angle. Louis van Gaal: Refused to concede the title to Chelsea Louis van Gaal: Refused to concede the title to Chelsea Chelsea looked confident of victory as the game moved into stoppage time, but referee Mike Dean had to make a key decision as Herrera charged down a loose ball in the box before tripping over Gary Cahill’s leg. The referee blew the whistle straight away but booked the United midfielder for simulation, and the hosts held on for a key victory to move themselves even closer to the Premier League title.

Newcastle’s night got worse when Sissoko was booked twice in five minutes to hand the club their sixth sending off in as many matches against Liverpool. Sterling had one final chance to round the scoring off, receiving the ball unmarked 16-yards from goal but he couldn’t keep his shot on target. Newcastle, who have now suffered five straight league defeats, stay in 13th but Liverpool, who Rodgers believed were out of the race for fourth after defeat at Arsenal, move up into fifth just four points behind Manchester City.

With Drogba leading the line, the Blues’ pattern of play in the first half saw a number of long balls played up to the Ivorian, but Rangers centre-backs Nedum Onuoha and Steven Caulker dealt with the aerial assault. Similarly, Rangers tried to find Bobby Zamora and Austin in advanced positions and, while this proved to be a fruitless venture at times, Rangers still posed a threat.

Austin could not get decent purchase on a late scramble in the Chelsea area and, with both sides seemingly resigned to a goalless draw, Chelsea proved their worth with the winner. Green's sliced clearance fell kindly to Hazard - making his 100th Premier League appearance - who danced in off the left flank and laid the ball into the path of the Spaniard at the edge of the area who scored Chelsea's 100th goal in all competitions this season.

City struggled to create any clear-cut openings and were perhaps fortunate not to have captain Vincent Kompany sent off as he was only shown yellow for a studs-up tackle on Daley Blind.

On-loan Lennon grabbed the second goal of his loan spell from Tottenham after a flowing move in the first half, before Shelvey slotted home from the spot in the 69th minute after Seamus Coleman had handballed in the area. The point for Swansea means they have equalled their best points haul in the Premier League (47), while Everton are now four games unbeaten and safe in mid-table after being just four points above the relegation zone in February. Swansea have coped superbly since losing their top goalscorer Wilfried Bony to Manchester City for £28m, largely thanks to the goals from Bafetimbi Gomis. Aaron Lennon of Everton celebrates scoring the opening goal against Swansea The striker had scored three goals in his last two games and came close to opening the scoring on 12 minutes, twisting Phil Jagielka on the edge of the area before hitting a fine strike that was heading for the top corner until Tim Howard intervened with a fine one-handed save. However, that chance came at a cost as Gomis tweaked his hamstring when shooting and had to be replaced by Marvin Emnes. Swansea continued to press on and had the ball in the back of the net courtesy of a wonderful 30-yard volley from Shelvey, but referee Michael Oliver had already blown for a foul on Leighton Baines before Shelvey received the ball. Coleman tested Lukasz Fabianski with a stinging 25-yard drive on 33 minutes and that seemed to spark Everton into life as they were ahead seven minutes later. James McCarthy was the instigator and creator of the goal, linking up brilliantly with Arunda Kone down the left after a quick passing move before sending a good cross into the box. Steven Pienaar was inches away from connecting but waiting behind him was Lennon, who took a touch and coolly prodded the ball home from eight yards. Having previously scored just one goal in his last 66 appearances, Lennon has now bagged two goals in three games for his new club. Swansea came out with more purpose after the break and levelled on 69 minutes. Emnes and Coleman battled for the ball on the left hand side of the area and it looked as though the Swansea man pushed the Everton defender to the ground. However, nothing was given by the referee and Coleman, whilst on the floor, scooped the ball away with his hand and a penalty was given. Howard tried to delay the penalty being taken by time-wasting and was booked but Shelvey, who was sent off when the two teams met at Goodison Park earlier this season, confidently sent the goalkeeper the wrong way.

"James Ward-Prowse scored his first-ever Premier League goal from the penalty spot as Southampton beat Hull 2-0 at St Mary's. The England Under-21 international struck just before the hour mark after Shane Long had been fouled in the area by Alex Bruce. Pelle then struck his first league goal of 2015 as the Saints recorded a comfortable victory that lifted them up to fifth, while the result sees Hull teetering precariously in 17th place in the table, just above the relegation zone. James Ward-Prowse says he is delighted to finally score his first goal for Southampton James Ward-Prowse says he is delighted to finally score his first goal for Southampton Southampton had a great chance within seconds of kick-off through Long who found himself clean through inside the first minute but stumbled over his first touch and failed to test Steve Harper in the Hull goal. The Tigers were soon on top, though, and Sone Aluko had two chances to put his side ahead - first an effort he scuffed wide when presented with the ball just inside the Saints area, and second when he fired straight at Kevin Davis after carving himself out a decent opening. But it was Pelle who spurned the best chance just before the midway point in the half. Long managed to win possession in the area before the ball found its way to his Italian strike partner. Six yards out, however, he could only hit Harper - who reacted impressively to close down the angles. Southampton boss Ronald Koeman says his team will fight until the end to get the highest position in the table Southampton boss Ronald Koeman says his team will fight until the end to get the highest position in the table The game gathered pace as the half went on and Southampton started to dominate, especially in the middle of the park where the excellent Morgan Schneiderlin pulled the strings alongside Victor Wanyama - who managed to pick up his 10th booking of the season, which will see him ruled out for the next two games. Saints continued to boss the game after the break and just before the hour mark they were in front, Ward-Prowse converting his penalty superbly past Harper after Long had been needlessly fouled by Bruce after bursting into the area. Steve Bruce was left frustrated after his Hull side could not find the first goal whilst on top Steve Bruce was left frustrated after his Hull side could not find the first goal whilst on top Harper was only in goal because Hull boss Steve Bruce decided to drop Allan McGregor - who had saved the last three Premier League penalties he had faced and was on the bench. Southampton continued to dominate and, with just less than 10 minutes left on the clock, they put the game beyond Hull through Pelle - who struck from close range after some excellent work from Schneiderlin. Steven Davis could have made it three late on, but for Southampton it was three well deserved points that saw them equal their total from the whole of last season. SOCCER SATURDAY VERDICT – Alan McInally Alan McInally says Hull really struggled after conceding from a penalty against Southampton Alan McInally says Hull really struggled after conceding from a penalty against Southampton \"Steve Bruce says Pelle should have been sent off but I don’t agree. He hits Bruce with his left arm square in the mouth but I genuinely think it was unintentional. A yellow card was maximum. He would have been very unlucky to be sent off. \"It was a difficult day for Alex Bruce. He took a couple of bangs in the face but – and I agree with Steve on this one – he can’t make the challenge on Long. In the first half Hull were pretty good. Livermore brought a brilliant save out of Davies, Aluko has a chance, Quinn with a volley, Chester has one headed off the line… they hadn’t played that badly. But the penalty changes everything on 56 minutes. \"Hull had genuine opportunities to score. I feel for them. But Southampton didn’t play that fantastic.\" Player Ratings Southampton: K.

Stadium of Light. Yannick Bolasie scored a hat-trick, becoming the first Palace player in Premier League history to achieve the feat, with Glenn Murray getting the other as the visitors plunged the Black Cats back into the Premier League relegation mire. Reaction from Glenn Murray and Yannick Bolasie, who describes his hat-trick as a 'dream come true' Reaction from Glenn Murray and Yannick Bolasie, who describes his hat-trick as a 'dream come true' Connor Wickham scored a late consolation but few Sunderland fans had stayed around to see it after the Eagles blew their side away in the opening stages of the second period. Firstly, Murray continued his fine goalscoring form with a thumping header at the far post, his sixth goal in as many games. He had initially flicked on a long ball before darting to the far post, arriving just in time to convert Bolasie’s deflected shot. Two minutes later and Bolasie was on the scoresheet himself, another long ball was flicked on by Murray and the winger ran clear to stab past Pantilimon in the Sunderland goal. No sooner had the away supporters settled down from that and they were celebrating again as Bolasie got his second with a delicate lob over Pantilimon. Once again a long ball undid the hosts. They allowed it to bounce and Bolasie stole in. Crystal Palace boss Alan Pardew says his side could have scored more as they beat Sunderland 4-1 Crystal Palace boss Alan Pardew says his side could have scored more as they beat Sunderland 4-1 His hat-trick came just after the hour. Murray made it as he bullied John O’Shea off the ball before squaring to Bolasie. The DR Congo international went past Pantilimon, stumbled and then swept the ball into the empty net as two Sunderland defenders desperately attempted to get the ball clear. It came after a fairly even first half in which Sunderland started brightly with Jermain Defoe heavily involved as they pressed for an early goal. Off the ball Dick Advocaat’s side were impressive in their pressing and harrying of Palace who struggled to get a foothold in the game. However, they slowly grew into the game with Bolasie and Jason Puncheon, in particular, coming to the fore. Sunderland boss Dick Advocaat says his side could not handle the pace of Crystal Palace Sunderland boss Dick Advocaat says his side could not handle the pace of Crystal Palace The away side may even have had a man advantage after Jack Rodwell was lucky to escape a red card for a lunging tackle on James McArthur. Alan Pardew was incensed on the touchline but referee Anthony Taylor judged it to be worthy of only a booking. From that point on the game became consumed by niggling tackles and the game lost the flow of the early stages. With Palace having started to gain the upper hand that suited Sunderland. Chances were few and far between but Bolasie delivered two very dangerous low crosses into the Sunderland box that required Lee Cattermole to mop up and at the other end Scott Dann had to be alert to cut out Billy Jones’ cross after good work from Connor Wickham saw him receive the ball in space down the right. Soccer Saturday verdict - Paul Merson Paul Merson says Crystal Palace played superbly against Sunderland, comparing them to the legendary Harlem Globetrotters Paul Merson says Crystal Palace played superbly against Sunderland, comparing them to the legendary Harlem Globetrotters \"First half there was nothing in it. Rodwell should have been sent off; it wasn’t the best of tackles and when you see it in a replay you think ‘yeah, he should have gone’. But the ref only gets one look at it. \"But second half, from the 48th minute to the 53rd it was 3-0. The worrying thing for me is when Sunderland go, they go. They’ve got no body on the pitch who goes ‘we’re 1-0 down, ride it out for 10 minutes and we’ll get a point’. They completely go, make the game open. \"Palace played in the Brazil kit and they were unbelievable. Sunderland played into their hands and Palace were so quick on the break. Bolasie, a few years ago I thought ‘stop doing tricks, beat players’ and he does that now. A hat-trick in the Premier League for a winger is phenomenal. \"Sunderland didn’t give up – Wickham got a consolation.

Gabby Agbonlahor could have doubled Villa’s advantage when he hit the woodwork in first-half injury time but, despite seeing midfielder Carlos Sanchez sent off late on, the visitors held on to earn a vital win in their battle for survival.

Christian Benteke says Tim Sherwood has given everyone at Aston Villa a boost of confidence Christian Benteke says Tim Sherwood has given everyone at Aston Villa a boost of confidence Tottenham had won their previous five Premier League games against Aston Villa but, in Sherwood’s first clash against his former team since being sacked as manager last year, it was the visitors who made the brighter start, with Michel Vorm forced to punch clear Benteke’s header. Spurs slowly grew into the game, with Federico Fazio heading Andros Townsend’s corner over and Danny Rose drawing a good stop from Brad Guzan after Ciaran Clark had been forced off with a knee problem. However, it was Villa who made the breakthrough on 34 minutes, when Benteke - who scored a hat-trick in the 3-3 draw with QPR on Tuesday - glanced Leandro Bacuna’s inviting cross into the far corner.

There was still time for Fabian Delph to bend a free-kick narrowly over the bar, as Sherwood’s men finished a productive first-half on the front foot.

First Vlaar headed wide at the back post, before sub Andreas Weimann shot tamely at Vorm. Delph then wasted a golden opportunity to put the game beyond doubt when he was sent clear by Benteke. The England midfielder delayed his shot too long and Vorm eventually made a smart save.

Albion appeared to have strengthened their own survival hopes, while denting those of Leicester, when Darren Fletcher’s eighth-minute strike and Craig Gardner's deflected volley had given them a half-time lead despite David Nugent’s equaliser on 26 minutes. Robert Huth’s 80th-minute header levelled things up for the visitors who dominated the second half, but Vardy out-muscled Gareth McAuley, ran half the length of the pitch and fired past Boaz Myhill as Leicester claimed back-to-back victories in the league for the first time since September. Leicester boss Nigel Pearson gave his players credit for the way they came back to win 3-2 at West Brom Leicester boss Nigel Pearson gave his players credit for the way they came back to win 3-2 at West Brom Albion wore a commemorative replica kit from the 1968 FA Cup Final in memory of former striker Jeff Astle and in aid of the Jeff Astle Foundation, a foundation set up to help ex-footballers with brain disease. Having been led onto the field by members of Astle’s family, Albion raced into an early lead as Fletcher’s near-post header was deemed to have crossed the line by goal-line technology, despite Esteban Cambiasso’s desperate clearance. Fletcher was the lynchpin in the opening exchanges as he controlled the tempo and pace of the game for an Albion side clearly intent on bouncing back from last weekend's 4-1 defeat to Queens Park Rangers. However, they were stung as Leicester rallied and equalised against the run of play as Nugent rounded off a direct move to collect Leonardo Ulloa’s flick and guide the ball past Myhill. Tony Pulis says the goals West Brom conceded against Leicester were of a lower-league standard following their 3-2 defeat Tony Pulis says the goals West Brom conceded against Leicester were of a lower-league standard following their 3-2 defeat It was then the visitors' turn to have the momentum yet fail to capitalise on it as Albion went in to the lead six minutes later. Chris Brunt’s cross caused chaos among the Leicester defence, before the ball dropped to Gardner to volley home with the help of a nick off Wes Morgan. Leicester then wasted their best chance of the half as Ulloa inexcusably fired Nugent's neat flick over the bar from six yards. Nigel Pearson’s brought on Marcin Wasilewski for Ritchie de Laet at the interval as the Foxes opted for a 3-5-2 formation, and it paid off as they controlled large swathes of the second period. It looked as though it would be yet another fruitless yet determined display from Leicester as they struggled to create clear-cut openings on the Albion goal. Charlie Nicholas says Leicester's dramatic win against West Brom will make all of their relegation rivals very nervous Charlie Nicholas says Leicester's dramatic win against West Brom will make all of their relegation rivals very nervous Saido Berahino selfishly opted to shoot when team-mates were better positioned in Albion's notable chance of the half and they were punished as Leicester left it late to snatch the points. Nugent’s floated ball across the face of goal was headed goalwards by Huth and helped over the line by Craig Dawson, who made a disappointing attempt at a clearance. And, when the game appeared to be destined for a draw, Vardy won a personal battle with McAuley, before producing a stunning individual winner. Despite victory, Leicester remain bottom, but move to within three points of safety, while Albion stay 14th on 33 points.

Aaron Cresswell's sweet seventh-minute free-kick had looked like it was going to be enough to secure a Premier League victory for the Upton Park hosts, but Stoke are nothing if not dogged. The pressure mounted in the home defence as the clock wound down and Arnautovic had already seen two efforts chalked off before he embarked on one final surging run and slid the ball across Adrian into the bottom corner. After having an earlier effort ruled out for offside, Marko Arnautovic was delighted to score a late equaliser for Stoke in their 1-1 draw with West Ham After having an earlier effort ruled out for offside, Marko Arnautovic was delighted to score a late equaliser for Stoke in their 1-1 draw with West Ham The result leaves both teams safely ensconsed in mid-table where they began the day - West Ham in ninth and Stoke in 10th. Enner Valencia was looking lively on his return from injury and won a free-kick 25 yards out in a central position after seven minutes. Mark Noble shaped to take, but stepped over the deadball and left it to Cresswell who curled the ball past the flat-footed Asmir Begovic. Stoke's defence were sitting very deep and struggled to get any support up to Jon Walters. Cheikhou Kouyate found room for a shot to keep Begovic honest, while Valencia almost crept in at the back post after a lung-bursting 50-yard run from Diafro Sakho. Mark Hughes says Stoke showed all the qualities he wants from a team Mark Hughes says Stoke showed all the qualities he wants from a team Charlie Adam - seemingly looking to replicate last week's effort at Stamford Bridge - was going for goal from distance at any opportunity but the accuracy was sorely lacking. Walters cut in from the left and slid a low shot towards the near post, the ball ending up in the side netting and Victor Moses fired wide as Stoke found some momentum just before the break. West Ham had lost their early urgency and Arnautovic thought he had levelled when collecting a fine weighted pass into the area from Adam and slotted past Adrian first time, only for the offside flag to be raised. Sam Allardyce says West Ham have thrown away seven points from their last nine games Sam Allardyce says West Ham have thrown away seven points from their last nine games At the other end, Kouyate's angled drive was pushed behind while a re-energised Stoke went close again on 80 minutes as Mame Biram Diouf's header crashed back off the inside of the post. Arnautovic thought he had equalised in the 92nd minute when converting from Stephen Ireland's assist, but again the assistant's flag was up quickly - and correctly. It looked like the jig was up but Arnautovic had other ideas; he held off two defenders as he bustled into the right side of the penalty area, before deftly sliding the ball across Adrian into the far corner for an unlikely - but ultimtately deserved - point..

thrilling 3-3 draw against Premier League relegation rivals QPR. The striker levelled to complete his treble with just seven minutes left after QPR looked to have done enough to climb out of the bottom three and leapfrog Villa. Winger Matt Phillips had handed the visitors a shock lead early on, heading home Bobby Zamora's cross. But the advanatage didn't last long thanks to the first of two goals from in-form striker Benteke before half-time. Aston Villa's Christian Benteke said his side were better than QPR Aston Villa's Christian Benteke said his side were better than QPR The first came via a deflection off Steven Caulker three minutes after Phillips' opener, before he calmly slotted home on the counter-attack to hand Tim Sherwood's men the lead just after the half-hour mark. Rangers then turned the game on its head as Clint Hill scored for the first time in the Premier League before Charlie Austin bagged his 17th goal of the season. However, Benteke rescued a point with a brilliant free-kick seven minutes before the end as the hosts moved three points clear of the drop zone while Rangers climbed to third bottom, still two points from safety. Jack Grealish made his first league start for Villa as the fit-again Ron Vlaar and Tom Cleverley returned along with Leandro Bacuna and Kieran Richardson. QPR's Eduardo Vargas, out for the season with a knee injury, and Yun Suk-young, sidelined with a head injury, were replaced by Niko Kranjcar and Hill. Charlie Austin: Thought he had won the game for the visitors Villa boss Tim Sherwood had predicted a full-blooded attacking game and Rangers, lifted by their second away win of the season at West Brom on Saturday, fulfilled their part in a breathless first half by opening the scoring after seven minutes. Austin's cross was not cleared and Zamora picked up the pieces to centre for Phillips to nod in unmarked from six yards. QPR boss Chris Ramsey admitted his side were disappointed with a draw QPR boss Chris Ramsey admitted his side were disappointed with a draw Yet Villa levelled just 151 seconds later when Fabian Delph played in Benteke and the striker was given too much time to cut in from the left before his shot deflected off Caulker and past Rob Green. The 'keeper then gathered Grealish's free-kick as the game reached break-neck speed before the youngster wasted a glorious chance on 16 minutes. Benteke was set free on the left and when Caulker failed to deal with the cross Green saved at the feet of Grealish. Villa had recovered from the early setback and were now well on top, with Sandro blocking Vlaar's stinging volley. And they completed their first-half comeback when Benteke grabbed his second after 33 minutes. Carlos Sanchez's tackle on the edge of his own box fell to Gabby Agbonlahor to send Benteke clear. Aston Villa boss Tim Sherwood was disappointed that his side conceded 'scruffy' goals Aston Villa boss Tim Sherwood was disappointed that his side conceded 'scruffy' goals The striker still had to run the length of the half but he cut inside Hill and sent Green the wrong way with a magnificently composed finish from 16 yards. Agbonlahor then glanced a header inches wide as Villa looked for a killer third but it never came and they paid the price 10 minutes after the break. Rangers had offered little threat since going behind but Hill headed in his first top-flight goal from Phillips' corner after out-muscling Ciaran Clark. Deflated, Villa were ragged as they began to give Rangers hope and Brad Guzan saved Austin's snap-shot on 63 minutes. The teams looked to be running out of steam before conjuring an epic finale when Austin edged Rangers ahead with 12 minutes left. Again, Phillips was involved as he wriggled free on the right and found the forward in space to rifle under Guzan from seven yards. But Benteke clawed Villa back again five minutes later when he curled in a 25-yard free-kick off the post after Charles N'Zogbia had been felled by Hill.

Glenn Murray says Crystal Palace's win over Man City was a great night for the club Glenn Murray says Crystal Palace's win over Man City was a great night for the club Yaya Toure responded for the visitors at Selhurst Park, but it was Alan Pardew's men who held on to claim another big scalp and virtually guarantee their place in the top flight for next season. Defeat leaves City nine points behind Premier League leaders Chelsea, who have a game in hand, with the small matter of the Manchester derby to come on Sunday. So poor is their current form - three defeats in five matches - that City have suddenly found themselves as the team Liverpool and Tottenham will be eyeing up as they attempt to steal fourth spot and, unthinkably, deny them a Champions League place. Alan Pardew says Crystal Palace showed resilience, character and diligence to defeat Man City Alan Pardew says Crystal Palace showed resilience, character and diligence to defeat Man City By contrast it was another big scalp and a memorable night for Palace, whose revival under manager Alan Pardew shows no sign of letting up. The hosts gave City a warning that this would not be a routine assignment in the opening seconds when Martin Kelly whipped the ball in behind City's defence. Puncheon slid in but could not get a touch and Wilfried Zaha, also at full stretch as he arrived at the far post, could only lift the ball over the top. It was a big chance and the miss almost proved costly when Sergio Aguero fashioned City's first opportunity, racing onto Joe Hart's long clearance and rounding Julian Speroni. Glenn Murray of Crystal Palace celebrates scoring the opening goal With the angle too tight to shoot, Aguero squared the ball to David Silva but Palace keeper Speroni got back to deflect the shot over with his shoulder. Manuel Pellegrini says Manchester City were unlucky not to have scored more goals Manuel Pellegrini says Manchester City were unlucky not to have scored more goals Aguero took matters into his own hands moments later, shifting the ball to make space on the edge of the area and beating Speroni with his shot, only to see it come back off the foot of the post. With the pressure building a goal seemed inevitable, but when it came it went to Palace. Joel Ward pumped the ball back into the danger area after City had cleared a corner, Joe Ledley flicked it on and Dann's shot was blocked by Hart only for Murray to tap in the rebound for his fifth goal in as many matches. City furiously appealed for offside, claiming both Dann and Murray were beyond the last man, but the flag stayed down and skipper Vincent Kompany's lengthy protest to referee Michael Oliver proved in vain. City shocked by Palace City shocked by Palace But if there were question marks about the first goal, there was nothing wrong with the second three minutes after the interval. Murray was barged over 25 yards out and Puncheon stepped up to curl a stunning free-kick over the wall and beyond the despairing dive of Hart. City's frustration grew when they had appeals for a penalty waved away after the ball appeared to strike Murray's hand in the area. Toure's ferocious curler 12 minutes from the end halved the deficit but they could not find an equaliser, with the final whistle sparking wild celebrations in south London - and probably parts of west London as well.

Fresh from winning his first caps for England, Kane was given the armband by Mauricio Pochettino in the absence of Hugo Lloris but it was another English striker, Ings, who looked in the mood early on. With just five minutes on the clock he raced through on goal after Boyd had done brilliantly to dispossess Ryan Mason deep in Tottenham territory. Nabil Bentaleb flirted with bringing down the striker as he raced towards goal but Ings stayed on his feet to get his shot away.

Ings did create a chance for himself on 45 minutes when he worked space 25 yards from goal, but his curling effort was tipped over the crossbar by Vorm. Kane had just 22 touches in the opening 45 minutes – the least of any Tottenham player, which summed up the struggles Spurs had getting the ball into dangerous areas.

Tottenham head coach Mauricio Pochettino said he was left disappointed after his side failed to make many chances against Burnley Tottenham head coach Mauricio Pochettino said he was left disappointed after his side failed to make many chances against Burnley Kieran Trippier was a constant source of imagination down the right for the hosts and his cross on 61 minutes caused minor panic in the Tottenham box, with Vlad Chiriches inadvertently chesting the ball back to Vorm under pressure by Ashley Barnes. Christian Eriksen blazed Tottenham’s best chance over the bar on 68 minutes, one of 10 attempts that the visitors hit off target during the course of the game. Pochettino threw on Andros Townsend in the closing minutes but it was Burnley that carried the bigger threat. With the clock ticking down, the hosts could have grabbed what would have been a huge goal in their battle to avoid relegation, but Boyd could only head wide from eight yards out. Thierry Henry's Super Sunday verdict: \"It’s a vital point for Burnley. If I had said to you at the beginning of the season, they would have a draw at Chelsea, drew just now against Tottenham, beat Man City and they have Arsenal coming soon, it’s a good result at the end of the day.

"Jermain Defoe’s moment of first-half brilliance in the Wear-Tyne derby sent Sunderland to a fifth straight win over Newcastle and three points clear of the relegation zone. Sunderland dominated Newcastle from the first whistle but it took until the 45th minute for the deadlock to be broken and it was sure worth the wait as Defoe fired a superb left-foot volley into the top corner.

Jermain Defoe won the Tyne-Wear derby with one of the best volleys ever scored in the Premier League. Dick Advocaat’s men continued to pile on the pressure during the second half but could not find a second goal and they were nearly made to pay as Remy Cabella forced Costel Pantilimon into action for the first time in the match. The hosts dropped deep in the closing stages as they looked to protect their lead as Ayoze Perez went close but that was all the visitors could muster as Sunderland once again went onto claim the Wear-Tyne bragging rights and a huge boost in their fight for Premier League survival. Sunderland are unbeaten in their last seven Premier League games against Newcastle but this fifth win will have felt especially sweet. Thierry Henry says Jermain Defoe's goal was a wonderful strike but his movement and anticipation also played a crucial role. Thierry Henry says Jermain Defoe's goal was a wonderful strike but his movement and anticipation also played a crucial role. With all three sides below them picking up points this weekend it was vital Sunderland responded in Advocaat’s first home game in charge and they were the dominant force in the opening stages of the 140th league meeting between the two sides. However, it was Newcastle with the first real attack and they thought they should have had a penalty after Santiago Vergini’s challenge on Perez. Referee Mike Dean remained unmoved and it was Sunderland who took control of the game from here on in with the visitors needing the returning Jonas Gutierrez to turn Billy Jones' cross over his own bar after Seb Larsson’s corner. Jermain Defoe admitted that his match-winning strike against Newcastle was one of the best of his career. Jermain Defoe admitted that his match-winning strike against Newcastle was one of the best of his career. Newcastle were struggling to get out of their own half as Sunderland pressed forward at every opportunity and they nearly had the lead, but a combination of the post and Jack Colback kept Connor Wickham’s header out. Defoe then raced through on goal in the 37th minute but his touch let him down at the vital moment and Tim Krul kept out Wickham’s shot minutes later. But with the half-time break looming, Defoe produced a piece of brilliance to break the deadlock. The ball was punted long into Newcastle territory and Steven Fletcher leaped highest to grab a flick-on. With the ball dropping from the sky, Defoe hit a blistering volley past Krul and into the top corner to send the Sunderland faithful wild. John Carver says Newcastle were 'abysmal' John Carver says Newcastle were 'abysmal' The emotion was too much for Defoe as he appeared to be close to tears leaving the field but there were no tears in the stands as the party atmosphere continued long into the half-time interval. Sunderland continued to pile on the pressure at the start of the second half and a confident Defoe was pulling the strings as his pass found Jordi Gomez, who crossed the ball to Fletcher, but the forward failed to make a decent connection with his shot. The second biggest cheer of the afternoon was reserved for Colback as the former Sunderland man went into the book after leaving his leg in on Gomez. Dick Advocaat says Sunderland's work ethic and commitment were crucial to their victory in the Tyne-Wear derby. Dick Advocaat says Sunderland's work ethic and commitment were crucial to their victory in the Tyne-Wear derby. Advocaat’s men were starting to enjoy their work and Defoe was in the thick of the action again, clipping the ball into the path of Patrick van Aanholt. The full-back took the ball forward and hit a powerful left-foot shot that failed to trouble the Newcastle goalkeeper. Sunderland were struggling to wrap things up and when the ball broke to Cabella in the penalty area in the 78th minute the Sunderland fans would have been forgiven for thinking the worst, but Pantilimon was on hand to make a smart save. Larsson was next to spurn a glorious opportunity for the hosts after excellent work down the left from Van Aanholt and then Vergini’s header was kept out by a scrambling Newcastle defence. The home side started to drop deep in the final 10 minutes to protect their lead and it nearly cost them. Daryl Janmaat’s flick-on found Perez at the far post and the striker hooked his leg over the ball, but not enough as it sailed into the stands - much to the delight of the home fans. Five minutes of added time buoyed Newcastle and goalkeeper Krul was sent up in the final seconds for a corner, but Sunderland held on to claim a vital victory in the race to beat the drop. The win moves Advocaat’s side up into 15th on 29 points, three clear of Burnley, who held Spurs to a 0-0 draw, in 18th.

Three goals in the final eight minutes of the first half stunned Liverpool as Hector Bellerin’s curled strike on 37 minutes, Mesut Ozil’s exquisite free-kick three minutes later and Alexis Sanchez’s thunderous effort on the verge of half-time took the game away from Brendan Rodgers’ side. Jordan Henderson converted a penalty 15 minutes from time after Raheem Sterling was brought down by Bellerin but Emre Can’s dismissal for a second bookable offence 10 minutes later all-but ended the contest. Olivier Giroud bagged his seventh strike in six Premier League games in stoppage-time with a well-taken, left-footed effort as Arsenal moved up to second in the table. Bellerin's exquisite effort opened the scoring The result, which leaves Arsenal four points behind leaders Chelsea, is the Gunners’ seventh consecutive league victory as well as their seventh consecutive win in all competitions. Liverpool, who suffered back-to-back defeats for the first time since November, remain fifth, five points adrift of Manchester United having played a game more. Despite the recent scrutiny surrounding his contract negotiations, Rodgers started Sterling, but it was the absence of captain Steven Gerrard and Martin Skrtel, who both started three-match bans, which had the greater impact as the visitors made a nervy start. Sterling had frustrating afternoon at the Emirates Santi Cazorla drew a fine save from Simon Mignolet with just three minutes on the clock and the Belgian was called into action two minutes later to deny Aaron Ramsey after Kolo Toure was dispossessed. The Ivorian, however, was on hand to atone for his initial error as he denied Cazorla converting the rebound. Having weathered the early Arsenal onslaught, Liverpool began to dictate the pace of the game and created two gilt-edged chances to take the lead. After being put through on goal by Philippe Coutinho, Lazar Markovic opted to square the ball to Sterling but his pass was ill-judged and over-hit allowing Arsenal to clear. Sterling then squandered a chance himself as he dragged a shot past the target having done well to shake off Laurent Koscielny’s challenge. Having kept his side in the game in the opening exchanges, Mignolet was helpless as Arsenal struck three times before the break. Emre Can saw red for clumsy foul on Danny Welbeck First Bellerin cut in off the right flank, stepped inside Alberto Moreno’s weak challenge before producing a fine left-footed strike to break the deadlock. It was two three minutes later as Ozil, who returned to the starting line-up after recovering from illness, found the same corner of Mignolet’s goal with a stunning free kick from 25 yards. Sanchez blasted Arsenal’s third in emphatic style on the stroke of half-time as his half-volley whistled past Mignolet before nestling in the back of the net. The Gunners created the first clear chance of the second half 10 minutes after the interval but Mignolet was on hand to palm Giroud’s effort over. Olivier Giroud celebrated his seventh goal in six games His opposite number, David Ospina, was called into action for the first time two minutes later as Can’s near-post effort was tipped out for a corner. Liverpool were then handed a glimmer of hope when referee Anthony Taylor penalised Bellerin for a clumsy foul on Sterling, and Henderson's strike from 12 yards escaped Ospina’s clutches. But hopes of a comeback were dashed when Can, who had seen yellow for a challenge on Cazorla and subsequent dissent, lunged in on substitute Welbeck and was sent from the field. Giroud was not to be denied as he rifled home the fourth from the edge of the area in the closing stages.

Andy King came off the bench to give Leicester City's survival hopes a huge lift as his late winner secured a 2-1 victory over West Ham at the King Power Stadium. Esteban Cambiasso had fired in a brilliant half-volley with just 12 minutes on the clock but David Nugent missed the chance to double the advantage, his penalty saved by Adrian, and Cheikhou Kouyate instead equalised for the Hammers after 32 minutes. Kouyate went close to scoring his second after the break but struck the post and West Ham were made to pay when substitute King pounced with just four minutes remaining. The win was Leicester’s first in the Premier League for almost three months and means they are now just four points from safety with eight games remaining, five of which are at the King Power. Cheikhou Kouyate beats Kasper Schmeichel. The home fans got behind their team in a frantic opening as Leonardo Ulloa fired over the bar and Riyad Mahrez had a cross cut out. Leicester’s positive start paid off after 12 minutes as Nugent's prod forward bounced off the back of James Collins and sat up nicely for Cambiasso to thunder home from 25 yards. It looked as though the hosts would double their advantage shortly afterwards as Carl Jenkinson conceded a penalty for bringing down Ulloa in the box. But Nugent’s poor spot-kick was saved and the momentum then seemed to turn in West Ham's favour. David Nugent steps up to take the penalty. Kouyate forced a good save from Kasper Schmeichel before Kevin Nolan headed wide from Stewart Downing’s cross. An equaliser looked to be coming and it eventually arrived when Alex Song chipped a ball into the box and Kouyate fired into the corner. The hosts struggled to muster much of a response before the interval but started the second half positively. Robert Huth glanced a header wide from a Cambiasso free-kick and Marc Albrighton - on at the break for Mahrez - was just unable to connect on the stretch with a Jamie Vardy cross. Vardy then saw a couple of decent chances go wide, the first a header and the second a shot from a decent position. Leicester manager Nigel Pearson freshened his attack again by introducing Andrej Kramaric for Ulloa, but West Ham were starting to impose themselves once more as the game opened up. Downing dragged an effort wide and Kouyate hit the woodwork before bringing a save out of Schmeichel with a curling shot. However, Leicester fought back admirably and after Kramaric had a shot cleared off the line, he sent the ball towards Vardy, whose shot was diverted in from close range by King for the winning goal.

Herrera’s low finish gave United the lead just before half-time after a dominant opening 45 minutes and Wayne Rooney’s superb strike 11 minutes from time doubled their lead. But though Christian Benteke provided a scare when he pulled one back within a minute of Rooney's volley, Herrera grabbed his second of the match to seal victory in stoppage-time. It was a sixth Premier League win in succession for United and puts more pressure on City, who take on Crystal Palace on Monday Night Football before a huge Manchester derby clash with United next weekend - also live on Sky Sports. United began in confident mood and had a huge penalty appeal turned down inside five minutes as Marouane Fellaini met a long ball over the top and played in Rooney, who went down under Ciaran Clark’s challenge. The defender looked to have an arm around the United man but referee Roger East waved away the appeals, much to Rooney’s frustration. Undeterred, United continued to dominate possession although clear-cut chances were not regularly forthcoming until the 23rd minute, when Marcos Rojo’s 35-yard piledriver was turned over by Brad Guzan. Louis van Gaal says his side were not patient enough following their 3-1 win against Aston Villa and were lucky they scored at the right moment. Louis van Gaal says his side were not patient enough following their 3-1 win against Aston Villa and were lucky they scored at the right moment. United’s pressure eventually paid off just as the home fans were starting to become frustrated. On 43 minutes Daley Blind’s low pass into the box was met by Herrera, who contolled with his right before firing past the Brad Guzan to give the hosts a deserved half-time lead. Hosts dominant It was a familiar pattern after the break as Villa continued to struggle to impose themselves on the game, Ashley Young missing a good chance to double United’s lead as he cut in from the left and curled a 20-yard effort inches wide of the far post. Wayne Rooney scored a sublime second for the hosts Fellaini, who grew increasingly frustrated as the wide men regularly fell short with their delivery, then spurned a glorious chance, nodding a header into the ground which Guzan turned over the bar. And it was not until the closing stages that the hosts finally breached the Villa defence once again. Substitute Angel Di Maria raced down the left and fired in a cross, which Rooney brought down with a sublime touch before swivelling and volleying a thunderous effort past Guzan. It looked to be game over, but within 60 seconds Villa were back in it as Joe Cole’s low corner was met by Benteke, whose shot drew a rare mistake from David De Gea as it squirmed under the United goalkeeper to give Tim Sherwood’s men a lifeline. Tim Sherwood says it was disappointing Aston Villa were defeated 3-1 by Manchester United after remaining in the game after conceding two goals. Tim Sherwood says it was disappointing Aston Villa were defeated 3-1 by Manchester United after remaining in the game after conceding two goals. But there to be no comeback, and two minutes into stoppage time United secured the points. Rooney was quicker to a drop-ball than Benteke and he set Juan Mata away down the right. The Spaniard pulled it back to the edge of the box for Herrera, who swept an excellent low finish into the bottom corner. Charlie Nicholas' verdict \"I think Manchester United made it difficult for themselves. Villa have good energy, they’re organised, but they never get their midfield players into a position to be a menace. Ashley Young was good today, Herrera as well, he enjoys playing with Mata. \"I thought Herrera was the star turn today. He’s very deliberate in what he does. I’m a big fan of midfield runners, who will stretch defenders and make them think. It creates space for the attack-minded players and he does that in a very calm way.\" Player ratings Man Utd: De Gea (6), Valencia (6), Jones (7), Rojo (7), Blind (7), Carrick (6), Herrera (8), Mata (7), Fellaini (6), Young (7), Rooney (7).

Ki Sung-Yueng had given the Swans the lead against the run of play after 18 minutes, before Bafetimbi Gomis acrobatically doubled the Welshmen’s lead on 37 minutes. Hull pulled one back through Paul McShane’s close-range strike five minutes after the break, but their task was made even tougher when David Meyler saw red card for a reckless lunge on Kyle Naughton, who limped off as a result. Bafetimbi Gomis: Brilliantly scored Swansea's second Swansea looked in control from that moment on and made sure of the points in stoppage-time through Gomis, Garry Monk's side just two points off bettering their Premier League points record after another win. Steve Bruce’s men began the day just three points above the bottom three but looked like they were about to build on their spirited performance against Chelsea last time out after a bright start, without troubling Golden Glove-chasing Lukasz Fabianski in the hosts’ goal. But they could not make their possession count and after allowing Jonjo Shelvey far too much time to line up the shot, Alan McGregor could only parry the midfielder’s effort into the path of the onrushing Ki, who had the simple task of side-footing into the net from a six yards. Kyle Naughton: Had to be replaced after the tackle that saw David Meyler sent off The goal was a hammer blow to the Tigers, but they only had themselves to blame for going further behind. A corner was floated in from the right, but after several attempts, Hull could not get the ball clear and only diverted the ball into the path of Gomis, who brilliantly dispatched an overhead kick to double the home side’s lead. After the break, Hull again came out of the blocks and almost immediately got themselves back into the match. Phil Thompson gives his thoughts on Swansea's 3-1 win over 10-man Hull. Phil Thompson gives his thoughts on Swansea's 3-1 win over 10-man Hull. Robbie Brady curled a dangerous free-kick into the box, Alex Bruce got up first to flick the ball on, and McShane beat Fabianski to the ball to prod home to get the Tigers back in the contest. Then, just as the momentum seemed to have swung in the visitors’ favour, Meyler inexplicably lunged at Naughton, with his studs high, leaving referee Andre Marriner no choice but to brandish the red card. Abel Hernandez had a golden opportunity to get Hull back in it against the run of play, but he could not get the right connection when in acres of space in the box. And that miss proved costly as the excellent Gylfi Sigurdsson lofted the ball over the top to Gomis, who had the time and space to stride towards goal and loft the ball over McGregor to seal victory in the dying moments, and leave Hull with it all to do to ensure their survival.

Steve Bruce says Hull's 3-1 defeat to Swansea revolved around two key decisions - David Meyler's red card and Swansea's second goal. Phil Thompson's verdict: “It was a poor start to the game, both teams jousting in midfield to get control. It was boring, both keepers had nothing to do. Then bang, out of the blue, Jonjo Shelvey has a shot, McGregor parries it and Ki puts it in. 37 minutes, it’s 2-0, Gomis. A corner comes in, gets headed out, and when the ball comes back in, he’s actually in an offside position. But it goes on and he puts it in with an overhead kick. In the second half, we’re all thinking, ‘what is Steve Bruce going to do here?’ “I imagine Steve will be angry at the outcome (of the red card). Meyler has led with his wrong foot, right across with his left foot, and he catches the top of the ball which accelerates his movement into the shin of Kyle Walker.

The London side arrived in the Midlands having lost 13 of their 14 Premier League away games this season but raced into a 3-0 half-time lead thanks to goals from Eduardo Vargas, Charlie Austin and Zamora. Albion threatened a revival after the break and lively substitute Victor Anichebe pulled a goal back with just over half-an-hour remaining. But the hosts had Youssouf Mulumbu sent off just 11 minutes after he had come off the bench and an injury-time Joey Barton goal wrapped it up for QPR, who go 18th in the table - just a point from safety. Matt Le Tissier says QPR fully deserved their 4-1 win over West Brom at the Hawthorns. Matt Le Tissier says QPR fully deserved their 4-1 win over West Brom at the Hawthorns. There was little sign of the first-half fireworks to come in a fairly quiet opening 10 minutes but Brown Ideye then squandered a great chance to put the hosts into the lead, heading over the bar when he was left all alone at the back post to meet a Darren Fletcher cross. He was made to pay moments later when Vargas scored a cracking 15th-minute opener, latching onto an Austin flick-on ahead of Chris Baird, and then finding the corner of the net with a low right-footed shot from 25 yards out which flew past Boaz Myhill. Albion almost equalised just a few minutes later, a low Baird cross hitting Ideye and then bouncing inches wide of the post. Vargas then had to go off with a leg injury but his replacement, Niko Kranjcar, played a key role as the visitors doubled their lead eight minutes before half-time. Queens Park Rangers head coach Chris Ramsey believes they will need a minimum four points from their next two games to give themselves a chance of avoiding Queens Park Rangers head coach Chris Ramsey believes they will need a minimum four points from their next two games to give themselves a chance of avoiding Matt Phillips sent over a right-wing corner and Kranjcar got up well to flick the ball on at the near post, top scorer Austin applying the finishing touch with a diving header at the back post. Already reeling from the shock of seeing their side go two goals clear away from home, the QPR fans were celebrating again two minutes before half-time when Zamora conjured up a superlative goal out of nowhere. Phillips played the ball down the right-hand side and, from the corner of the area, Zamora produced an audacious first-time flick with the outside of his left-foot, which looped over Myhill and dropped perfectly under the crossbar. Some strong words may have been said in the West Brom dressing room at the break and they began the second-half with plenty of purpose, boosted by the introduction of Anichebe, who teed up Craig Gardner, only for the midfielder to side-foot his shot straight at Rob Green. Anichebe then pulled a goal back himself in the 58th-minute, beating Green with a fine header after Saido Berahino floated over a nice cross from the left. QPR were rocking and Green did well to save a deflected Ideye shot, before Berahino wasted a great chance to make it really interesting, nodding straight at the QPR goalkeeper from close range after an Ideye knock down. Ideye then put a diving header over the bar from a brilliant Chris Brunt cross but the hosts lost all their momentum when Mulumbu was red carded six minutes from time. QPR gave their Premier League survival hopes a boost with a stunning 4-1 victory at West Brom. QPR gave their Premier League survival hopes a boost with a stunning 4-1 victory at West Brom. The midfielder appeared to catch Barton with his arm as they challenged for a header and, although it seemed clumsy rather than malicious, referee Lee Probert had no hesitation in showing a straight red. Probert had turned down a pair of plausible QPR penalty appeals for handball in the second half but his final key intervention meant they were able to cruise through the closing stages. And they wrapped up a second away win of the season in the fifth minute of stoppage time, when Austin made a nuisance of himself in the box, West Brom failed to clear, and Barton raced in to latch on to the loose ball, which he gleefully smashed past Myhill. Having looked in massive trouble, QPR will now head into a huge game at Aston Villa on Tuesday night in good heart, while West Brom remain on 33 points, and will feel they need one more win to assure themselves of Premier League football next season. Matt Le Tissier's verdict: \"As soon as the first goal went in, West Brom looked a little bit vulnerable. Vargas scored the goal, with a brilliant strike from outside the box, and the confidence that gave QPR was visible. The third goal was an absolutely superb goal - Bobby Zamora probably has not scored many better goals than that in his entire career. \"West Brom got a goal back but QPR looked fairly comfortable after Mulumbu was sent off.\" Player ratings West Brom: Myhill (6), Baird (6), McAuley (6), Lescott (5), Brunt (7), Sessegnon (5), Fletcher (5), Gardner (5), Morrison (6), Ideye (7), Berahino (5).

Eden Hazard gave Chelsea the lead from the penalty spot in the 39th minute after Philipp Wollscheid’s late challenge on Cesc Fabregas, but they were pegged back by one of the goals of the season. Adam produced arguably one of the best goals in Premier League history from inside his own half to catch Thibaut Courtois off his line and give Stoke a lifeline just before the break. Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois fails to keep out a 59-yard 'worldy' strike from Stoke's Charlie Adam But Chelsea, who lost second-half substitute Diego Costa to another hamstring injury, responded as Hazard pounced on Asmir Begovic’s error to give Loic Remy a tap in. The win means Chelsea are just 16 points away from Premier League glory and it moves them seven points clear of nearest rivals Arsenal, eight ahead of Manchester United and nine better than Manchester City, who play Crystal Palace in the Monday Night Football. With the chasing pack closing the gap at the top of the table earlier in the day, Chelsea looked to make a fast start and nearly had the lead inside three minutes as Remy’s deflected shot looked to be nestling into the far corner only for Begovic to scramble across and claw the ball to safety. The Blues were dominating possession and it looked only a matter of time before they broke the deadlock as Remy raced into the penalty area, but his low shot was once again well saved by Begovic. Jose Mourinho was disappointed with Diego Costa's latest hamstring injury but said the decision to play him was a risk worth taking. Jose Mourinho was disappointed with Diego Costa's latest hamstring injury but said the decision to play him was a risk worth taking. The home side seemed to be in the mood and continued to press forward, but they were given a warning midway through the first half as Nemanja Matic’s poor clearance fell to Steven N’Zonzi, but his curling shot sailed over the crossbar. However, normal service was resumed minutes later as the influential Hazard skipped away from three Stoke defenders on the edge of the penalty area before firing a low shot straight at the 'keeper. Chelsea finally made the breakthrough in the 39th minute after Wollscheid caught Fabregas late in the penalty area. The referee pointed to the spot and up stepped Hazard to score his 12th league goal of the season. Charlie Adam shoots from 59 yards out to score against Chelsea Jose Mourinho’s side, who are the only team in the four divisions of English football who have not lost a home match in the league this season, would have thought they were well on the way to all three points but the home fans were stunned minutes before the break when Adam produced a moment of brilliance from long range. The 29-year-old picked up the ball inside his own half, looked up and powered an effort towards goal which had Courtois scrambling backwards. The Belgian got a hand to the ball but could not keep it out of the net as Adam wheeled away to celebrate his 50th goal in English football. Stamford Bridge was silenced and Mourinho gambled by sending for Costa at half-time as Chelsea came out with renewed vigour. John Terry says Chelsea must continue to grind out results and not give their title rivals any hope. John Terry says Chelsea must continue to grind out results and not give their title rivals any hope. Hazard, who was at the heart of everything for the Blues, cut inside on his left foot and fired a powerful shot towards the top corner which Begovic parried around the post. The Bosnia and Herzegovina international was called into action again minutes later when Glenn Whelan got a touch on Willian’s free-kick, but the sprawling Begovic somehow manage to keep it out. Mourinho’s side’s task became even harder when Costa, who was an injury doubt coming into the match, pulled up clutching his hamstring and was replaced by Didier Drogba. Here's your chance to see the goal that's got everyone talking: Charlie Adam's superb strike against Chelsea. Here's your chance to see the goal that's got everyone talking: Charlie Adam's superb strike against Chelsea. It was a huge blow to Chelsea but they showed the character of potential champions to get their noses in front as Hazard pounced on a poor throw from Begovic to run in on goal, before squaring the ball to Remy to tap into an empty net. Stoke were not done yet though as N’Zonzi went within an inch of levelling things up again, but his shot from 20 yards hit the outside of the post. Chelsea could have made all three points safe with just 10 minutes remaining when Hazard found substitute Juan Cuadrado five yards out from goal, but he could not beat Begovic, who produced a brilliant double stop. Diego Costa limps off against Stoke There was to be one final chance for Mark Hughes’ men in added time as a long throw into the box caused confusion in the home defence but Marko Arnautovic fired wildly over the bar to secure Chelsea a vital win the race for the title.

Raheem Sterling set Jordan Henderson away down the right flank, and the midfielder fired an excellent early ball around the visitors’ defence for Sturridge. The striker had a chance to shoot but decided to lay off for the late run of Lallana, but his England team-mate could only drill his first-time effort wide of the target from 18 yards. That chance brought the crowd into action and Liverpool started to enjoy more time inside the United half, but Van Gaal’s men nearly doubled their lead right before the break as Michael Carrick fired a speculative effort from 25 yards, nearly catching Mignolet out, but the goalkeeper managed to keep it out. Dramatic red Gerrard was introduced for Lallana at the break as Rodgers looked for some experience in midfield, but 38 seconds after coming on the captain was dismissed as, after flying into a challenge on Mata, he went in for another on Herrera and appeared to stamp down on the United midfielder, prompting a straight red from referee Martin Atkinson. Steven Gerrard: Admitted he let his manager and team-mates down Steven Gerrard: Admitted he let his manager and team-mates down Liverpool's response was purposeful and Philippe Coutinho drilled a long-range effort just over the crossbar, but they soon found themselves further behind as Mata grabbed his second in the 59th minute. The Spaniard squared the ball inside to substitute Angel Di Maria, who returned it with a delightful chipped pass which Mata drove past Mignolet with a spectacular acrobatic volley. Daniel Sturridge celebrates after making it 1-2. Liverpool managed to haul themselves back into the contest 10 minutes later, however, when Coutinho drove through the middle and found Sturridge, who drove the ball inside the near post aided by a deflection off Phil Jones. Both sides enjoyed spells of possession as the game twisted and turned, with tempers flaring all over the pitch – substitute Mario Balotelli spared a second yellow card for an altercation with Chris Smalling after picking up an earlier booking for a challenge on Jones. Louis van Gaal: Pleased with first half performance Louis van Gaal: Pleased with first half performance The visitors were given the chance to kill the game off in stoppage time when Daley Blind got past Emre Can in the box and went down under the defender’s challenge, but Rooney’s shot to the left was easily parried away by Mignolet. It would not affect the result of the match, which ended on a sour note as Martin Skrtel caught De Gea with a late challenge and the pair squared up, but United took the victory to end Liverpool’s unbeaten run and move five points clear of their rivals. Gary Neville's verdict He's on for more reasons than one, Steven Gerrard. His one on Mata was a crunching challenge but I think he might have been stupid here; he'll know from the experience that he has. It's the emotions sometimes, when you're playing a fixture like this.

Chelsea ran into a 2-0 lead within nine minutes through Eden Hazard’s 25-yard strike and Diego Costa’s fine finish from an angle. But two quick-fire goals from Hull brought them level before the break, Ahmed Elmohamady turning home from close range before Thibaut Courtois’ poor touch allowed Abel Hernandez to net the equaliser. Steve Bruce says Hull's performance against Chelsea shows they are ready for the challenge Steve Bruce says Hull's performance against Chelsea shows they are ready for the challenge Despite Hull going close on several occasions in the second half, substitute Remy grabbed the winning goal from 12 yards just two minutes after coming on. The result keeps Hull three points clear of the drop zone with eight games to play, while Chelsea stay top by six points over Manchester City with a game in hand. Chelsea had won just two of their last six games in all competitions going into the clash, while Hull had lost just one of their last six in the league. But the Premier League leaders were ahead after just 79 seconds through Hazard, who collected the ball 45 yards out and drove forward before unleashing an unstoppable left-footed effort past Allan McGregor. Diego Costa scores Chelsea's second goal after nine minutes Hull were nearly level just minutes later, but Courtois stood tall to keep out Hernandez after the Hull striker was put through on goal. Chelsea went 2-0 up on nine minutes through Costa, curling home from an angle after being found on the left by Cesc Fabregas. Jose Mourinho says Chelsea’s 3-2 win at Hull was very important Jose Mourinho says Chelsea’s 3-2 win at Hull was very important Dame N’Doye tested Courtois again with a curling 25-yard free-kick, but the hosts halved the deficit and were then level with two goals in two minutes. First, Elmohamady turned home from six yards after being found by a fine ball across the face of Courtois’ goal on 26 minutes. Then, Courtois’ calamitous heavy touch from a Branislav Ivanovic back pass fell kindly to Hernandez, who slid into the empty net from 10 yards. Hull continued for the rest of the first half on top, posting 16 shots on Chelsea’s goal as they looked to complete a fine comeback before the break. Abel Hernandez scores into the empty net after Courtois' howler Chelsea looked more assured in defence in the second half, and nearly went ahead just five minutes in through Fabregas, but the Spaniard’s effort across goal fell a yard wide. Courtois made up for his earlier mistake with a fine triple save with 25 minutes remaining, keeping out Elmohamady and Jake Livermore’s resulting rebound, before tipping over Gaston Ramirez’s effort as the ball bounced to the midfielder inside the area. Remy entered the field with 75 minutes on the clock to replace Costa, who was seen holding and stretching his hamstring, and the Frenchman made an instant impact two minutes later. Collecting Willian’s centre, Remy’s effort from 10 yards squirmed under McGregor’s grasp to give Chelsea all three points.

Roberto Martinez says Everton gave a fantastic performance to win 2-1 at QPR and praised his side's defending throughout the game. Roberto Martinez says Everton gave a fantastic performance to win 2-1 at QPR and praised his side's defending throughout the game. Lennon restored Everton’s lead in the 77th minute and this time the Toffees held on as Adel Taarabt fired against the bar in injury time. Rangers have now lost five home games in a row for the first time in the club’s history and remain second from bottom. The result places extra significance on their next two matches at West Brom and Aston Villa while Everton can start looking up the table as they climbed up to 13th and eased their relegation worries. Joey Barton returned to captain Rangers after serving a three-match suspension while Everton made just one change from the side that beat Newcastle, with John Stones coming in for Antolin Alcaraz. The home side started the match on the front foot, but it was Everton who went closest to breaking the deadlock in the early stages as Leon Osman shot over the bar from a corner. The visitors looked dangerous on the break and they took the lead following a well-worked counter attack after 18 minutes. Osman passed the ball out for Coleman in space on the right and he produced a fine finish as his shot flew across goal and went in off the far post. The goal came against the run of play but Rangers should have levelled 10 minutes later as Bobby Zamora headed wide from inside the six-yard box. The chance was QPR’s best of the half as Everton started to see more of the ball and continued to look threatening on the break. But the hosts went close to equalising just a minute after the break as Junior Hoilett curled a shot against the crossbar. Mauricio Isla then made a good challenge to stop Osman shooting at the other end before Rangers grabbed the equaliser in the 64th minute. Everton failed to clear Joey Barton's corner and in the ensuing chaos the ball ended up with Vargas, who smashed the ball into the roof of the net from close range. The hosts could have made it two soon after when Zamora broke free of Phil Jagielka but he fired over the bar from just outside the area. The missed opportunity proved costly as the Toffees restored their advantage in the 77th minute. Coleman's cross was half-cleared by Nedum Onuoha under pressure from Arouna Kone, but the ball fell straight to Lennon, who side-footed home for his first goal in an Everton shirt. The goal seemed to knock the stuffing out of Rangers but there was still one final chance in injury-time as a long ball up-field spilled out to Taarabt. The Moroccan's shot looked destined for the far corner but instead it clipped the bar and sailed over to send the home supporters away deflated again.

Wilfried Bony’s first Manchester City goal helped the champions beat 10-man West Brom 3-0 after Gareth McAuley’s erroneous early dismissal at the Etihad Stadium. City were handed the initiative after two minutes when referee Neil Swarbrick sent off McAuley instead of Craig Dawson in a case of mistaken identity after the latter brought down Bony, who was through on goal. First-half strikes from Bony and Fernando put City two up at the break, before David Silva’s effort 13 minutes from time secured the points against a spirited Baggies side. Wilfried Bony: Notched first City strike Sergio Aguero was thwarted on numerous occasions by Baggies goalkeeper Boaz Myhill, who took a starring role in keeping the scoreline respectable. Manuel Pellegrini says there’s no point worrying about Chelsea’s results Manuel Pellegrini says there’s no point worrying about Chelsea’s results The result saw City ease some of the mounting pressure on manager Manuel Pellegrini - in his 100th game in charge - by closing the gap on league leaders Chelsea to three points, while West Brom remain 13th after the defeat. Having seen their domestic and European quests for silverware take a blow with successive 1-0 defeats to Burnley and Barcelona, Pellegrini opted to freshen up side with six changes. Bony was handed his first start in three games, and it was his persistence in the opening exchanges which forced the Albion defence, and then the referee, into an early error. With just over a minute on the clock, the Ivorian pounced on McAuley’s under-hit backpass and was challenged by last-man Dawson. The Northern Irishman then tackled Bony inside the area before the referee brought the play back and brandished the red card to the wrong man. The incident was the second case of mistaken identity in under a month, following Wes Brown’s dismissal at Old Trafford on February 28. Frank Lampard was called up to the starting line-up for the first time in two months he spurned his side’s first real opening as his sliced an effort from 18 yards wide 20 minutes in. Fernando celebrates scoring Man City's second goal Unsurprisingly, City dominated possession and had the host of chances to break the deadlock but Myhill was on hand to deny Silva. The pressure finally told on 27 minutes when Bony seized on Dawson’s and Craig Gardner’s indecision to gather the ball before coaxing it into the top left-hand corner of Myhill’s goal. It was his first goal since New Years’ Day when he netted in Swansea’s 1-1 draw at QPR. A barrage of City attacks ensued as Navas’ neat turn and shot inside the area drew Myhill into another eye-catching save before it was two shortly before the break. Summer acquisition Fernando grabbed his second goal for City, having scored his first in a 3-1 victory at the Hawthorns in December. The Brazilian punished Jonas Olsson’s and Myhill’s hesitancy in the area to prod home from close range on 41 minutes. Saido Berahino misses the target from close range. City continued their relentless push for a third after the break but Myhill proved impenetrable as Aguero was denied from three yards. Bony and Aguero hit the woodwork as their efforts struck the post and cross bar in quick succession. Albion rallied and spurned a glorious opportunity to halve the deficit when Saido Berahino headed Olsson’s flick over onto the bar and then over the target from close range before Silva wrapped up the points. Substitute Stevan Jovetic did well to fashion a yard and get a shot away but Silva was on hand to get the decisive touch to deflect it into the back of the net.

Gomis latched onto Jefferson Montero’s cross with three minutes remaining after the Frenchman had missed a host of chances for the visitors. Tim Sherwood says his side looked the likelier to score in Aston Villa’s 1-0 defeat to Swansea, which is why the result is so difficult to take. Tim Sherwood says his side looked the likelier to score in Aston Villa’s 1-0 defeat to Swansea, which is why the result is so difficult to take. The result leaves Villa three points above the relegation zone with eight games left. Villa went into the game looking for a fourth straight win in all competitions, while Swansea, sitting pretty in mid-table, had lost their previous two. But Swansea had most of the chances in the first half, the majority falling to Gomis. The Frenchman forced a fine save from Brad Guzan after six minutes from six yards after being found by Neil Taylor, and the American had to be at his best again later in the half, blocking Gomis’ left-footed effort from 10 yards. Guzan’s stops nearly counted for nothing just before the break when the Villa goalkeeper fumbled a Gylfi Sigurdsson cross, but Ciaran Clark cleared Wayne Routledge’s resulting effort off the line. Villa's run of three straight wins was ended by Swansea at Villa Park Lukasz Fabianski was tested just once in the opening 45 minutes, the Polish stopper doing well to keep out Fabian Delph’s driven effort from the angle. Villa came out for the second-half the brighter, but Gabriel Agbonlahor’s effort on the swivel trickled wide of Swansea’s goal. Swans boss Garry Monk brought winger Montero on with 25 minutes remaining, and the Ecuadorian instantly caused Leandro Bacuna problems down the right. Montero’s cross found Gomis 12 yards out with 15 minutes remaining, but his goal-bound effort was superbly blocked by Clark. However, it was Montero’s next delivery with the outside of his foot as Swansea broke that found Gomis six yards out, the striker poking home under Guzan for the winner. Swansea nearly doubled their lead late on when Routledge broke free, but Guzan stood tall to keep it out. Villa pressed in the closing stages with three corners, but Swansea held on to keep Villa rooted in a survival battle. Charlie Nicholas' verdict: This was a very enjoyable game. I wasn’t expecting many goals and I certainly wasn’t expecting as many chances as were created by both sides. Swansea were excellent again in the first half. Gomis had a host of chances to score before his late goal Gomis in particular had three good opportunities. Guzan’s kicking wasn’t great today but his reactions were very, very good. Second half, Villa were much better. As every chance was falling to Gomis for Swansea, every chance was falling to Sinclair for Villa. It was like a shootout between the two. It was Gomis who came up with it. The finish will get all the credit but set up play was fantastic, it was a beautiful crafted bit of play.

2-1 and move within four points of leaders Chelsea. The Frenchman diverted Santi Cazorla’s free kick home before heading in a corner from the Spaniard, but Moussa Sissoko pulled one back in a second-half resurgence from the hosts. Ayoze Perez and Yoan Gouffran both had opportunities to rescue a point, while David Ospina kept out Mike Williamson’s header, but Arsene Wenger’s side held on to record their sixth Premier League win in succession, maintaining any outside hopes for the title but strengthening their grip on a top-four spot. John Carver says he was delighted with his players’ valiant performance against Arsenal, but was disappointed with the goals they conceded. John Carver says he was delighted with his players’ valiant performance against Arsenal, but was disappointed with the goals they conceded. It is a third-straight defeat, meanwhile, for John Carver’s men, whose terrible record against Arsenal continues as they lost a seventh game in succession against the Gunners. Newcastle had the better of the early exchanges as Wenger’s men looked nervous in the opening stages, but the hosts couldn’t carve out any decent chances; Ayoze Perez’s blocked effort their best opening. Aaron Ramsey had Arsenal’s first decent chance as he latched on to Giroud’s flicked ball through the defence, but the Welshman’s attempted flick around Tim Krul rolled harmlessly off target. But Giroud soon opened the scoring as the visitors won a free kick towards the right-hand side in the 24th minute, and Santi Cazorla’s whipped ball in was headed on by Danny Welbeck before the striker met the ball with his knee to turn it past Krul and into the net. Things quickly got worse for the hosts as Giroud bagged his second of the match within four minutes, Cazorla again the provider as this time he fired in a corner which the Frenchman headed across goal and into the bottom far corner. Pressure The hosts came flying out of the blocks for the second half, and three minutes in they were right back in the game as Remy Cabella played a one-two with Perez before pulling back to Sissoko, who drilled the ball low into the net from 15 yards out. Perez then nearly fired Newcastle level a minute later as he cut inside from the left before curling a wonderful effort which flew just wide of Ospina’s far post. Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud praised his sides resilience after holding on to beat Newcastle 2-1 at St James' Park. Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud praised his sides resilience after holding on to beat Newcastle 2-1 at St James' Park. Arsenal were on the ropes and it looked like a matter of time before Newcastle found the equaliser but Gouffran spurned a glorious opportunity on the hour. The Magpies saw penalty appeals turned down as Perez’s cross hit Calum Chambers’ arm, but play went on and it fell for Gouffran, who could only fire straight at Ospina. The goalkeeper was soon called into action again as the hosts won a corner, and Mike Williamson powered a header at goal which Ospina turned away with a magnificent reflex stop. Moments later Daryl Janmaat drilled wide from distance, while Welbeck had a chance to alleviate the pressure at the other end, but he could only force a corner off Tim Krul from a tight angle. As time ran out, Ospina again proved the hero as he turned away Perez’s low effort with another good save, and the visitors held on to take their sixth win in succession to put themselves right up there with the top two. Matt Le Tissier's verdict Matt le Tissier says that Arsenal should have made light work of Newcastle after going two goals ahead, but Newcastle’s resurgent second half performance m Matt le Tissier says that Arsenal should have made light work of Newcastle after going two goals ahead, but Newcastle’s resurgent second half performance m It should have been a bit more comfortable for Arsenal. Going 2-0 up in less than half an hour, they were so much on top that you thought it could have been any kind of score. Newcastle were looking a little bit disorganised at that point but they didn’t kick on and it was still just the two at half time. They didn’t make Tim Krul make too many saves after that. Newcastle came back strongly after half time and got a goal just after half time – it was a cracking goal too. At that point you thought ‘game on’ and Newcastle gave it a really good go, Ospina had to make a couple of good saves, one from Perez and then from a very close-range flick header from Sissoko. It should have been more comfortable than it was but Arsenal still ground out the three points and are in a very good position.

Shane Long grabbed his first Premier League goal for 14 games before a Jason Shackell own goal rubberstamped the victory on a bittersweet afternoon for Saints, who had Fraser Forster stretchered off with a serious-looking knee injury. Burnley played with their usual gusto as both Danny Ings and Sam Vokes were denied in the first-half by substitute goalkeeper Kelvin Davis but Saints created the better chances with Graziano Pellè and Steven Davis rattling the crossbar. Sean Dyche says his side missed way too many good chances in their 2-0 defeat to Southampton Sean Dyche says his side missed way too many good chances in their 2-0 defeat to Southampton The hosts were dealt a huge blow inside 10 minutes as the in-form Forster went down after a routine clearance from a back pass. As he went to punt the ball clear his left knee seemed to buckle and he signalled to the bench straight away that something was seriously amiss. He was stretchered off and was taken straight to hospital. His replacement Davis, who was making his first Premier League appearance since New Year’s Day 2014, was called straight into the action as he denied Sam Vokes from 10 yards with a superb block. Burnley continued to provide most of the attacking spark and George Boyd wanted a penalty on 24 minutes after Jose Fonte caught his trailing leg in the box but referee Anthony Taylor was unmoved. Southampton’s build-up was impressive to watch but a killer finish was lacking as the crowd began to get a tad restless with their side, who had only scored one goal in their previous home matches. Fraser Forster of Southampton is substituted after picking up an injury Pelle, who hasn’t scored in the Premier League for 12 games, bore the brunt of their groans but it was his mis-kick that played a part in the opening goal on 37 minutes. Nathaniel Clyne fired a strike at goal from the right hand side of the box and Pelle completely duffed his kick from eight yards but lucky for him, Long was waiting at the back post to stab home. The goal triggered a crazy ten minutes of football with both teams creating numerous chances. Pelle was the first to miss, smashing a very presentable effort against the crossbar from six yards after a Fonte knockdown before Ings broke up the other end and drew another great save from Kelvin Davis. Clyne then fizzed a deflected shot inches wide of Tom Heaton’s far post and just seconds later Steven Davis rose to meet a Dušan Tadic cross but the ‘keeper tipped the ball onto the crossbar. Southampton's Sadio Mane and Burnley's David Jones vie for possession There was still time in the first-half for Vokes to test Kelvin Davis from 12 yards with a firm header after good work from Ings. Southampton manager Ronald Koeman made a switch at half-time to counter Burnley’s attacking nous by bringing on holding midfielder Victor Wanyama for the attack-minded Tadic and it worked a treat as the visitors were restricted to half-chances as Wanyama and Morgan Schneiderlin bossed the midfield from then on. After the tactical switch, Saints were the side creating all the chances and doubled the lead on 58 minutes when Shackell got himself into a muddle in his six-yard box and diverted a fizzed in Ryan Bertrand cross into the net. Burnley never gave up in the closing stages but lacked the quality in the final third to create any real pressure on a superb Southampton defence that has conceded just 21 goals all season - the best defensive record in the league. The victory puts pressure on both Manchester United and Liverpool before their clash at Anfield tomorrow in the race for Champions League qualification while Burnley remain in the bottom three. Ronald Koeman says the 2-0 victory over Burnley is the best birthday present he could have hoped for, but the Dutchman could be without Fraser Forster afte Ronald Koeman says the 2-0 victory over Burnley is the best birthday present he could have hoped for, but the Dutchman could be without Fraser Forster afte Soccer Saturday reaction: Paul Merson “It was a difficult game for Burnley and it was in the balance for a while. After Long scored, Southampton got on top and they should have got a second, Pelle misses an absolute sitter. Burnley go up the other end and it falls to Ings and then Davis make a worldie save. \"Davis came on for Forster, it was out of nothing. He went to kick the ball and his knee gave way. Davis came on and made two or three good saves. They had their chances as they always do when they go away from home. “I was impressed with Southampton. I thought they were really good, they passed the ball around second half. Bertrand was absolutely outstanding, he gave Trippier a torrid time. Shackell couldn’t do much about the own goal but after that Burnley never looked like scoring. For the first time that I’ve seen them this season they looked tired.\" All the action from the day's Premier League matches brought to you by Jeff and the rest of the Soccer Saturday boys.

"Wilfried Zaha got the winner as Crystal Palace claimed an entertaining 2-1 win at Stoke Wilfried Zaha celebrates after scoring what turned out to be the winner Crystal Palace’s fine form under manager Alan Pardew continued as they secured a 2-1 win at Stoke after a pulsating afternoon at the Britannia. The hosts took the lead through Mame Biram Diouf but Palace then struck twice in quick succession at the end of the first half, Glenn Murray scoring from the spot before Wilfried Zaha shot home to earn Pardew a fourth win in five away games. Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew says he was delighted with his team's character during their 2-1 win over Stoke City. Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew says he was delighted with his team's character during their 2-1 win over Stoke City. Incredibly, there were no more goals in a pell-mell second-half, with Julian Speroni outstanding in the Crystal Palace goal. And defeated Stoke were left to rue two contentious decisions from referee Andre Marriner, who gave a spot-kick against the hosts in the first-half and then denied them one of their own after the break. Stoke made the better start and a neat back-heel from Stephen Ireland set up Charlie Adam, who put a curling effort just wide of the post. And the hosts then took a 14th-minute lead when Adam went for a goal with a free-kick from a long way out and his low shot hit Palace defender Damien Delaney, falling perfectly for Mame Biram Diouf, who produced a cracking first-time finish, flicking the ball past Julian Speroni. There was an element of luck in the goal but the hosts were making the running and they continued to control the game, albeit without creating any more clear-cut chances in the first half. However, the complexion of the match changed dramatically four minutes before half-time when James McArthur floated a speculative ball forward, Asmir Begovic collided with Yannick Bolasie in the box and, to the goalkeeper’s disbelief, ref Andre Marriner pointed to the spot. Begovic was possibly reckless in charging out but Bolasie’s foot was very high and the Stoke goalkeeper was booked for his vociferous protests. To compound his misery, Glenn Murray brilliantly converted the penalty, lashing his spot-kick high into the net, and Palace found themselves level despite having been up against it for most of the match. The goal seemed to unsettle Stoke, Adam and Erik Pieters following Begovic into the book in quick succession. And Palace then scored again with virtually the last kick of the half, Murray flicking on a long Speroni punt and Zaha pouncing as Pieters dithered, before shooting past the advancing Begovic. Stoke manager Mark Hughes was disappointed to not be awarded a penalty after what he believed was a deliberate handball Stoke manager Mark Hughes was disappointed to not be awarded a penalty after what he believed was a deliberate handball Inspired by their unlikely lead, Palace began an enthralling second half on the front foot, although McArthur blotted his copybook when he was booked for going down too easily in the box. Jason Puncheon then squandered a great chance to double the lead, blazing over the bar after a Zaha cross was half-cleared. And centre-back Scott Dann then produced a brilliant piece of skill on the edge of the box after a corner, before hitting the post with a low shot which took a slight deflection. However, Stoke then took charge, only to find Speroni in inspired shot-stopping form. Having already used his face to deny Diouf in unconventional fashion at the start of the half, the Palace keeper brilliantly denied Ireland after the midfielder had controlled a Marko Arnautovic shot and looked certain to level. Another big decision then went the way of Palace when Joel Ward hurled himself in front of a Diouf effort and appeared to block with his arm. No penalty, said Marriner. That man Speroni then came up trumps again, keeping out an Adam free-kick which had eluded everyone in the box and looked set to sneak into the corner of the net. And, although Stoke continued to dominate possession in the final quarter of an hour and pumped plenty of crosses into the box, Palace held firm, with Dann, Delaney and company outstanding in defence. Diouf put a late half-chance into the side netting and the visitors held out to claim yet another memorable win under Pardew, making it back-to-back league victories for just the second time this season.

three times against Leicester Harry Kane crowned a fine week with a hat-trick to become the Premier League’s top goalscorer and earn Tottenham a dramatic 4-3 victory over Leicester at White Hart Lane. The striker, picked for England for the first time on Thursday, tapped home from close range after just six minutes before doubling the lead seven minutes later with a scuffed effort into the far corner. Spurs - who lost goalkeeper Hugo Lloris to injury in the first minute - had been suspect defensively and conceded when Dave Nugent’s early cross was fired in by Jamie Vardy before half-time. Wes Morgan’s header just after the break hauled the Foxes level but Kane converted from the penalty spot to restore Spurs’ lead and then Jeff Schlupp's own goal seemed to put the game beyond doubt. Harry Kane delighted to round off memorable week with first Premier League treble Harry Kane delighted to round off memorable week with first Premier League treble Nugent volleyed into the near corner in the dying moments to set up a tense finish but Spurs held on to restore their top-four challenge and keep Nigel Pearson’s side in deep relegation trouble. Having selected Kane for the upcoming Euroepan Qualifier against Lithuania and subsequent friendly with Italy, Roy Hodgson watched from the stands as the 21-year-old scored his first ever league hat-trick and took his tally to 29 from 43 appearances this term. After Lloris was stretchered off just seconds into the game following a collision with teammate Kyle Walker, Kane found his opener when Foxes keeper Kasper Schmeichel parried an Eric Dier flick into his path. Leicester were a threat on the break, posing Walker and Tottenham’s right-hand side real problems, but it was the England right-back who helped set up Kane for his second with a low cross not cleared by Robert Huth. Spurs should have been 3-0 up inside 22 minutes when Christian Eriksen beat three players on the edge of the box and fired against the far post, with Nacer Chadli blazing the rebound over an open goal from close range. Tottenham head coach Mauricio Pochettino was proud to see his Tottenham team bounce back after defeat to Manchester United Tottenham head coach Mauricio Pochettino was proud to see his Tottenham team bounce back after defeat to Manchester United Pearson’s side, who knocked Tottenham out of the FA Cup at the Lane in January, were anything other than fazed and deserved to pull a goal back through Vardy after both Esteban Cambiasso and Nugent went close. And an equaliser was equally as merited; Morgan heading home powerfully five minutes into the second half without any resemblance of a Tottenham challenge. The visitors had chances to take the lead themselves and Huth should have done better with another free header inside the box, but Nugent was kicking himself after losing possession to Danny Rose inside his own box before pulling the defender over to concede a penalty on 64 minutes. Kane, who had been quiet in the second half, coolly found the left-hand corner and could have had a fourth and his 30th of the season with a late effort over the bar – a tally that has not been levelled by any Spurs player since Jurgen Klinsmann in 1995. Schlupp’s own goal proved to be the decider with Nugent volleying in Leicester’s third skilfully at the death, but Pearson’s side remain bottom of the division and without a win in eight Premier League games.

And it was Defoe – signed by previous boss Gustavo Poyet in January to score the goals to keep the club in the top flight – who was guilty of missing the best opening of the first half after being played clean through on goal by Steven Fletcher’s flick on the quarter-hour mark, only for the diminutive striker to blaze horribly off target. West Ham, meanwhile, played like a side who had failed to win any of their previous seven matches, a poor run that included losing their last two at Upton Park, in the opening period, with the nearest they came to scoring coming when Alex Song’s 25-yard volley forced Costel Pantilimon into a smart near-post stop. Sam Allardyce: Delighted to have kept a clean sheet Sam Allardyce: Delighted to have kept a clean sheet Other than that, however, the Hammers huffed and puffed, but barely looked like blowing the visitors’ house down, despite them producing 25 crosses before the break. After the interval it was much the same as Sunderland’s rear-guard, led impressively by captain John O’Shea, repelled all that West Ham could throw at them, while at the same time trying to catch their opponents on the break using the pace of Defoe. But all Advocaat and Co had to show for their attacking endeavours was left-back Patrick van Aanholt’s speculative effort from distance that Adrian turned behind for a corner with 13 minutes to go. And even the introduction of the returning Adam Johnson after 73 minutes, greeted by a predictable chorus of boos from the home fans, could not increase the Black Cats’ threat up front. Jamie Redknapp and Niall Quinn believe West Ham's win over Sunderland can kick start their season Jamie Redknapp and Niall Quinn believe West Ham's win over Sunderland can kick start their season As the minutes ticked by, however, so West Ham’s pressure began to build as Sakho glanced a header inches past the post, before two strong penalty appeals were turned down by referee Lee Mason. The Hammers were not to be denied a morale-boosting victory, though, and with just two minutes left a neat move on the edge of the Sunderland box involving substitute Nene and Mark Noble saw the latter’s lovely flick play Sakko through, with the Senegalese making no mistake by firing low past a helpless Pantilimon for his 10th league goal of the campaign.

"Henderson keeps Liverpool in race for the top four. Liverpool maintained their push for a top-four finish as Jordan Henderson's fortunate second-half strike sealed a 1-0 win at Swansea. Jordan Henderson: Pleased to secure three points Jordan Henderson: Pleased to secure three points The stand-in Liverpool skipper's 68th-minute strike proved to be the difference as Jordi Amat's deflected clearance struck the midfielder and looped over Lukasz Fabianksi. During a first half dominated by the hosts in terms of clear-cut chances, Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet produced a fine display to deny a string of well-worked Swansea attempts before the interval. Liverpool came out rejuvenated after the break and controlled large parts of the second period before deservedly taking the lead. Joe Allen: Delighted with hard-fought win Joe Allen: Delighted with hard-fought win Steven Gerrard made his long-awaited return from a hamstring injury and marshalled midfield as Liverpool kept their opponents at bay and held out for the points with the game meandering towards its conclusion. Brendan Rodgers brought Mamadou Sakho into his back four, but it was his captain, Henderson, who struggled to adjust to the pace of the game early on as he caught former Red Jonjo Shelvey with a high boot before seeing yellow for a foul on Neil Taylor. Bafetimbi Gomis returned to the Swansea line-up a fortnight after his fainting incident at Tottenham, and the Frenchman led the line brilliantly as Garry Monk’s side created the first clear chances. Monk: Disappointed that Swansea didn’t make more of their first half chances Monk: Disappointed that Swansea didn’t make more of their first half chances Having headed a Liverpool corner to safety and then beaten Emre Can, Gomis’ goal-bound run was only stopped by a strong Joe Allen tackle. Wayne Routledge’s follow-up cross then found Ki Sung-Yueng at the far post, but the South Korean couldn’t get his attempt on target. Mignolet then took a centre stage as he denied the hosts what would have been a deserved lead with a string of quality saves before the break. The first came on the half-hour mark when he denied Gomis’ low drive after Wayne Routledge’s neat one-two had put the striker through on goal. Rodgers: Aiming to secure top-four place Rodgers: Aiming to secure top-four place Gylfi Sigurdsson should have done better to find the target after Taylor had found him inside the area, but it was Mignolet who denied him moments later as launched himself to tip the Icelandic international’s effort out for a corner. Shelvey then came close with a well-worked set piece from a corner, but Adam Lallana’s last-ditch intervention proved vital as the Reds held on to enter the break level. The Merseysiders took full advantage of their let-off in the first half as they dominated the second period against a tiring Swansea side. Carragher wouldn't start Gerrard Carragher wouldn't start Gerrard Raheem Sterling got the better of Taylor on a number of occasions and almost turned provider as in got in behind the Swansea defence and laid the ball off to Philippe Coutinho, only for Fabianski to tip the effort onto the post. Gerrard replaced Alberto Moreno shortly after the hour mark and Rodgers’ subsequent reshuffle to his side produced the game’s defining moment. After receiving Martin Skrtel’s threaded pass, Sturridge’s flick into the path of Henderson ended up with Amat’s clearance cannoning off him and into the back of the net for a deserved, yet fortunate, opener. Carragher on Henderson's improvement Carragher on Henderson's improvement The goal knocked the stuffing out of Swansea who struggled to get back into the game as Liverpool equalled a club-record sixth consecutive away league game without conceding. Coutinho and Sterling had late attempts miss the target as the Reds went in search of the game-clinching second. Sturridge struck the post in the dying seconds but the result was in hand buy that point. The victory moves the Merseysiders into fifth - two points off rivals Manchester United ahead of their mouth-watering Super Sunday clash at the weekend, while Swansea remain ninth on 40 points.

Chelsea crept rather than motored away from Manchester City in the title race after drawing 1-1 with Southampton. Jose Mourinho’s men, who are now six points clear with a game in hand on City, took the lead through Diego Costa on 11 minutes but a Dusan Tadic penalty eight minutes later levelled the game. Plenty of chances were created and wasted by Chelsea with Southampton goalkeeper Fraser Forster in splendid form in the second half, repelling a Loic Remy effort away from goal in the dying minutes from which John Terry wasted the rebound. Costa was denied a penalty, but Mane was awarded one Diego Costa also hit a post for the hosts, who will have been frustrated not to have been awarded two penalties when Branislav Ivanovic was clipped in the first-half by Tadic and Costa went down under pressure from Jose Fonte. Chelsea started at a high tempo, pressuring the Southampton back four whenever possible and they opened the scoring on 11 minutes. Southampton goalkeeper Fraser Forster was named Man of the Match Southampton goalkeeper Fraser Forster was named Man of the Match Costa hadn’t found the net in the Premier League since grabbing Chelsea’s third goal in the 5-0 drubbing of Swansea in January but was on hand to power home an Ivanovic cross from eight yards with a thumping header. However, much like against PSG on Wednesday, Chelsea took their foot off the gas after taking the lead and had Thibaut Courtois to thank just one minute later as he denied Sadio Mane from close range. Undeterred by that missed chance, Mane came again at the Chelsea backline and won a penalty with his next attacking run. Jose Mourinho believes his side are in a better position in the Premier League despite only managing a 1-1 draw Jose Mourinho believes his side are in a better position in the Premier League despite only managing a 1-1 draw The Senegal international drove at the heart of the hosts' defence and only a lunging tackle from behind by Nemanja Matic could halt his progress. The Chelsea man, who was booked, got a foot on the ball but took the man first and Tadic duly dispatched the penalty, although Courtois did get a foot to the ball. Ivanovic then wanted a penalty of his own minutes later when he went down after Tadic had stood on the back of his heel, but referee Mike Dean was unmoved. Ronald Koeman was pleased with his players' character and the way they responded to going a goal down Ronald Koeman was pleased with his players' character and the way they responded to going a goal down Chelsea’s goalkeeper continued to be kept busier than Mourinho would have liked as he palmed away a firm Tadic drive from the edge of the box on 29 minutes before Shane Long’s continued pace in behind John Terry created a chance for Mane, who forced Courtois into another stop from the edge of area. Matic could have been sent off early in the second period after hauling down Mane 30 yards out but survived a second booking. Mourinho then withdrew the midfielder from the action, putting on Ramires in his place, and from then on Chelsea took charge of the game. Costa should have doubled his tally for the afternoon on 53 minutes but he diverted a Willian cross onto the post from just three yards out. Always at the heart of the game, Costa then had a penalty appeal waved away which was nearly identical to the one that was awarded to Southampton in first half as Fonte made a lunging tackle from behind as the Chelsea man ran deep into the penalty area. Forster then came to the fore in the final 25 minutes to repel wave after wave of Chelsea attacks. Diego Costa of Chelsea is frustrated after missing a chance. The England goalkeeper made a brilliant double stop to first deny Cesc Fabregas from eight yards and then was up quickly to divert Eden Hazard’s rebound away from danger. Oscar then tried his luck from 12 yards after a brilliant Fabregas pass but Forster made himself big and thwarted that effort before a Cesar Azpilicueta shot from the edge of the area was turned around the post by the Saints stopper. Chelsea saved their best chance until last though. Substitute Remy found himself in space eight yards from goal but his shot was blocked away by Forster. The ball rebounded to Terry, who smacked an effort goal-bound which was cleared off the line by James Ward-Prowse. After a couple of ricochets the ball broke back to Terry eight yards out but he fired a shot wide of the far post when it looked easier to score.

The win is a welcome relief for Everton manager Roberto Martinez after a disappointing run of results at home in the league. Antolin Alcaraz of Everton heads the ball The Toffees' previous victory Goodison in the league came when they saw off QPR 3-1 on 15 December, and they did show signs of nerves against Newcastle. The visitors started brightly and almost took an early lead as Gabriel Obertan's close-range shot was kept out by Tim Howard and Mike Williamson's follow-up was blocked by McCarthy. But Everton soon started to assert themselves and, after Lukaku tested Tim Krul with a couple of long-range efforts, it was McCarthy who broke the deadlock on 20 minutes. Martinez applauds Everton attitude Martinez applauds Everton attitude The midfielder still had some work to do after collecting Lukaku's lay-off but was assisted greatly by Krul who, despite having full view of the shot, dived the wrong way and watched as the ball went in past his outstretched feet. But Everton were unable to build on the goal and instead it was Newcastle who finished the half stronger. Sammy Ameobi had a couple of efforts blocked while Emmanuel Riviere should have done better after beating Howard to Moussa Sissoko's cross. Referee Martin Atkinson shows Fabricio Coloccini a red card Newcastle continued to look the better side after the break but the momentum swung firmly in Everton's favour as referee Martin Atkinson awarded a penalty and showed Coloccini a red card inside a decisive five-minute spell. Yoan Gouffran gave away the spot-kick after failing to clear the ball inside the area and then bringing down Lennon after he was tackled. Lukaku converted the penalty and it got worse for Newcastle minutes later as Coloccini dived in recklessly on Lennon and was shown a straight red card. Carver questions sloppy defending Carver questions sloppy defending Everton spurned chances to add to their advantage as Arouna Kone and Leon Osman were denied by Krul and Barkley had a shot blocked on the line by Ryan Taylor. And Newcastle came close to setting up a nervy finish as Howard produced a brilliant stop to keep out Sissoko’s shot and Antolin Alcaraz blocked Remy Cabella's driving run. But Everton made it 3-0 deep into injury-time as Christian Atsu played a ball through for Barkley and he rounded Krul and finished into the empty net.

Tottenham and performed a memorable celebration Wayne Rooney scored the third goal against Tottenham and performed a memorable celebration Manchester United dented Tottenham's top-four hopes while strengthening their own with a 3-0 win at Old Trafford thanks to three first-half strikes. United, who had lost to Spurs' north London rivals Arsenal in the FA Cup on Monday night at Old Trafford, were two up within 19 minutes through Maroune Fellaini’s fine finish from 12 yards and Michael Carrick’s precise header. Rooney added United’s third after a mistake in Spurs’ midfield, and celebrated by punching the air and falling to the ground in response to newspaper reports he had been \"knocked out\" by Stoke's Phil Bardsley in a boxing match in his kitchen. Rooney punches the air after his goal The result leaves Spurs six points off fourth-place United in the Premier League table, and means Louis van Gaal's side are now five points ahead of Liverpool, who travel to Swansea on Monday night. United came out of the blocks brightest and were ahead after just nine minutes after Carrick fed Fellaini in behind the Spurs defence. Fellaini had plenty to do from 12 yards, but the Belgian's left-footed effort across Hugo Lloris found the corner of the net. The striker then fell to the ground as if he was Provider Carrick then turned scorer 10 minutes later, heading superbly into the bottom corner through a crowd of players from 12 yards after Fellaini's header from a corner had been cleared by Nacer Chadli. Wayne Rooney says Manchester United produced their best half of the season Wayne Rooney says Manchester United produced their best half of the season United had plenty of joy down the left channels as Ashley Young, Daley Blind and Fellaini combined throughout the first half to the detriment of Spurs, forcing Mauricio Pochettino to substitute Andros Townsend for Moussa Dembele after just 30 minutes. But it was a mistake in Tottenham's midfield that led to United's third 11 minutes before the break, as Rooney capitalised on a wayward pass from Nabil Bentaleb. Louis van Gaal was pleased to see United make a 'big first step' in what he calls the 'top four rat race' Louis van Gaal was pleased to see United make a 'big first step' in what he calls the 'top four rat race' Picking the ball up with 45 yards to goal, the forward shook off Bentaleb before knocking the ball past Eric Dier and slotting beyond the reach of Lloris from near the penalty spot. The morning's newspaper reports clearly had not fazed Rooney, and he celebrated by pretending to be a boxer, jokingly punching the air and falling to the ground as if he had been knocked out. United kept up their intensity in the second half without ever testing Lloris in the Spurs goal, while Pochettino's side had to wait until the 48th minute for their first attempt.

Park, where the only positive for the visitors was a contender for goal of the season from Matt Phillips. Wilfried Zaha opened the scoring after meeting a low Yannick Bolasie cross at the back post and painfully collided with the upright for his troubles. The R’s were in disarray at the back, and Bolasie again was allowed too much room to cross for James McArthur to double his side’s lead five minutes before half-time. Then just three minutes later Joel Ward notched a rare goal to complete a miserable opening 45 minutes for QPR. Julian Speroni had one of his least eventful afternoons of the season in the Palace goal, until Phillips fired in an incredible strike from 45 yards out with 10 minutes left. The result sees Chris Ramsey’s side, who are currently four points adrift of safety, face an even tougher challenge to pull themselves out of the relegation mire, while Palace pulled further clear of the bottom three and now sit comfortably in 12th. James McArthur: Delighted with his strike After a cagey opening 20 minutes the deadlock was broken by Zaha, who netted for the first time in 25 appearances following great work from Bolasie. Racing down the left flank, Bolasie made space for the cross and fired low in front of Green and, under a challenge from Suk-Young Yun, the former Manchester United winger just sneaked the ball home, despite suffering a nasty collision with the upright. The returning Adel Taarabt was looking dangerous, and came close with a thunderous effort from distance, but QPR’s defensive vulnerability was again their undoing as McArthur made it two. Again Bolasie was allowed time and space to get the cross into the box, and in almost identical fashion as Zaha McArthur slid in to the double the Eagles’ lead. Things went from bad to worse as Zaha, causing havoc down the right flank this time, pulled the ball back for the advancing Ward who, with the aid of a deflection, beat the despairing dive of Green to put the hosts in a commanding position at the break. Wilfried Zaha: Just about notched opener It was the first time that Palace had scored three goals in the first half of a Premier League match in the competition’s history, and they didn’t really have to hit top gear to do so. The majority of the second half was little more than a procession, as Palace were content to run the clock down and see out the win. However, Phillips’ strike out of nowhere ensured an exciting finish. The midfielder had no right to even think about shooting from such a distance, but pulled out an extraordinary strike to put his side back in with a shout. Phillips came close to adding a second from a free-kick which was well saved by Speroni, but for fully 80 minutes QPR were comfortably second best, and have to improve quickly if they are to stay in the division.

win in a row as they moved to within one point of second-placed Manchester City with a 3-0 win over West Ham at the Emirates. France striker Giroud – who has now scored five times in his last five matches against West Ham – struck just before half-time and then combined with Ramsey on 81 minutes for Arsenal's second before linking up with Santi Cazorla, who teed-up fellow sub Flamini for a third six minutes from time. Olivier Giroud was pleased to get on the scoresheet against West Ham Olivier Giroud was pleased to get on the scoresheet against West Ham Arsenal’s win was their ninth in a row over their London rivals and, coupled with Man City's shock defeat to Burnley on Saturday Night Football, opens the door for a second-place finish. West Ham were out-played for much of the opening half – in which Theo Walcott missed three clear-cut opportunities – and although Sam Allardyce’s side improved after the restart they are now without a win in their last eight in all competitions. Arsenal had begun the week by beating Manchester United to reach the semi-finals of the FA Cup and started brightly against West Ham as they aimed to strengthen their position in the Champions League qualifying spots. The hosts should have been ahead with just five minutes on the clock when a clever flick from Giroud released Walcott in the box but he delayed his shot too long and referee Chris Foy then waved away penalty appeals when James Collins tumbled the forward without touching the ball. Alexis Sanchez then drew a fine save from Adrian – but Kevin Nolan demonstrated West Ham’s threat on the break when he connected with a Matt Jarvis cross and tested David Ospina with a powerful volley. West Ham assistant manager Neil McDonald believes his side let themselves down during set plays West Ham assistant manager Neil McDonald believes his side let themselves down during set plays At the other end, Giroud found the side-netting from a tight angle and Ramsey – making his first start in over a month – forced Adrian to tip the ball over the bar from Calum Chambers’ centre as Arsenal resumed control. Walcott then wasted a golden opportunity to break the deadlock, shooting tamely at the West Ham ‘keeper when clean through on goal before Mesut Ozil made the same mistake from close range and Walcott slipped as he tried to convert the rebound into an unguarded net. However, Arsenal weren’t to be denied a first-half advantage, as Giroud rifled a powerful left-foot shot into the top corner from 15 yards after neat build-up play between Ozil and Ramsey in the 45th minute. West Ham had lost their previous eight matches against Arsenal but made a positive start to the second half and Jarvis wasted a good chance to equalise when he fired over the bar from a Stewart Downing corner when well placed. Arsenal struggled to dominate the game as they had in the first half but could have doubled their advantage when Ozil found space in the box, however, the Germany international opted to cross rather than shoot and Ramsey’s subsequent volley flew wide. The Wales midfielder was on target on 81 minutes, though. After playing a smart one-two with Giroud, Ramsey finished in style from just inside the West Ham box. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger was pleased with his side's 3-0 win over West Ham Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger was pleased with his side's 3-0 win over West Ham Just three minutes later Arsenal had the ball in the net again as sub Cazorla exchanged passes with Giroud before picking out Flamini at the back post, who tapped in with one of his first touches of the game. Sub Danny Welbeck – fresh from warming up alongside fourth official Anthony Taylor, who replaced injured ref Foy – then saw a late header saved, but by then Arsenal had comfortably secured all three points. Soccer Saturday - Matt Le Tissier's verdict: \"Arsenal were very comfortable in the end, though they were not ruthless enough in front of goal in the first half. \"Second-half, West Ham came out right after half-time and gave it a real go, without really testing Ospina much. In the end, they committed a few more men forward and got caught on the break. \"But the quality of Arsenal's goals today was outstanding.There was some fantastic little one-touch play around the box.\" Player ratings Arsenal: Ospina (7), Chambers (7), Koscielny (7), Mertesacker (7), Monreal (7), Coquelin (7), Ozil (7), Ramsey (8), Sanchez (6), Walcott (6), Giroud (8).

they were held to a 0-0 draw at the King Power Stadium by a Hull side who had to play with 10 men for the last 20 minutes. Midfielder Tom Huddlestone was sent off when he received his second yellow card in the 72nd minute but Hull held on for a point and will feel they were the team who should have won the game. Nikica Jelavic somehow missed a fantastic first-half opportunity and then sub Abel Hernandez squandered a chance to grab a late winner. Leicester City midfielder Matty James ensures fans they will do everything to escape the drop Leicester City midfielder Matty James ensures fans they will do everything to escape the drop However, the visitors are now six points clear of the drop zone while the games are running out for bottom club Leicester, who are seven points from safety. Desperate for three points from a winnable home fixture, Leicester produced plenty of first-half endeavour but struggled to create clear-cut chances, Michael Dawson and his fellow defenders proving resolute in the Hull back-line. The visitors looked the classier outfit and carried the greater goal threat but Jelavic produced an incredible miss in the 20th minute. Huddlestone picked out Ahmed Elmohamady with a lovely floated pass and the industrious Egyptian winger unselfishly cushioned the ball into Jelavic’s path, only for the forward to somehow miss his kick with the goal gaping. Jelavic did shoot home five minutes later but the referee had already blown up, Dame N’Doye having barged into Mark Schwarzer as the veteran goalkeeper gathered a cross. Leicester City manager Nigel Pearson was disappointed with their 0-0 draw against Hull City Leicester City manager Nigel Pearson was disappointed with their 0-0 draw against Hull City Schwarzer had kept his place despite the return to fitness of Kasper Schmeichel, who was on the bench, and the Aussie was fairly untroubled in the opening period, as was Hull keeper Allan McGregor. Andrej Kamaric showed off a nice bit of skill before shooting wide from distance for the hosts but also made surprisingly little effort to dive in and make contact with an enticing Riyad Mahrez cross. Leicester then began the second-half brightly and Esteban Cambiasso had a shot blocked after a Matty James cut-back before McGregor was finally called into action, forced to tip a mis-hit Jamie Vardy's cross over the bar. Hull defenders Dawson and Alex Bruce then both picked up seemingly harsh bookings and the way players from both sides surrounded referee Jon Moss will raise eyebrows in a week when Chelsea players were condemned for such behaviour. The Hull players were again unhappy with Moss in the 72nd minute when Huddlestone, who had been booked in the first half, picked up a second yellow card for illegally halting an enterprising Vardy run. Hull City manager Steve Bruce vented his anger over the yellow cards brandished Hull City manager Steve Bruce vented his anger over the yellow cards brandished Leicester’s raucous fans scented a chance for victory but the hosts were cruelly denied from the free-kick following the red card. The set-piece was cleverly tapped to Jeffrey Schlupp and he unleashed a low shot from just inside the area which looked destined for the bottom corner, only to hit his team mate – sub Leonardo Ulloa – and bounce to safety. That piece of misfortune summed up the day for the Foxes but they continued to press and Vardy volleyed over, before embarking on another surging run down the left and cutting the ball back to David Nugent, who shot just wide at the near post. Hull would probably have settled for a draw at this point but suddenly had a chance to claim all three when N’Doye put Hernandez in on goal with a clever quick free-kick. However, the substitute did not get much power on his shot and Schwarzer pulled off a fine save low to his right. Leicester kept pouring forward manfully at the other end but Mahrez put a long-range free-kick straight at McGregor and the hosts now need a remarkable run of results if they are to beat the drop. Soccer Saturday verdict - Paul Merson Paul Merson gives his thoughts on Leicester and Hull's goalless draw Paul Merson gives his thoughts on Leicester and Hull's goalless draw \"If you look over the whole game, Leicester never really looked like scoring. It was not like they peppered the goal. They have been unlucky this season in certain games but not today. \"I thought the referee did well until the second half, when he booked Dawson – never a foul. He booked Bruce – never a foul. He then got sucked in by Vardy with Huddlestone. It was not a sending off for me, Vardy just ran across the lad and dived. \"Hull were the better team in possession. Leicester played with a lot of enthusiasm and you can't knock their work rate but, when they get in the final third, there is no guile about them.

they were thrashed 4-0 at home by fellow strugglers Aston Villa, conceding all four goals in the first half. Christian Benteke and Gabriel Agbonlahor scored twice each as Sunderland completely capitulated before half-time, causing angry scenes among the home supporters at the Stadium of Light. Benteke turned in the opener on 16 minutes before Agbonlahor beat Costel Pantillmon inside his near post two minutes later, and then Sunderland supporters began streaming for the exits when Agbonlahor bagged their third after 37 minutes. A number of home fans appeared to throw objects towards manager Gus Poyet and his staff in the home dugout and there was a further exodus when Benteke headed Villa’s fourth in first-half stoppage time. Villa manager Tim Sherwood’s side came into the game a point behind Poyet’s but, bouyed by an injection of confidence from back-to-back league and cup wins over West Brom, they moved three points clear of danger with a third straight win. Poyet's side, however, are just two points above third-bottom Burnley and this was the first time they have conceded four goals at home this season. Christian Benteke: celebrates scoring the opening goal against Sunderland Sunderland manager Gus Poyet accepted responsibility for their dismal 4-0 defeat Sunderland manager Gus Poyet accepted responsibility for their dismal 4-0 defeat Fabian Delph, who controlled midfield for Villa, threatened with an early shot sent wide of the far post before Benteke turned in a Scott Sinclair cross in acres of space to make it 1-0. Agbonlahor then capitalised on a mistake by John O’Shea that saw the defender misjudge a chipped ball forward and allow the Villa winger to beat Pantillimon inside his near post. Several Sunderland players had frank discussions with Poyet on the touchline in the hope of restoring stability, but they failed to break Villa down and were shambolic in their attempts to quell counter-attacks. Charles N’Zogbia broke through midfield and found Agbonlahor sprinting inside from the right, who turned inside his marker and fired into the bottom corner for 3-0. Amid angry scenes, Sunderland fans began leaving the ground in their droves and a handful appeared to make for the home dugout, where a scarf and a season ticket appeared to be thrown towards Sunderland staff. Sunderland players: looked shell-shocked after the fourth Aston Villa manager Tim Sherwood was thrilled with his side's 4-0 victory Aston Villa manager Tim Sherwood was thrilled with his side's 4-0 victory Benteke added the fourth when he timed his jump to perfection and headed in to cap off another superb breakway on the stroke of half-time. Sunderland's disarray was further evident when they played the first three minutes of the second half with 10 men due to Seb Larsson receiving treatment in the dressing room for a knock. After he emerged to ironic cheers from what was left of the home suppport, Sunderland played a more stable second half and substitute Connor Wickham hit the post late on. But such was the away side's control, Sherwood also able to hand 16-year-old striker Rushian Hepburn-Murphy his Aston Villa debut as a late substitute. Tim Sherwood: a great day for Villa boss, but it's misery for Gus Poyet Having watched the game, Sky Sports' Charlie Nicholas told Soccer Saturday: “Today was shambolic and this team is on its knees.

However, Pulis’ side were far superior, especially in the first half, as they pressed forward from the off and comfortably repelled Stoke on their rare forays forward. Saido Berahino twice tested Stoke goalkeeper Asmir Begovic in the first quarter of an hour from the edge of the box, with a wayward drive from Victor Moses the best the visitors could conjure up. It was little surprise then when the Baggies took the lead. Craig Gardner had time to get his head up and pick out Ideye with his cross from the right. The Nigerian shrugged off the challenge of Phil Bardsley and stooped to head low into Begovic's right-hand corner. The striker felt he should have had a second soon after as Begovic failed to collect a simple through-ball. Ideye capitalised on the goalkeeper's error to prod the ball home from close range, but he was correctly adjudged to be offside. Stoke manager Mark Hughes said his side didn't deserve a win against West Brom Stoke manager Mark Hughes said his side didn't deserve a win against West Brom Albion had another chance to double their lead shortly before the Bosnian’s slip-up, as Craig Dawson played a wonderful through-ball down the right to Berahino, who burst into the box and fired narrowly wide of the far post. It was a tight angle and the youngster’s decision to shoot did not go down well with a couple of his team-mates, who were expecting a cut back. Likely with the words of Hughes still ringing in their ears, Stoke started far quicker in the second period and a high ball into the box left Ben Foster wanting. The Albion goalkeeper was beaten the ball by Peter Crouch, before Walters fired over. That proved to be Foster's last action and, having received treatment for an injury, the England man was replaced by Boaz Myhill. Shortly afterwards, Stoke engineered their best effort of the game. Marc Wilson crossed from the left and Walters' flicked header looped goalwards and required Myhill to tip it over the crossbar. Ideye celebrates with Craig Gardner West Brom responded with a spell of pressure of their own and Dawson had a decent shout for a penalty turned down by referee Michael Oliver after turning Geoff Cameron in the box. Cameron got nothing of the ball, but the fact that Dawson was highly unlikely to reach the ball before it went out of play surely worked in his favour. A Crouch header straight at Myhill was the best Stoke could muster until stoppage time, when the former England striker got on to a bouncing ball over the top. Myhill rushed from his goal and brought down Crouch just outside the box. With the striker moving away from goal and a number of defenders covering Myhill escaped with just a yellow card. He will no doubt consider his decision justified, especially after seeing Marko Arnautovic put the resulting free-kick straight into the wall. The win should put an end to any lingering relegation worries Baggies' fans may have had, while Stoke remain in the top half of table. Soccer Saturday verdict – Phil Thompson Phil Thompson discusses West Brom's 1-0 win over Stoke. Phil Thompson discusses West Brom's 1-0 win over Stoke. “I think West Brom deserved the victory. They had more opportunities, they worked the goalkeeper a little bit more. They even lost their goalkeeper, Ben Foster had to come off and Myhill came on. All in all I think it was a good day’s work. Typical Tony Pulis – clean sheet, winning 1-0 and making sure the opposition don’t have too many chances. “It was a great goal really. The ball got crossed in from the right-hand side and as the ball has come in, Brown Ideye has kept his eye on the ball and watched it coming over but it’s dreadful from Phil Bardsley the right-back. He thinks the ball is going over him but Ideye keeps his eye on the ball, stoops low down and puts it in the bottom corner.” Player ratings West Brom: Foster (4); Dawson (7), McAuley (7), Lescott (8), Brunt (6); Gardner (6), Morrison (6), Fletcher (8), Sessegnon (7); Berahino (7), Ideye (6).

Burnley duo George Boyd and Ben Mee believe their win over Manchester City could be a vital Burnley duo George Boyd and Ben Mee believe their win over Manchester City could be a vital The Clarets were fully deserving of victory and secured the points on the hour mark when George Boyd drilled in a fantastic first-time shot from the edge of the box. David Silva and Sergio Aguero wasted good chances for City, who were also denied an injury-time penalty when Pablo Zabaleta appeared to be caught by a sliding challenge from Ben Mee. Both the result and the disappointing performance are far from ideal preparation for Manuel Pellegrini’s side ahead of their Champions League trip to Barcelona in midweek. City again looked unconvincing against the hard-working Clarets and gave the ball away cheaply on too many occasions.

They pressed the visitors all over the pitch and restricted them to few clear opportunities on goal. The best chance of the first half fell to Edin Dzeko but he couldn’t beat Tom Heaton after being played in by Fernandinho. Joe Hart was called into action at the other end to claim a deflected Scott Arfield shot before Aguero smashed an effort into the side-netting. Sean Dyche was proud of his player's effort after they beat Manchester City 1-0 Sean Dyche was proud of his player's effort after they beat Manchester City 1-0 The second half proved a much livelier affair with both sides showing greater urgency. Aguero stretched the Burnley defence with a nice turn and run from halfway but Silva’s touch let him down when he was played through on goal by the Argentine. Aguero then stabbed an effort just wide himself when he met a Zabaleta ball from the right with a quick snap-shot. Burnley upped their tempo in response and Boyd served warning of his prowess with a volleyed effort from 20 yards which flew just wide. Man City had a penalty appeal turned down, but did they deserve any luck? Man City had a penalty appeal turned down, but did they deserve any luck? He went one better to give the Clarets the lead just after the hour, hitting a brilliant half-volley from the edge of the box after a free-kick was headed out to him. Pellegrini immediately tried to shake things up by sending on Wilfried Bony for Dzeko and then throwing on Stevan Jovetic. But City could not penetrate the Clarets defence as Aguero headed a great chance wide from Yaya Toure’s cross. The visitors were then denied a penalty in injury-time when Mee appeared to catch Zabaleta in the box with a sliding tackle.

Kane, who was nurtured by QPR's head coach when in the Tottenham youth team, found the net either side of half-time - his 25th and 26th goals of the season - in a pulsating affair that saw Christian Eriksen and Charlie Austin hit the woodwork, as well as QPR have two strong penalty appeals turned down. Sandro scored late on against his former club but it was not enough as the west Londoners lost by a one-goal margin for the 11th time this season and remain three points adrift of safety. Tottenham, meanwhile, move above Southampton into sixth after victory, three points off Manchester United in fourth. Harry Kane: Happy with how Spurs have bounced back following their Europa League exit Harry Kane: Happy with how Spurs have bounced back following their Europa League exit Kane sent a warning out to the QPR defence inside five minutes when he latched onto a Kyle Walker cross but his header was brilliantly saved by Rob Green. Roy Hodgson was in the stands to check out the progress of a man he now deems ready for a call-up but it was another English striker, Austin, who caught the eye midway through the half. QPR’s 15-goal man was denied by close range from Hugo Lloris on 19 minutes after a poor Walker back-header was seized upon by the striker. He had an even better chance nine minutes later but rattled the crossbar from 15 yards. Mauricio Pochettino: Pleased with his side's performance Mauricio Pochettino: Pleased with his side's performance That miss would prove costly as on 33 minutes as Kane showed Austin how it should be done, heading home an Andros Townsend free-kick amid confusion between Green and his QPR defence. Undeterred by the goal QPR continued to create good opportunities and they were left stunned on 38 minutes as Mauricio Isla was caught in the area by a reckless Lloris, who came flying out of his goal, but referee Craig Pawson was unmoved. Eriksen had a quiet opening 45 minutes but burst onto the scene early in the second with a ferocious 25-yard drive that came cannoning back off the post. Townsend then went close from 20 yards after a mistake by Steven Caulker before Bobby Zamora tested Lloris with a half volley from a tight angle. Chris Ramsey: Frustrated decisions went against his side Chris Ramsey: Frustrated decisions went against his side Austin then had to become a goal-saver rather than goalscorer, clearing a Eriksen shot off the line. The end-to-end nature of the game always threatened more goals and it was Kane who seized the opportunity on 66 minutes. Rio Ferdinand tried to play Kane offside near the halfway line but got his bearings wrong as the young striker got on his shoulder and burst through on goal from a Ryan Mason pass. There was an air of inevitability as he went one-on-one with Green, coolly rounding the goalkeeper and tapping the ball into the empty net. QPR responded in the same manner as they did in midweek against Arsenal to going 2-0 down by hitting back within five minutes. Sandro, who made 81 appearances for Tottenham, found space on the edge of the area and planed a lovely drive into the bottom corner. The goal lifted the crowd at Loftus Road and they were left seething just three minutes later when Nabil Bentaleb blocked a goal bound Austin drive from 10 yards with his hands as he lifted them to cover his face. However, once again referee Pawson rejected QPR’s strong appeals for a spot kick and Spurs hung on to continue their pursuit of Champions League football.

But after a damaging loss to Liverpool last time out, a morale-boosting win at least ensures the gap to Chelsea stays at five points. Had City’s £28m striker Wilfried Bony - making his first start for his new club on a night when skipper Vincent Kompany was dropped to the subs' bench - had his shooting boots on in the opening 45 minutes then the game could have been over as a contest before the interval. Manuel Pellegrini: Important to pick up a win after a disappointing week Manuel Pellegrini: Important to pick up a win after a disappointing week The muscular Ivorian first saw an early header cleared off the line by Esteban Cambiasso, before then being denied by a smart block at the near post by veteran goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer. But Bony’s best opening came three minutes before half-time when, after being picked out by a delicious Silva through-ball over the Leicester back four, the forward blazed wastefully over the bar from six yards out. In between those half-chances City winger Jesus Navas also tested the reflexes of the visitors’ 42-year-old shot-stopper, with Schwarzer doing brilliantly to divert the Spaniard’s 20-yards curler past the post. Leicester, though, were not without their own moments of threat, particularly in a period midway through the opening 45 minutes when first Riyad Mahrez appeared to be bundled over in the box by Bony, but referee Robert Madley deemed it an accidental collision. A minute later, club-record signing Andrej Kramaric was played clean through on goal by Mahrez’s fine pass, only for Hart to keep the scoreline goalless by dispossessing the Croatia international as he attempted to round the ‘keeper. Nigel Pearson’s men were made to pay for that miss two minutes into injury-time at the end of the first period when Aleksandar Kolarov’s left-wing centre fell kindly at the feet of Silva, with the little Spaniard making no mistake from six yards out at the second time of asking. Nigel Pearson: Leicester must remain positive in their remaining games Nigel Pearson: Leicester must remain positive in their remaining games But if that strike was meant to settle City nerves, it failed to do so, and it was Leicester who came closest to scoring next when Kramaric’s free-kick from the left-hand corner of the area was deflected inches past Hart’s near post. The visitors were unlucky not to have been awarded a spot-kick in the build-up to the award of that set-play but the man in the middle adjudged Fernando’s foul on Kramaric to have taken place just outside the area when subsequent TV replays suggested otherwise. When Mahrez hit the outside of Hart’s post with 17 minutes remaining, Leicester must have known their luck was out for the night and their resistance was finally killed off late on. Navas, who impressed throughout down City’s right flank, put in a wicked centre which Milner, who had replaced Bony, tapped home to wrap up the points.

Manchester United gained a vital 1-0 victory against Newcastle thanks to Ashley Young's late strike, but the match was overshadowed by allegations of spitting against Jonny Evans and Papiss Cisse. Tim Krul's inspired form kept the visitors at bay until the 89th minute but it was the Dutchman’s error that handed three points to the visitors when he passed the ball straight to Young to tap into an empty net. Louis van Gaal's side stay fourth after extending a run that has seen them lose just twice in 22 games in all competitions but defender Evans, as well as Newcastle striker Cisse could face FA action for their involvement in a first-half altercation. Evans and Cisse spit storm After the duo were caught in a tangle for the ball, Evans appeared to spit in Cisse's direction, before the striker seemed to respond in similar fashion. Referee Anthony Taylor didn't see the incident and also denied a strong penalty claim for Newcastle when Chris Smalling tripped Emmanuel Riviere in the box just 10 minutes in. Newcastle were given a lift after the break when Jonas Gutierrez came on to make his first appearance since recovering from testicular cancer. Louis van Gaal and John Carver refused to comment on the Evans- Cisse spitting incident Louis van Gaal and John Carver refused to comment on the Evans- Cisse spitting incident The midfielder was booked two minutes after his introduction for a foul on Adnan Januzaj, who had replaced Angel Di Maria shortly before the hour-mark on another difficult night for the Argentine. United created the better chances as they looked to strengthen their grip on fourth place but struggled to find a way past Krul. The keeper made a brilliant double save to deny Marouane Fellaini and Young in the second half before stopping a powerful header from the tireless Wayne Rooney. Newcastle's best chance of the match came when Cisse dragged his effort wide after being played in by substitute Ayoze Perez. Cisse had another opportunity to level the score at the death, but it was Young's strike that proved decisive as United maintained their push for a top-four finish with only their fourth league win on the road this term. Dwight Yorke's verdict Manchester United had a few chances but they had a few scares as well. It was a stonewall penalty for Emmanuel Riviere in the first 10 minutes - a real clumsy challenge by Chris Smalling. But time and time again United, somehow, do it. It wasn't vintage and Angel di Maria struggled again but Wayne Rooney was outstanding in terms of his hold-up play, determination and leadership.

Alexis Sanchez scored his first goal for seven games as Arsenal beat QPR 2-1 to maintain their imperious Premier League form. QPR had looked comfortable in the first-half but Olivier Giroud opened the scoring on 64 minutes and Sanchez doubled the lead five minutes later as Arsenal, who remain in third, extended their winning run to four league games. Charlie Austin grabbed the goal his performance deserved late on but it was just a consolation. With Aston Villa winning on Tuesday, QPR are now three points from safety, albeit with a game in hand. Francis Coquelin: Arsenal's 2-1 win over QPR was massive Francis Coquelin: Arsenal's 2-1 win over QPR was massive Early signs suggested that this would be an uncomfortable evening for the visitors with QPR intent on targeting Arsenal’s new signing Gabriel with the muscle of Bobby Zamora. The defender struggled to deal with Zamora’s physical play and was replaced by Laurent Koscielny midway through the half after taking more than few knocks from the QPR frontman. The hosts failed to profit from Zamora’s dominant play in the final third, though, with Matt Phillips coming closest with a cross-shot that was palmed away by David Ospina. Arsene Wenger: Arsenal played with a lot of desire and belief Arsene Wenger: Arsenal played with a lot of desire and belief Austin also went close with a rasping 25-yard drive that skimmed the post. Arsenal struggled to get their midfield creators into the game in the first 45 minutes but came out with fresh impetus after the break. Mesut Ozil’s appeals for a penalty on 47 minutes were rejected when he appeared to be tugged back in the six-yard box by Karl Henry while trying to latch onto a Tomas Rosicky cut-back. Olivier Giroud celebrates opening the scoring - his fifth in five games. But Arsenal continued to press and got the goal their pressure deserved through Giroud, who has now scored five goals in his last five games. Young QPR full-back Darnell Furlong was left exposed on the right and Sanchez ran at him with intent before shifting the ball to Kieran Gibbs, whose shot was blocked by Clint Hill but followed up from three yards by the Frenchman. Furlong was struggling to cope with Sanchez’s direct running and the Chilean got his goal – his first since the 3-0 victory over Stoke in January – on 69 minutes. Francis Coquelin, wearing a protective mask, tracks Charlie Austin. He should have scored two minutes earlier but though he fluffed his lines when through on goal after a Steven Caulker error, he was foot perfect when driving to the by-line, cutting back onto his right foot and beating Rob Green at his near post with a low drive. That five-minute blitz knocked the stuffing out of QPR and Ozil nearly made it 3-0 on 76 minutes, firing a deflected shot onto the post via the outstretched hand of Green. Chris Ramsey: QPR's defeat was extremely frustrating considering how well they played in the first half Chris Ramsey: QPR's defeat was extremely frustrating considering how well they played in the first half Austin gave his team hope with eight minutes to play, finding space inside the area between Per Mertesacker and Gibbs before smashing a fine effort into the top corner.

"Moses rose highest to open the scoring at the Britannia. Stoke City claimed their first league double over Everton since 1967 with a 2-0 win at the Britannia Stadium. Victor Moses’ stunning header on the half-hour mark edged the game in favour of the dominant Potters, before substitute Mame Biram Diouf settled things six minutes from time. Stoke recorded three consecutive league wins for the first time this season but Everton's miserable run in the Premier League continues, Roberto Martinez's side thriving in the Europa League but with only one domestic win in 12. After a frenetic start to proceedings, which saw both sides fashion early chances, Stoke took control of the game and were in front when Moses rose highest to head home Phil Bardsley's driven cross. The Potters were unfortunate not to have doubled their lead before the break as Bardsley continued to cause havoc down the right wing. Pressure beginning to mount on Roberto Martinez Having weathered a brief Everton revival in the second half, inspired by the addition of substitutes Leon Osman and Arouna Kone, Diouf rounded off a fine Stoke counter to tap home Marko Arnautovic’s shot which had struck the post to guarantee the points. Battles across the pitch begin to develop from the first whistle as Gareth Barry and Charlie Adam, and Steven Naismith and Phil Bardsley, came to blows in the opening exchanges. One of Mark Hughes’ two changes before the game saw the injured Stephen Ireland make way for Adam and, after a keenly-contested opening quarter of an hour, the Stoke boss was forced into another change as Philipp Wollscheid had to be replaced by Geoff Cameron. With chances few and far between for large parts of the first half, Stoke were rewarded for their persistent approach down the right wing on the half-hour mark. Adam and Bardsley combined well to isolate Naismith, before the right-back drilled a cross towards Moses. The Nigerian just created a yard of space in the penalty area and directed an inch-perfect header into the far right-hand corner. Diouf celebrates Stoke's second with team-mates The second half followed a similar pattern to the first as both sides made promising starts with early chances. For the first time in the game, Romelu Lukaku was able to get away from his marker and get a shot away, but substitute Cameron was able to get back and deflect his effort out for a corner. With an hour on the clock Martinez played his hand, as Kone and Osman replaced Barry and Lennon for the Toffees. And the pair almost had the desired effect as first Osman and then Kone saw efforts blocked and saved. Roberto Martinez believes his Everton team lacked quality in the final third Roberto Martinez believes his Everton team lacked quality in the final third Peter Crouch’s quest for the most Premier League headed goals record will have to wait another week as Diouf came off the bench in his place. Stoke looked to hit Everton on the break and it was this tactic which led to their second goal inside the final ten minutes. Mark Hughes says anyone at Stoke’s 2-0 victory over Everton would have seen the character and determination his team have. Mark Hughes says anyone at Stoke’s 2-0 victory over Everton would have seen the character and determination his team have. After fellow substitute Arnautovic had raced away from the tiring Everton defence and rattled the woodwork, Diouf was on hand to notch his eighth goal of season as the Potters continued their fine record of remaining unbeaten in the last 20 games in which they have taken the lead. Luke Garbutt went close with a free kick in the dying minutes, but Asmir Begovic was equal to the challenge. Victory moves the Potters up to eighth in the table, while the Toffees remain 14th, 14 points behind Stoke on 28 points - six points clear of the relegation places.

"report": "Tottenham Hotspur 3-2 Swansea: Bafetimbi Gomis in collapse scare as Swansea lose out to Tottenham Ryan Mason scores for Tottenham Tottenham got their top-four tilt back on track by overcoming Swansea 3-2 on a night when Bafetimbi Gomis' collapse had those inside White Hart Lane fearing the worst. Gomis, who has a history of fainting, fell to the ground in the centre circle after Nacer Chadli had given Spurs a seventh-minute lead. Spurs players had their hands on their heads as the 29-year-old was tended to by medical staff and the incident brought back memories of Fabrice Muamba’s cardiac arrest at the same ground in 2012. Mauricio Pochettino: Win extremely satisfying following Capital One Cup final defeat Mauricio Pochettino: Win extremely satisfying following Capital One Cup final defeat But the striker regained consciousness in time to acknowledge the crowd as he was stretchered off and Swansea confirmed afterwards their forward was \"fine\". Ki Sung-yueng equalised after the game restarted but Spurs were dominant in the second half and opened up a 3-1 lead thanks to goals from Ryan Mason and Andros Townsend. Gylfi Sigurdsson reduced the deficit with a late volley but Mauricio Pochettino's side held on to secure their first victory in almost a month thanks to a spectacular save in injury-time from Hugo Lloris. Garry Monk: Swansea made mistakes that led to two of Tottenham's goals Garry Monk: Swansea made mistakes that led to two of Tottenham's goals The win is a welcome relief for Spurs after the recent disappointments of exiting the Europa League and losing the Capital One Cup final to Chelsea. Pochettino stuck with the same starting line-up that were beaten at Wembley and they soon took the lead as Danny Rose whipped in a cross for Chadli to volley home. But the goal was soon forgotten as Gomis collapsed, receiving medical attention for four minutes, before being taken off on a stretcher and with an oxygen mask. Bafetimbi Gomis is stretchered off at White Hart Lane When play resumed, Swansea were soon level, Sigurdsson hitting the woodwork with a brilliant free-kick and Ki alert to finish from a tight angle when the ball was played back into the box. There were few chances in the remainder of an evenly-contested half but Spurs took control after the break. Moments after Harry Kane went close with a header, Mason fired past Lukasz Fabianski for his first Premier League goal after Christian Eriksen’s mazy run cut through the Swansea defence. Townsend put the hosts firmly in charge nine minutes later after a good advantage from referee Michael Oliver, who allowed play to continue following a foul on Nabil Bentaleb just outside the Spurs box. Spurs countered at pace and Townsend raced down the left wing, cut inside a defender and fired into the far corner. The home side looked in the mood for more and Kyle Walker’s deflected shot went narrowly wide of the post while substitute Roberto Soldado twice went close to adding a fourth. But Spurs - who paid tribute to the late Dave Mackay with a minute's applause before kick-off - could not put the game to bed and Swansea set up a tense finish when Sigurdsson volleyed home from Jefferson Montero’s cross in the 89th minute. Swansea pushed for a late equaliser and only Lloris' late heroics prevented the points being shared.

The Blues overcame a stern test of their title credentials thanks to Eden Hazard’s first-half header and a string of fine saves from goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois. West Ham pressed forward all night but could not find the breakthrough as Jose Mourinho's men defended resolutely, needing crucial interventions from the imperious Courtois and then Gary Cahill to take all three points back across London. Sam Allardyce says West Ham played exceptionally well and deserved something out of the game despite losing 1-0 to Chelsea Sam Allardyce says West Ham played exceptionally well and deserved something out of the game despite losing 1-0 to Chelsea Mourinho, who has never tasted defeat at West Ham, made just two changes to his Capital One Cup-winning side for the trip to Upton Park with Courtois and Oscar restored to the starting line-up but it was West Ham, who lost Winston Reid to injury in the eighth minute, who looked the more likely to break the deadlock in the opening stages. Jose Mourinho: Win at West Ham was especially satisfying Jose Mourinho: Win at West Ham was especially satisfying Kevin Nolan was brought in to replace Alex Song for the hosts and he was instrumental in creating West Ham’s first chance in the 18th minute, but Cheikhou Kouyate’s shot was smartly saved by the onrushing Courtois. West Ham were causing John Terry - booked for pulling back Enner Valencia - and Cahill plenty of problems but could not take advantage as Diafra Sakho miskicked Kouyate’s pass when shooting from inside the penalty area. For all their good work, a West Ham lapse in concentration was punished as Hazard ghosted in unmarked behind the Hammers defence to head Ramires’ cross past Adrian from five yards out in the 22nd minute. Eden Hazard celebrates the winner at Upton Park The goal drew the sting out of the home side and they were caught out again as Hazard released Diego Costa on goal, only for Carl Jenkinson to make an excellent last-gasp tackle. Minutes later, Jenkinson was in the thick of the action again but this time at the other end. The on-loan full-back whipped in an excellent cross from the right to find Sakho, but the striker headed the ball straight at a thankful Courtois. West Ham continued to test the Chelsea back four after the break but when they managed to beat Terry and his troops, they could not get past Courtois, who got his fingertips to Sakho’s close range shot. The visitors thought they had wrapped up all three points as Ramires cut back on his left foot in the penalty area, but his shot rebounded off the post and into the grateful arms of Adrian. Enner Valencia is put under pressure by Kurt Zouma The Brazilian had another chance to extend the Blues’ advantage minutes later but this time it was Adrian with the heroics as he saved the header with his legs. However, in a pulsating game in east London, it was West Ham who were piling on the pressure late on as Downing breezed past Branislav Ivanovic to pick out Sakho, who failed to direct his free header on target. Chelsea were dropping deep in attempt to soak up the pressure but it nearly back-fired when Courtois made his only error of night, spilling the ball to Sakho, before Cahill intervened. Substitute Willian had one final chance to wrap things up for the league leaders in the dying stages but Aaron Cresswell managed to clear off the line, while at the other end Nene's shot was well blocked by Terry to typify Chelsea's defending on the night. Sam Allardyce and Jose Mourinho on the touchline at Upton Park The Hammers now have one win in 11 league games and have slipped to 10th in the standings but for Chelsea, it is a crucial win to stay five points clear of Manchester City with a game in hand. Mourinho can now focus on next week's Champions League last-16 second leg with Paris St Germain safe in the knowledge his side are in an excellent position to add a first league title in five years to Sunday’s Capital One Cup success.

Liverpool maintained their push for a top-four place with a 2-0 win over Burnley at Anfield. Stand-in captain Jordan Henderson gave Liverpool the lead in the first half with his second goal in as many games, driving home a superb strike from the edge of the area, and then turned provider for Daniel Sturridge in the second half. Brendan Rodgers: Liverpool were defensively very strong Brendan Rodgers: Liverpool were defensively very strong The win - which extends an unbeaten run in the Premier League to 12 games - keeps the Reds two points off the Champions League spots after fourth-placed Manchester United left it late to beat Newcastle. Sturridge replaced Lazar Markovic for just his second league start since returning from injury, and it was the 25-year-old who had the game’s first chance. Daniel Sturridge headed home the second goal after half-time After playing a nice one-two with both Adam Lallana and Raheem Sterling on the right, the England international's left-footed shot was superbly tipped wide by Tom Heaton. It was then Henderson’s turn to force Heaton into a save, seeing his 20-yard drive kept out well by the Burnley stopper low to his left. But Henderson - wearing the armband with Steven Gerrard recovering from injury - got his goal on 29 minutes, firing home an unstoppable 25-yard shot into the corner after Philippe Coutinho’s effort from just inside the area had been blocked by Jason Shackell. Sean Dyche: Burnley cannot afford to give away soft goals Sean Dyche: Burnley cannot afford to give away soft goals Coutinho went close to doubling Liverpool’s lead moments later, but his curling effort from 25 yards was just a yard wide of the goal. Heaton made another key save just before half-time, blocking Sturridge’s low effort after he was put through on goal by Coutinho. Ashley Barnes tries to get away from Joe Allen After the break, the ball fell to Henderson 35 yards out on the right, and the in-form Liverpool skipper found Sturridge superbly at the far post, allowing the striker to head past Heaton from close range. Danny Ings had Burnley’s best chance of the game, doing well on the byline to dummy past Henderson, but his stretched effort was blocked.

Saido Berahino had struck his 18th goal of the season midway through the second half to cancel out Gabriel Agbonlahor's 22nd-minute opener and put the visitors on course for a point. But Villa claimed their first Premier League victory since 7 December - 12 matches ago - when Benteke kept his nerve and coolly side-footed home a spot-kick in second-half injury-time. Sherwood had said in the build-up to the game that Villa would need to win six of their remaining 11 league fixtures to have any chance of avoiding relegation and after a slow start to proceedings where home nerves were evident, his team took control of the contest. West Brom Head Coach Tony Pulis says his team didn't make the most of their chances as they were beaten by Aston Villa in the Premier League. West Brom Head Coach Tony Pulis says his team didn't make the most of their chances as they were beaten by Aston Villa in the Premier League. Agbonlahor thought he had given Villa a 14th-minute lead, but after producing a clever turn in the area and getting a shot away which Ben Foster somehow allowed to squirm under his body, the goalkeeper just managed to react in time to recover the situation before the whole of the ball had crossed the goal-line. That near miss was soon forgotten when eight minutes later Agbonlahor did open the scoring after some route-one football, not that the Villa faithful cared about how the goal came about. Villa 'keeper Brad Guzan launched a back-pass high upfield before Benteke flicked the ball into the path of the onrushing Agbonlahor, who just beat the offside trap before keeping his nerve to shoot low past Foster at his near post. Tim Sherwood recorded his first win as Aston Villa manager as Christian Benteke’s last-minute penalty helped beat West Bromwich Albion 2-1 Tim Sherwood recorded his first win as Aston Villa manager as Christian Benteke’s last-minute penalty helped beat West Bromwich Albion 2-1 That strike gave the Villa players a huge lift in confidence and they were unlucky not to double their advantage. After another long clearance upfield Agbonlahor found himself one-on-one with Foster, only for Joleon Lescott to just get back in time to clear the frontman’s shot off the line for the second time in the opening period. Then, in first-half injury time, Fabian Delph twisted and turned on the left-hand edge of the West Brom box, only to see his curling effort beat Foster’s outstretched hand, but not the post. But Villa’s exertions in the opening 45 minutes soon began to catch up with them and, as Sherwood may have feared as those first-half chances went begging, West Brom found themselves on level terms with their first effort on target after 66 minutes. The visitors played a left-wing corner high to the back post where Lescott lost Agbonlahor and his flick back across goal was headed in by the ever-alert Berahino for his 12th league goal of the campaign. A tense Villa Park almost boiled over when Berahino and Alan Hutton squared up, the latter catching the frontman with a high boot that might well have earned him a red rather than yellow card. Villa, though, were not to be denied as Sherwood urged his players forward in search of a winner, which came their way when Foster initially fumbled the ball and then, when trying to make up for his mistake, brought down Matthew Lowton. Benteke, who had not scored since netting against Manchester United on 20 December, took the spot-kick responsibilities with aplomb to easily beat Foster and move Villa out of the drop zone in the process. Charlie Nicholas's verdict: Villa were much better in the first half, they scored a fine goal, then when it went 1-1 you thought they were going to cave in. But Foster gave them a lifeline and Benteke, what coolness, he has been so out of form but he was covered in ice he was so cool.

"report": "Steve Bruce and Gus Poyet clash Steve Bruce and Gus Poyet were involved in a touchline spat as relegation rivals Hull and Sunderland had to settle for a 1-1 draw in a feisty encounter at the KC Stadium. Dame N’Doye’s 15th-minute opener handed the Tigers the advantage for the majority of the game on Humberside, but Jack Rodwell swooped with just a quarter of an hour remaining to snatch a valuable point for the Wearsiders. The game erupted ten minutes before half time when managers Bruce and Poyet had an altercation on the touchline in the wake of Rodwell being booked for simulation. Poyet was sent to the stands by referee Mike Dean for the remainder of the game, but the Uruguayan had an impact from a higher vantage point as his substitutions altered the course of game. Patrick van Aanholt set up Rodwell for the leveller, and though the pair almost combined for a winner in the closing stages, each side in the end looked content to avoid defeat. Sunderland manager Gus Poyet was sent to the stands as his team came from behind to earn a draw at Hull. Sunderland manager Gus Poyet was sent to the stands as his team came from behind to earn a draw at Hull. Sunderland started with Wes Brown and John O’Shea at the heart of defence after the pair avoided suspension following their infamous red card incident at Old Trafford on Saturday. The Black Cats tried to harass their hosts in the opening exchanges but the Tigers, through their use of bright wing-back Andrew Robertson, snatched the initiative before going in front. Having picked up a yellow card for a challenge on Ahmed Elmohamady, Brown was helpless seconds later as Tom Huddlestone drilled a low free kick into the area for N’Doye to nonchalantly flick the ball past Costel Pantilimon for his third goal in three games. Hull pressed for an immediate second but Rodwell was on hand with a last-ditch block on the line to deny David Meyler’s fiercely struck volley. Having prevented a second Hull goal at one end, Rodwell sparked the game’s flashpoint at the other end as he theatrically went to ground in the area following minimal contact from Alex Bruce. The midfielder was booked for simulation, much to the annoyance of Poyet, who appeared to kick out at a water container on the touchline. Poyet was sent to the stands but first made his way towards Bruce and tried to shake his counterpart's hand. Bruce then appeared to charge towards the Uruguayan and had to be physically restrained by assistant referee Stuart Burt. The incident appeared to affect the remainder of the half as it failed to rekindle the intensity seen beforehand. Sunderland’s front two, Jermain Defoe and Danny Graham, were isolated for the Black Cats before Poyet’s change of tactics midway through the second half swung the game in the visitors' favour. Substitues Connor Wickham and Van Aanholt provided width and support in attack and just minutes after the pair were brought on, Sunderland were level. Van Aanholt fashioned a yard and accelerated past Elmohamady before floating the ball to the unmarked Rodwell to nod in from a yard out. Rodwell appeared to head to the ball onto his arm before it nestle in the goal, but the goal was allowed to stand. The pair combined again in the closing stages for what would have been the winner but Rodwell couldn't keep his volley down as Sunderland recorded their 14th draw from 28 games this season. The result sees both sides remain 15th and 16th respectively, with just one point separating each side. Tony Cottee's verdict Defoe played the ball to Rodwell, Rodwell went down and there weren’t too many appeals. Rodwell got a yellow card for diving. Gus Poyet was incensed and it appears he kicked over the water bucket. At which point, Mike Dean comes over and sends Poyet to the stands. Poyet then goes over to Steve Bruce to shake his hand, Bruce doesn’t go to shake his hands and Poyet then sarcastically applauds Steve Bruce. At which point Brucey totally lost it and the linesman did very well.

in the race for Champions League qualification after Sadio Mane’s late strike gave them a scrappy 1-0 win over Crystal Palace. Goals have been hard to come by for Saints at St Mary’s in recent weeks and their goal drought looked set to extend as Graziano Pelle wasted a glorious chance just before the break. Ronald Koeman’s side rode their luck after the break as Crystal Palace hit the post through Wilfried Zaha but the hosts finally made the breakthrough in the 83rd minute as Mane pounced on Julian Speroni’s error to give his side all three points. Southampton manager Ronald Koeman says victory over Crystal Palace was a crucial win for his side Southampton manager Ronald Koeman says victory over Crystal Palace was a crucial win for his side The strike inflicted Crystal Palace’s first defeat on the road under Alan Pardew and moved Southampton back up into fifth, just one point behind Manchester United in the race for fourth. Saints were seeing plenty of the ball but looked like a side lacking in confidence as first Eljero Elia fired wide, before Filip Djuricic blasted over the bar from just inside the box after Victor Wanyama’s blocked shot fell into his path. Crystal Palace were coping well with the Southampton threat but failed to offer much themselves. However, Fraser Forster nearly gifted the visitors the opening goal of the game, dropping Bolasie’s hopeful cross but the England keeper just recovered in time with Zaha waiting pounce.

The ball fell to the feet of the Italian just five yards out, but he looked like a man who has not scored in 10 Premier League matches, prodding his shot wide. Since taking over at Selhurst Park, Pardew had not tasted defeat away from home and he sent out his side with renewed purpose after the break as Zaha’s cross found Jason Puncheon in the box, but the forward’s shot was straight at Forster. The visitors continued to press forward and went closest to breaking the deadlock as Bolasie’s shot was blocked by Forster but the rebound fell to Zaha, who struck the far post with his shot.

Koeman responded by sending on Dusan Tadic and the move had the desired effect as Southampton grabbed a foothold in the game once again, creating half chances for Djuricic and Pelle. It looked like it was going to be more St Mary’s woe for Southampton when Maya Yoshida failed to get a good connection on Pelle’s flick on with the goal at his mercy. But the gloom around the stadium was lifted when substitute James Ward-Prowse beat his man on the edge of the penalty area to fire a left-footed shot on goal which Speroni could only parry. The ball rebounded into the path of Mane, who made no mistake in firing home to score Southampton’s first home goal in five hours and 87 minutes of football and get Koemen’s side back to winning ways. Sadio Mane scores the winner for Southampton Palace threw on Shola Ameobi in a desperate bid to rescue a point and he fluffed his lines heading Joe Ledley's cross wide. The visitors had one final chance to level but Yoshida was on hand to make a vital block when Bolasie looked poised to pick out a team-mate in the dying stages. But Southampton held on for their 13th Premier League clean sheet and a much needed win to move ahead of Liverpool into fifth, while Palace stay in 12th, eight points above the relegation zone. See all the goals from Tuesday's games on Sky Sports News HQ from midnight. Phil Thompson's verdict Southampton are still struggling to score goals and hit the target. Ward-Prowse showed fantastic ability with a run through the middle, Speroni spilled it and Mane chipped it in, but I think this should have been a draw because Palace did enough to get a point.

Brendan Rodgers' side are top of the Premier League form standings since the turn of the year after taking 20 points from a possible 24 and are up to fifth in the table, above Southampton. Lallana hails 'massive' win Lallana hails 'massive' win After netting a scintillating opening goal last week against Saints, Coutinho was at it again at Anfield on Sunday, curling home a majestic effort from 20 yards with 15 minutes left to play. Jordan Henderson had given Liverpool a first-half lead with an equally brilliant strike on 11 minutes before Edin Dzeko rounded off a fantastic team move to equalise 14 minutes later. Graeme Souness hails Coutinho after his winning strike in 2-1 win over Man City Graeme Souness hails Coutinho after his winning strike in 2-1 win over Man City Despite both sides' European exertions in midweek, the pace of the game was frenetic throughout and Adam Lallana had two goals disallowed for the hosts while Sergio Aguero hit the post for City, who remain five points behind Chelsea in the title race. The Blues now have a game in hand. Both teams made fast starts but it was Liverpool who crafted the better early chances, with Lallana heavily involved. The England international drew a save from Joe Hart with a low toe-poked shot after eight minutes and then had a goal disallowed for offside 60 seconds later after brilliantly controlling Raheem Sterling's pass and finishing from a tight angle. Rodgers praises 'incredible' players Rodgers praises 'incredible' players City did not heed the warning though, because the net was rippling again in the 11th minute - and this time, the goal stood. After Vincent Kompany had lost a 50-50 with Coutinho, the Brazilian fed Henderson, who picked out Joe Hart's top left-hand corner with a superb strike. City responded well and could have levelled two minutes later when Aguero capitalised on a mix-up in the Liverpool defence, but his hooked left-foot shot cannoned back off the post. The chance lifted City and they deservedly equalised with a fine team goal after 25 minutes. David Silva fed Aguero in the right channel, and the Argentina striker brilliantly slipped in Dzeko, who beat Simon Mignolet with a low right-foot shot. Lallana had another goal disallowed on 54 minutes when Martin Skrtel was in an offside position when nodding down a free-kick to Lallana, who finished from close range. Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville, who was on co-commentary duty, described the way City were playing as \"embarrassing\" as they repeatedly were cut open in midfield by a relentless Liverpool attacking unit. Pellegrini defends formation Pellegrini defends formation Coutinho was the spearhead and it was he that conjured up the match-winning moment on 75 minutes. It was an effort very similar to Henderson's as Sterling fed Coutinho on the left corner of the box, and he then cut inside and swept a brilliant right-foot shot into the far corner. City stepped up their intensity after the goal as Liverpool tired slightly and with the clock ticking down, Silva shot agonisingly wide from inside the area after Yaya Toure had bulldozed his way through the Liverpool midfield and defence. But an equaliser would have been harsh on Liverpool, who restricted City to just one shot on target throughout the game - the fewest they have had in any Premier League game this season. Liverpool march on, with Burnley next up at Anfield on Wednesday night, when Manuel Pellegrini's City host Leicester at the Etihad.

Giroud turned in a volley from Mesut Ozil’s corner in the 39th minute of the Emirates Stadium encounter before Rosicky made sure of the points with a late deflected effort. Romelu Lukaku and Aaron Lennon went closest for Everton, who have now won just one of their last 11 league matches, but both were denied by good saves from David Ospina. While the result continues Everton’s poor run of form, it is the ideal response from Arsenal following their disappointing Champions League defeat to Monaco in midweek. Wenger happy with bounce-back win Wenger happy with bounce-back win Per Mertesacker paid the price for that performance as he was replaced by Gabriel Paulista, who made his first Premier League start. The Brazilian grew in confidence as the game progressed but looked nervy at times in the first half and was nearly caught out in the 17th minute when he hesitated on the ball. Lukaku took advantage to nick it away from him, but, fortunately for Gabriel, his keeper was more decisive and did well to clear his lines. It took Arsenal until the half-hour mark to create their first chance as Alexis Sanchez clipped in a cross from the left to Giroud, who got ahead of Phil Jagielka but headed wide. Gabriel then made a superbly-timed sliding tackle to halt Lukaku as he charged into the box. Martinez: We lacked intent Martinez: We lacked intent The deadlock was broken not long afterwards as Ozil whipped in a corner from the right and Giroud swept a volley into the far corner. The goal appeared to give Arsenal a lift and Santi Cazorla forced Tim Howard to tip a shot over the bar as the half drew to a close. But Everton made a positive start to the second half and Gareth Barry sent an acrobatic volley over the bar. Giroud saw a close-range effort blocked by Jagielka at the other end before Cazorla fired over the bar after a clever one-two with Giroud. Ospina then produced a fantastic reflex save to turn over Lukaku's near-post drive and got down well to save Aaron Lennon's low shot from Seamus Coleman's cut back. There was a lengthy stoppage after a clash of heads between Giroud and team-mate Francis Coquelin left the midfielder with blood pouring from his nose. Coquelin eventually had to be taken off late in the game but Arsenal wrapped up the win when Rosicky's shot deflected off Jagielka and flew past Howard.

And despite West Ham forward Enner Valencia pulling a goal back after 76 minutes, it was too little, too late as far as the home team were concerned. However, anything other than a Palace victory would have been harsh on Alan Pardew's side, who registered a club-record third Premier League away win in a row in the process, despite being fortunate not to also have captain Mile Jedinak dismissed late on for an elbow on Diafra Sakho.

victory at Turf Moor to take them to the magical 40-point mark and leave Burnley winless in six. The game was settled in the 64th minute when Heaton failed to keep out Kieran Trippier's attempted clearance after Jack Cork struck the underside of the crossbar from Bafetimbi Gomis' flick. Garry Monk's side held on to celebrate back-to-back victories for just the third time in the Premier League this season, as they built on last week's famous win over Manchester United and maintained their hopes of a top-10 finish. After Swansea hit the 40-point mark with their win over Burnley, Lukasz Fabianski and Jack Cork say the club have loftier ambitions than safety After Swansea hit the 40-point mark with their win over Burnley, Lukasz Fabianski and Jack Cork say the club have loftier ambitions than safety Swansea striker Gomis had missed the best chance of the first half, but Burnley will count themselves aggrieved to get nothing after just about having the better of a gruelling game. Ashley Barnes - showing no ill effects from the reaction to his challenge on Nemanja Matic last week - looked bright up front while George Boyd and Michael Kightly also had chances in an uninspiring first half. For long spells it looked like Gomis would be left to rue his awful first-half miss when he sprang the hosts' offside trap only to put his effort wide of Heaton's goal. Sean Dyche feels that Burnley need to start turning good performances into wins Sean Dyche feels that Burnley need to start turning good performances into wins Moments earlier, Gomis had served up what passed for the visitors' only shot on target in the opening 45 minutes when he drilled a low shot straight at the Burnley keeper. The hosts had a strong penalty claim rejected by referee Jonathan Moss in the 53rd minute.after Federico Fernandez appeared to handle in the box. Kightly rescued a lost cause on the left and cut along the goal-line to hit a shot which Fabianski parried, and the ball appeared to strike the arm of Fernandez before being cleared. As the hosts began to stretch the game, Barnes came close on the hour mark, latching onto a long ball from Trippier and controlling superbly before firing inches wide of Fabianski's left-hand post. Garry Monk was pleased with Swansea's 1-0 win away at Burnley and said that the first goal was always going to be vital Garry Monk was pleased with Swansea's 1-0 win away at Burnley and said that the first goal was always going to be vital But just as Burnley looked more likely to break the deadlock, it was Swansea who grabbed the lead following a mighty goalmouth melee. Gomis flicked on a Jonjo Shelvey cross to Cork, whose initial effort at the far post was brilliantly tipped against the bar by Burnley keeper Heaton. The rebound again found Cork whose second shot across goal struck the unfortunate Trippier and was deflected into his own net by the goalkeeper in the 64th minute. Swans keeper Lukasz Fabianski pulled off two fine late saves to deny first Barnes then substitute Sam Vokes, but despite a generous five minutes of stoppage time the hosts did not come up with another chance. The result handed Monk's side their third win in their last 12 top-flight away games, while the Clarets remain in relegation trouble in 18th. SOCCER SATURDAY ANALYSIS - MATT LE TISSIER Matthew Le Tissier says Burnley did not create enough chances against Swansea and are too reliant on Danny Ings Matthew Le Tissier says Burnley did not create enough chances against Swansea and are too reliant on Danny Ings \"Burnley didn't create too many chances for a home side if I'm being honest. Barnes had a couple of chances which he could have done better with but Fabianski did well to block them. They were quite sharp chances and Barnes didn’t have a lot of space but Fabianski was there. Burnley lacked a little bit of invention but they were the better team for the first 25 minutes, they looked the more dominant side and Swansea took a while to get going but they had the better end to the first half when Gomis had an effort. \"I don’t think Swansea did enough to take three points from this game. Swansea are increasingly hard to beat, they were well organised today, Fabianski had to make those two saves but not much else after that. They looked dangerous on the counter after they went 1-0 up. Ings wasn’t in the game much today, he worked hard but didn't put himself in too many positions and I don't remember him have a chance today which isn't good enough.\" Player ratings Burnley: Heaton (6) Trippier (5) Keane (5) Shackell (6) Mee (5) Boyd (6) Jones (6) Arfield (6) Kightly (6) Barnes (7) Ings (7).

Radamel Falcao produced a fine piece of skill to turn John O’Shea in the box and was hauled down by the Sunderland defender to earn United a second-half spot-kick.

Wayne Rooney says it was important Manchester United bounced back after their defeat to Swansea Wayne Rooney says it was important Manchester United bounced back after their defeat to Swansea Rooney then added his second - and first from open play in 2015 - by heading in from close range with six minutes left when Costel Pantilimon parried Adnan Januzaj's shot. Januzaj had replaced the disappointing Angel di Maria at half-time. Ander Herrera had a late goal correctly ruled out for offside but the result leaves Sunderland three points above the relegation zone and with just one win in their last 10 Premier League matches. United began the game brightly and Rooney - who had gone eight games without a goal before kick-off - wasted a good chance to open the scoring four minutes in when he headed Di Maria's corner wide. However, Sunderland showed early intent too, with Connor Wickham surging forward and drawing a fine save from David de Gea from the edge of the box before Jermain Defoe curled a shot over the bar. Louis van Gaal is delighted for Wayne Rooney after he scored both of United's goals Louis van Gaal is delighted for Wayne Rooney after he scored both of United's goals United dominated possession throughout the opening 45 minutes though, and the impressive Ashley Young sent a powerful volley over the bar before his cross-shot deflected up onto the woodwork off the foot of O'Shea. The impressive Young - who caused Anthony Reveillere problems throughout the match - then cut inside and bent an effort wide from 25 yards before Sebastian Larsson hacked Marcos Rojo's effort off the line five minutes before the break. Di Maria had a first half to forget, wasting numerous opportunities to deliver a good cross into the box, and was replaced by Januzaj at the interval. The young Belgian had an immediate impact, winning two corners at the start of the second half before lashing a volley wide on the hour mark when Reveillere half-cleared Rooney's free-kick.

However, controversy followed when the referee - advised by his assistants - showed a red card to O’Shea's fellow centre-back Brown before Rooney fired the penalty low past Pantilimon's right. Substitutes Januzaj and Marouane Fellaini both tested the Sunderland shot-stopper as tiredness took its toll on the visitors before Rooney nodded in the second from close range to put the result beyond doubt on 84 minutes. There was still time for one more moment of drama, when Herrera's injury-time goal was rightly ruled out for offside, after Fellaini had spurned a golden opportunity to score a one-on-one chance.

I have been a bit harsh on them this season but I thought they did very well. They gave the ball away very cheaply in the first 15 minutes when Defoe had a shot and should have done better; Wickham should have passed to Defoe but chose to shoot. After that they were dominant, United passed the ball quickly, Ashley Young was very good. United got the penalty in the second half, and it was a stonewall penalty. I do not know how the referee got the decision wrong. It was definitely John O’Shea who committed the foul. O’Shea even admitted it was him and not Brown.

But the Holland international very nearly gifted Villa a 71st-minute equaliser when he failed to collect Westwood's corner, sparking a goalmouth melee which ultimately ended with Benteke putting the ball into the net from Westwood’s cross, but from an offside position. Substitute Perez was denied a second goal by the post after Brad Guzan had managed to get only his fingertips to Ameobi's 76th-minute corner, but one proved to be enough to hand Sherwood his second successive defeat as Villa boss.

A second-half header from substitute Peter Crouch secured Stoke City a narrow 1-0 home win over Hull in the Premier League on Saturday. In a poor game where clear-cut chances were few and far between, Crouch's 71st-minute looping header from Charlie Adam's pin-point cross beat Allan McGregor and found the far corner. The striker had only replaced Mame Biram Diouf less than two minutes earlier, with the match-winner equalling Alan Shearer's record of 46 Premier League headed goals. Substitute Peter Crouch proved to be Stoke’s match-winner in the 1-0 victory over Hull Substitute Peter Crouch proved to be Stoke’s match-winner in the 1-0 victory over Hull Victory is Stoke's sixth in 11 league games, while Hull's recent unbeaten run has been halted at three games. Sone Aluko, one of three Hull changes from last week's win against QPR, came closest for the visitors in the first half by dispossessing Philipp Wollscheid on the touchline before dragging his shot across goal from a tight angle. Stoke, unchanged from their late win over Aston Villa, saw Stephen Ireland have an early shot blocked by Alex Bruce and Steven N'Zonzi drag a low effort well wide as the hosts looked to try to impose themselves. Stoke City manager Mark Hughes was astounded that the officials missed a tackle on Stephen Ireland which left the midfielder with stitches Stoke City manager Mark Hughes was astounded that the officials missed a tackle on Stephen Ireland which left the midfielder with stitches Jon Walters flick from Victor Moses' low, driven corner on the half-hour mark needed to be cleared at the far post by Jake Livermore, with the resulting set-piece seeing Phil Bardsley charged down in a goalmouth scramble by a combination of Aluko and Livermore. Play continued as the hosts appealed for a penalty, with Ireland's scuffed volley into the ground bobbling kindly to McGregor. The home crowd became increasingly frustrated as Erik Pieters was cautioned for a challenge on Gaston Ramirez and Moses was booked for catching Tom Huddlestone with a trailing arm as the pair challenged for a header. Adam replaced the injured Ireland at the interval and brought an immediate reaction for the Potters, seeing a low strike from distance go just wide before bending a free-kick inches wide with McGregor at full stretch. Steve Bruce was disappointed with the officials' decision for Peter Crouch's goal Steve Bruce was disappointed with the officials' decision for Peter Crouch's goal Crouch found the net for the fourth match running to give the hosts the lead, before striking wide minutes later after N'Zonzi headed the ball across goal. Hull introduced Dame N'Doye and then Abel Hernandez in pursuit of an equaliser and won a series of corners, but the closest they game to an elusive goal was when Marc Wilson charged down Paul McShane's close-range shot in injury time.

There were only two attempts on target during the whole game and the second one was a goal. Adam came on at half-time and changed the tempo of the game. He got in the pockets of space and within five minutes, he had two really good efforts. They both went wide but you could just feel something was different. \"It was a really windy day, which you always get at the Britannia. Adam waited for Crouch to get into position and he just pitched the ball in the air so the big fella could get there in time and hit the target. Other than that, it wasn’t brilliant, not to be enjoyed. Jelavic was out, N’Doye was on the bench and Hull offered very little.

Saido Berahino's goal after 72 seconds sent West Brom to a 1-0 victory as Southampton's Champions League qualification hopes suffered a major blow. Berahino fired home a spectacular half-volley as the Hawthorns supporters were still taking their seats and although Saints had plenty of the ball on Saturday, Graziano Pelle was particularly wasteful in front of goal, missing a gilt-edged chance from three yards out. However, a superb showing from Berahino, who now has 17 goals this season, ended on a low note as he was taken off in the second half with an injury. West Brom were just one point away from safety when Tony Pulis took over on January 1 but they are now eight points clear of the relegation places and have kept five clean sheets in their last seven league games. Meanwhile, Southampton remain two points behind Arsenal in fifth place and have failed to score in their last three games. Ben Foster says West Brom are now able to grind out results and is delighted with how things are going under Tony Pulis Ben Foster says West Brom are now able to grind out results and is delighted with how things are going under Tony Pulis Saints boss Ronald Koeman recalled winger Sadio Mane to his starting line-up after dropping the Senegalese for Sunday's loss to Liverpool due to poor time keeping. He would have been hoping for a fast start from his team in a new-look 3-5-2 formation but it was West Brom that began with a bang. A long Chris Brunt free-kick was not dealt with much conviction by the Southampton defence but Berahino still had plenty to do as the ball dropped to him on his left foot just inside the area. He drew back his weaker foot and planted a wonderful strike into the top corner, with Southampton goalkeeper Fraser Forster left rooted to his spot. Ronald Koeman was left frustrated by Southampton's performance in their 1-0 away defeat to West Brom Ronald Koeman was left frustrated by Southampton's performance in their 1-0 away defeat to West Brom The home crowd behind the goal Southampton were attacking in the first half had to be on their guard throughout the opening period as the visitors created openings but were incredibly wayward with their finishing. Morgan Schneiderlin and Pelle were particularly wasteful with half-chances but the best opportunity fell to Mane on 26 minutes. However, he could only fire over from 15 yards after a superb cross-field pass from Schneiderlin. Referee Phil Dowd struggled to keep up with play in the first period and he was replaced at the break by fourth official Graham Scott owing to a calf injury. Southampton continued to dominate the ball after half-time but their play lacked fluency as West Brom's Joleon Lescott and Gareth McAuley dealt with everything that the visitors threw towards Pelle, who looked short on confidence. Tony Pulis praised West Brom's performance in their 1-0 win at home against Southampton Tony Pulis praised West Brom's performance in their 1-0 win at home against Southampton He has now not scored in the Premier League for 10 games and that was clear to see on 67 minutes when he fluffed his line from just three yards out. Ryan Bertrand made some great yards down the left flank and played a peach of a cross across the box that was asking to be gobbled up by Pelle but he missed his kick with the goal gaping. The impressive Darren Fletcher was a calming influence throughout the game and he nearly wrapped up the points with 12 minutes to play but he blazed over the bar from 15 yards. Substitute Eljero Elia had one last chance to nick a draw for the visitors in added time but he summed up his side’s finishing perfectly by wildly firing over from a tight angle.

You heard Koeman say after the Liverpool game that they were good in possession but they failed to create chances, and that was the same today. Players’ attempted shots on target failed to test the goalkeeper; they went high or wide. Koeman changed the system with three at the back with Bertrand and Clyne at wing backs, and we know those two get high anyway so there was no real need to play that system today. \"This is a difficult time for Southampton.

West Ham had held a two-goal lead through Cheikhou Kouyate and Diafra Sakho with 10 minutes remaining but Danny Rose's scuffed shot set up a grandstand finish and then Kane - brought down by Alex Song - struck at the second attempt, six minutes into time added on. Tottenham, who have earned 16 points from losing positions this season, remain three points off the top four in seventh, while the visitors sit a place back after being denied what would have been a first victory in four Premier League games. Kane - now with 24 goals to his name this season - was recalled alongside Moussa Dembele and Ryan Mason after starting the midweek draw against Fiorentina on the bench, boss Mauricio Pochettino keen to keep legs fresh for a gruelling schedule that includes next weekend's Capital One Cup final. The home side started the game brightly with Nabil Bentaleb recording the first shot on target in the eighth minute, Adrian pushing the ball around his right-hand post. Kane followed that up moments later when he tried to cheekily chip the West Ham keeper but failed to get a proper strike on the ball. Kouyate gave Sam Allardyce’s men the lead against the run of play in the 22nd minute. A good run down the left saw Aaron Cresswell deliver a pinpoint cross into the box and the midfielder outjumped Eric Dier and Jan Vertonghen to head home. Harry Kane missed an injury-time penalty but converted the rebound as Tottenham snatched a dramatic 2-2 draw against West Ham at White Hart Lane Harry Kane missed an injury-time penalty but converted the rebound as Tottenham snatched a dramatic 2-2 draw against West Ham at White Hart Lane Cresswell was causing problems again six minutes later but this time Spurs were alert to the danger and cleared the ball. Spurs struggled to create any real chances in the first-half and their passing looked disjointed as time went on. Enner Valencia should have doubled the visitors' lead just before the hour when he beat Kyle Walker for pace before unleashing a shot from just outside the box, but Dier and Vertonghen were there to block it with their bodies and keep the score at 1-0. Diafra Sakho: The striker celebrates after scoring his team's second goal against Tottenham West Ham finally increased their lead two minutes after the hour as Sakho got his first away goal since October 18. The forward started the move when his cross-shot bounced across the box and Mark Noble - on hand to pick up the loose ball - allowed Sakho to knock it past Hugo Lloris at the near post. That appeared to the belated impetus that Spurs needed as Kane had a goal ruled out for offside, before Adrian saved low to his left from substitute Christian Eriksen’s dipping free-kick. Nine minutes from time the assured Adrian made his first mistake of the game as he punched Erik Lamela’s shot away but mistimed his jump, allowing Rose’s effort to sneak in.

Nigel Pearson says Leicester's performance in their 2-2 draw against Everton deserved more than it got. It looked like Nigel Pearson's side were heading for victory until Romelu Lukaku's header deflected off Upson and into the net with just two minutes left. The result leaves the Foxes rooted to the foot of the Premier League table while Everton remain in 12th. Despite the late comeback, there were still some boos at the final whistle from the home fans, who have not seen their side win at Goodison Park in the league for more than two months. Esteban Cambiasso thinks if Leicester continue to play the way they did against Arsenal and Everton they will survive Esteban Cambiasso thinks if Leicester continue to play the way they did against Arsenal and Everton they will survive The visitors were largely the better side in a drab first half while Everton lacked any pace or purpose going forward. They wasted the couple of chances they did get as Lukaku fired over the bar and Ross Barkley curled a free-kick over. Andrej Kramaric came close at the other end when he curled a shot over while John Stones put in a last-ditch block to deny Schlupp in first-half injury-time. Leicester should have taken the lead shortly after the break but Schlupp dragged his shot wide after Howard parried Matty James' effort. Instead it was Everton who went ahead after 57 minutes as Naismith cut inside from the left and finished at the near post. Pearson replied by sending on Nugent and Vardy and the move soon paid dividends. Vardy did well to get away down the right and when his cross was spilled by Howard, Nugent was on hand to finish from close range. Lukaku missed a great opportunity to restore Everton’s lead minutes later as he failed to convert a one-on-one chance. And the hosts paid the price as the Foxes soon made it 2-1. Again Howard was at fault as he failed to clear a cross and Vardy pulled the ball back for Cambiasso to finish. The Everton fans groaned as Lukaku wasted yet another chance to score as the former Chelsea striker could only muster a weak shot after being played in by Naismith. But the Belgian made a telling impact in the dying minutes when his diving header hit Upson and flew in to steal a fortuitous point for Martinez's side.

Ronald Koeman says Southampton played better and had more chances than Liverpool in their 2-0 defeat and insists his team should have had a penalty Ronald Koeman says Southampton played better and had more chances than Liverpool in their 2-0 defeat and insists his team should have had a penalty Referee Kevin Friend was required to make a big call when Filip Djuricic, making his first start for Southampton, burst through on goal after just 30 seconds, only for Liverpool defender Emre Can to bundle the forward to the ground. The official waved away the home side’s vehement protests and minutes later Liverpool were ahead, courtesy of a wonder goal from their impish Brazil international. Picking up possession 25 yards out, Coutinho unleashed a fiercely struck effort that flew past a helpless Fraser Forster and into the back of the net off the underside of the crossbar. Southampton's Filip Djuricic says it is extremely disappointing to lose 2-0 against Liverpool and insists his side should have been awarded a penalty Southampton's Filip Djuricic says it is extremely disappointing to lose 2-0 against Liverpool and insists his side should have been awarded a penalty Ronald Koeman's men responded impressively to that setback, with Eljero Elia very nearly pulling them level straight from the restart following yet more appeals for a spot kick after a tug by Joe Allen on Djuricic, before a smart near-post stop with his feet by Simon Mignolet denied the Dutchman. There was yet more controversy just past the half-hour mark when Sterling, who had returned to the Liverpool starting line-up after injury, appeared to be tripped in the box by Southampton captain Jose Fonte, only for Friend to again wave play on. However, the officials did seem to get a crucial call wrong a minute before half-time when Elia broke clear of the visitors’ back four, only for the onrushing Mignolet to prevent the Netherlands international from equalising by handling the ball outside the area. Jordan Henderson says Liverpool knew they had to be at their best to beat Ronald Koeman's men and their 2-0 victory over Southampton was a huge win Jordan Henderson says Liverpool knew they had to be at their best to beat Ronald Koeman's men and their 2-0 victory over Southampton was a huge win The linesman deemed the ‘keeper not at fault and Liverpool escaped, as they also did in first-half injury time when a third Southampton appeal for a penalty was rejected after the ball appeared to stike Dejan Lovren’s hand in the box. After so many controversial incidents in the first half, it was almost inevitable the second period would be more sedate, and that is how it turned out as Southampton huffed and puffed, without ever threatening to get back on level terms. And it was Liverpool who scored the killer second goal on 73 minutes after taking full advantage of a catalogue of errors by the home team, before Sterling fired home from six yards out for what was his third strike in as many games against the Saints. Southampton tried to threaten a rousing finish, but the visitors’ impressive back line held firm to record a fifth straight clean sheet away from home in the league for the first time in 30 years.

Scott Sinclair had headed Villa’s 13th league goal of the season on 20 minutes to put Sherwood on course but Mame Biram Diouf powerfully headed Stoke level just moments before the half-time whistle and a late moment of madness from skipper Ron Vlaar proved pivotal. Tim Sherwood could not hide his disappointment after late defeat in his first game in charge of Aston Villa. Tim Sherwood could not hide his disappointment after late defeat in his first game in charge of Aston Villa. He received a second yellow card following a stoppage-time lunge on Moses in the box and the forward stepped up himself to snatch a vital victory for the Potters. Stoke stay in 10th despite the win, but if Sherwood was not aware of the mammoth task on his hands, he will now his side have dropped to 19th. Sherwood had promised endeavour and goals in his pre-match programme notes but it was a quiet start from both sides. Neither took control of the game but Villa got the early goal Sherwood craved when Sinclair, who scored his first goal since 2012 last week, opened the scoring. Stoke wanted a foul after Sinclair and Phil Bardsley tangled from a corner but the ball fell to Fabian Delph, who whipped a delightful cross in from the left for his team-mate to glance past Begovic from 12-yards.

Scott Sinclair refuses to dwell on Aston Villa's late defeat and says they must move get a win 'sooner, rather than later'. Villa negotiated any problems without causing Stoke any of their own, Christian Benteke well marshalled by the visiting defence, but as the game was ambling towards half-time, Stoke levelled out of the blue. Jon Walters teed up former Villa midfielder Ireland and his cross was powered in by Diouf from seven yards. It was a shock to the hosts' system, and after the break it was the same story, with Benteke remaining isolated and unable to make a decisive impact. Guzan punched away Jon Walters' angled volley yet there was nothing to suggest either side would grab a winner. Villa lacked the skill or know-how to unlock Stoke again although Begovic tipped over Gabriel Agbonlahor's header with two minutes left. Victor Moses delighted to grab winner for Stoke Victor Moses delighted to grab winner for Stoke But Villa imploded in injury-time when Vlaar's poor touch allowed Moses to steal the ball and burst into the area.

The league leaders had taken a 14th-minute lead thanks to Branislav Ivanovic’s fourth goal in his last six matches but Nemanja Matic was sent off with 20 minutes to go following an angry reaction to an Ashley Barnes tackle and the visitors drew level soon after through Ben Mee’s 81st-minute header. Matic, now set to miss next Sunday's Capital One Cup final against Tottenham, had to be restrained by John Terry and Kurt Zouma as he seethed at Barnes' lunge. Chelsea, at the end of a troubled week following events in Paris, will rue two points dropped after dominating for most of the game and allowing Manchester City to cut their lead to five, while manager Jose Mourinho will no doubt reflect on two strong penalty appeals in the first half that did not go their way. Jose Mourinho refused to talk about a series of controversial incidents at Stamford Bridge Jose Mourinho refused to talk about a series of controversial incidents at Stamford Bridge The home team were made to pay for not scoring the crucial second goal before Matic’s dismissal but Burnley - only in the relegation zone on goal difference - also deserve huge credit for keeping their star-studded opponents at bay for more than three-quarters of the contest. It had appeared to be business as usual going in at half-time with Chelsea deservedly in front courtesy of yet another key goal by their marauding right-back, although most of the credit must go to Eden Hazard. Sean Dyche praised the resilience of his Burnley team as they claimed a crucial point in their battle against relegation Sean Dyche praised the resilience of his Burnley team as they claimed a crucial point in their battle against relegation The Belgium international somehow managed to weave his way past a posse of Burnley players on the right-hand side of the penalty area, before picking out an unmarked Ivanovic six yards out, the Serb side-footing home his sixth goal of the season. Chelsea could have extended their advantage before the interval had referee Martin Atkinson upheld two strong penalty appeals, the first when Michael Kightly blocked Ivanovic’s goal-bound drive with his arm. Ben Mee delighted after his goal secured a point at Stamford Bridge Ben Mee delighted after his goal secured a point at Stamford Bridge Then in the final minute of the first half striker Diego Costa seemed to be hauled down by Burnley captain Jason Shackell as he sized up a shot on goal, only for the man in the middle to once again wave play on, much to Mourinho’s clear annoyance on the touchline. However, Chelsea kept on pushing forward after the break in search of that crucial second goal to kill off the spirited visitors, only for Costa, twice, and Matic to narrowly fail to convert half chances. Thibaut Courtois says Nemanja Matic's sending-off allowed Burnley to press for a late equaliser but insists a busy fixture schedule cannot be blamed Thibaut Courtois says Nemanja Matic's sending-off allowed Burnley to press for a late equaliser but insists a busy fixture schedule cannot be blamed And the game was then completely turned on its head after 70 minutes when Matic reacted furiously to a dangerous studs-high tackle on him by Burnley striker Ashley Barnes, the holding midfielder shoved his opponent to the ground in a fit of anger. Referee Atkinson had no choice but to issue Matic with a straight red card, with his compatriot Ivanovic also booked after trying to prevent the official for brandishing his card, although how Barnes managed to stay on the pitch is still a mystery. The visitors, though, sensed their opportunity to draw level, and after Thibaut Courtois had produced a brilliant one-handed save to deny Barnes, Mee rose high at the back post to head home Kieran Trippier's left-wing corner for just the left back’s second goal in the last three years, and only the second Chelsea had conceded at home in the league since 1 November. Paul Merson's verdict The referee gets it all wrong. You have to use common sense, as Barnes could have broken Matic's leg and so the natural reaction is he’s going to get up and push him. And the referee did not even book Barnes, while he did caution Ivanovic for arguing. Surely the referee should not have seen it? But if he does, he has to send him off though. He had a terrible game, with two stonewall penalties missed as well. For me, I am not sure what you are meant to do and I think everyone in the world of football would have that sort of reaction, as you are going to be frustrated.

Olivier Giroud goals see off Crystal Palace 2-1 and send Arsenal third Santi Cazorla celebrates after scoring a penalty against Crystal Palace Arsenal moved up to third in the Premier League after a hard-fought 2-1 win at Crystal Palace. First-half goals from Santi Cazorla and Olivier Giroud gave the Gunners all three points but the scoreline did not tell the full story for Crystal Palace. Alan Pardew’s men caused plenty of problems for Arsenal’s defence all afternoon with Dwight Gayle, Jason Puncheon and substitute Glenn Murray all going close in the second half. Santi Cazorla celebrates scoring Arsenal's opener at Crystal Palace Palace finally grabbed a goal in the final minute of added time as Murray scrambled the ball home and he had the chance to secure an unlikely point in the dying seconds but the striker's header rebounded off the post. But Arsene Wenger’s side held on amid the Palace onslaught for a vital eighth victory in nine matches to keep the pressure on in the race for the top four. It was Crystal Palace who made the brighter start to proceedings but did not have anything to show for it when Pape Souare, making his Premier League debut for the club, lost the ball to Danny Welbeck, before bringing down the England striker right on the edge of the penalty area. Wilfried Zaha holds off the challenege of Alexis Sanchez and Nacho Monreal Mark Clattenburg, with the help of his assistant, pointed to the spot and Cazorla sent Julian Speroni the wrong way to score his seventh goal of the season with just eight minutes on the clock. It was not the start Pardew would have wanted but he would have been encouraged by his side’s high-energy display as they continued to ask plenty of questions of Arsenal. Wilfried Zaha was particularly lively for the hosts, causing left-back Nacho Monreal all sorts of problems, but the end product remained elusive, Gayle particularly wasteful from set-piece situations. It was to come back to haunt them as Arsenal doubled their advantage in added time of the first half, Speroni parrying Welbeck’s goal-bound shot and Giroud reacting quickest to stab home his 50th Arsenal goal. Olivier Giroud scores his 50th Arsenal goal at Crystal Palace Pardew’s men came out firing on all cylinders after the break with Zaha still at the heart of much of their good work, but Arsenal looked particularly dangerous on the counter-attack. In the 56th minute, Arsenal sprung forward through Mesut Ozil, who held the ball up brilliantly before producing an inch-perfect pass for Alexis Sanchez. The Chilean forward lifted the ball over Speroni but it drifted just wide of the far post. Wilfried Zaha and Yannick Bolasie: Praised how Alan Pardew has let them express themselves Wilfried Zaha and Yannick Bolasie: Praised how Alan Pardew has let them express themselves Wenger would have been wondering whether that miss would prove to be costly as Palace went in search of a foothold in the game and they nearly had it when David Ospina charged of his line, Zaha unable to turn in substitute Yannick Bolasie’s cross. Gayle went close soon after, getting in front of Per Mertesacker to head goalwards, but the ball flew inches over the cross bar just before Puncheon’s free-kick beat Ospina all ends up but flew inches past the post. Pardew threw on Shola Ameobi and Murray with 15 minutes to go and the move had the desired effect as the latter pulled a goal in the 94th minute back for the hosts. Glenn Murray grabs a consolation for Crystal Palace That proved too late, though Murray went agonisingly close at the death when he got his head on Bolasie’s cross, only for the ball to come crashing back off the post.

Hull made the early running, though, and much of their good work came through Ahmed Elmohamady down the right with strikers N’Doye and Jelavic the target. It was a QPR mistake in the 16th minute that led to them conceding the first goal.

Sunderland and West Brom played out a drab goalless draw at the Stadium of Light, a result that will do little to ease the pressure on Black Cats boss Gus Poyet. Coming into the game on the back of a humiliating FA Cup exit to Bradford, the hosts knew a victory would take them above their in-form opponents in the Premier League table. But despite being the better side and looking the more likely to find a winner as the game went on a Santiago Vergini header in the second half was the best Poyet's men could muster. Sunderland, unable to find the back of the net - legitimately, at least - for the third game in a row, will point to two questionable decisions from referee Mike Jones in the first period as potentially being the difference between a much-needed win and a draw . Gus Poyet berates officials Gus Poyet berates officials Mr Jones opted not to send off last man Joleon Lescott despite awarding a foul for his early challenge on Danny Graham on the advice of assistant Constantine Hatzidakis, who then raised an offside flag to deny Adam Johnson a 45th-minute opener. Poyet had pleaded with fans to get behind the team in an open letter earlier in the week and urged his players to give the crowd something to shout about and the game was just five minutes old when Cattermole played striker Graham in behind Lescott. Graham looked to be clear, but he went to ground as the defender recovered, and the home supporters were on their feet calling for blood as the flag went up. Jones produced only a yellow card and replays suggested there had been little contact, but there was a tangible sense of injustice as Sebastian Larsson curled the resulting free-kick into the side-netting. Unspectacular The half unfolded in unspectacular fashion thereafter, with Lee Cattermole adding steel and opposite number Darren Fletcher probing for the Baggies, although with little success. James Morrison curled an eighth-minute shot on the turn into goalkeeper Costel Pantilimon's arms, but that was the Romanian's only notable action of the opening 45 minutes. Baggies midfielder Claudio Yacob was perhaps fortunate to escape without further action when he was lectured by the referee for pushing Defoe to the ground inside the penalty area for the second time while the pair awaited delivery of a corner. However, that was not the end of the controversy as the home side were denied what they felt was a perfectly good goal on the stroke of half-time. Ricky Alvarez crossed from the right to the far post, where Johnson controlled before rounding Ben Foster and stabbing home, only for a harsh offside flag to end his celebrations. Tony Pulis happy with goalless draw Tony Pulis happy with goalless draw Larsson forced a diving save from Foster deep into injury time, but the stalemate remained. Sunderland resumed where they had left off after the break, dominating possession, however West Brom's organisation left little space to exploit. Full-back Chris Brunt had to block a 55th-minute Alvarez drive after the Argentina international cut inside on to his left foot, and Craig Dawson had to be equally determined to repel Defoe's effort six minutes later. The home side should have gone ahead from the resulting corner when full-back Vergini met Larsson's cross unopposed, but he glanced his header wide of the far post. As the game entered its final quarter, Poyet sent strikers Connor Wickham and Steven Fletcher on for Graham and Alvarez, and Wickham very nearly made a swift impact when he saw Foster bundle away his header from Johnson's 76th-minute corner, and that was as good as it got as the last push fell short.

Bafetimbi Gomis' slight touch on 73 minutes proved to be difference, with Jonjo Shelvey's powerful 25-yard drive deflecting off the striker's head to fly past David de Gea. Van Gaal's side had benefited from a deflection of their own in the first half to take the lead through Ander Herrera with 28 minutes gone, but Ki Sung-yueng levelled just two minutes later and Gomis completed the turnaround to inflict only a second defeat since November on United. Wayne Rooney believes Manchester United outplayed Swansea in their 2-1 defeat at the Liberty Stadium Wayne Rooney believes Manchester United outplayed Swansea in their 2-1 defeat at the Liberty Stadium Herrera's arrowed shot, which skimmed Ashley Williams' boot to find the corner, was the result of a flowing passing move between Luke Shaw, Wayne Rooney and Angel di Maria, who played a perfect final ball for the goalscorer. Swansea had twice threatened through Gomis - who had a header cleared off the line by Herrera - and responded swiftly to the setback. Ki Sung-Yueng beat Shaw to Shelvey's cross and steered the ball past De Gea.

Wilfried Bony came on for his debut as City withdrew key players with Tuesday’s clash with Barcelona in mind, and the hosts completed an emphatic win to move back within five points of Chelsea, after the Blues were held at home by Burnley earlier in the day. Newcastle - ensconced in mid-table - had gone three games unbeaten but have now suffered 11 Premier League defeats to City in a row. The game started in the worst possible way for Carver’s men, as Vurnon Anita’s loose touch allowed Dzeko to come in and steal the ball before he was then brought down by the Newcastle midfielder, and the referee pointed to the spot inside 30 seconds. Aguero stepped up and coolly sent the ball low to Krul’s left with the goalkeeper rooted to the spot, and City never looked back. John Carver left to rue Newcastle's slow start at the Etihad Stadium John Carver left to rue Newcastle's slow start at the Etihad Stadium The visitors had plenty of possession but couldn’t make an impact at the other end, and they were soon 2-0 down as Dzeko was again involved, racing down the left before his deflected cross found Nasri, and the Frenchman calmly worked himself some space before firing into the roof of the net to double City’s lead after just 12 minutes. Things went from bad to worse for Carver’s men – for whom the 2-0 Capital One Cup win here in October must have seemed a distant memory – as nine minutes later it was 3-0. Silva floated a stunning ball over the top and Dzeko brought it down superbly before firing past Krul. Quick double City started the second half as well as they did the first, and it was 4-0 six minutes after the break, Silva receiving it off Nasri and curling it into the far corner.

The Spaniard then grabbed his second of the afternoon just two minutes later, as Aguero chested down Toure’s lofted pass and Silva latched on to it, firing a low first-time shot into the corner from the edge of the box. With their Champions League last-16 tie on Tuesday, Pellegrini brought off some of his key figures, and Bony was one of the men introduced, making his City debut in a 30-minute cameo.

seven-point lead after 1-0 win over Everton but Branislav Ivanovic escapes punishment in melee Willian (L): Scored winner in 89th minute to maintain Chelsea's lead Chelsea maintained their seven-point lead at the top of the Premier League with a last-gasp 1-0 win over Everton in a tempestuous clash at Stamford Bridge. Willian broke the deadlock in the 89th minute when his smart volley from outside the penalty area deflected off Steven Naismith and sneaked past Tim Howard. The match-winning goal came moments after Gareth Barry was sent off for a second yellow card - but in the same melee, Branislav Ivanovic avoided any sanction for an apparent attempted headbutt on James McCarthy. Tony Cottee says Chelsea did just about enough to deserve all three points against Everton Tony Cottee says Chelsea did just about enough to deserve all three points against Everton Chelsea were repeatedly denied by Howard on his first appearance since picking up a calf injury on Boxing Day, but looked to have taken the lead in the second half when Nemanja Matic fired into the net from the edge of the box. The goal was disallowed, however, after the ball bounced off Ivanovic on its way past the Everton goalkeeper and the assistant referee flagged for offside. Everton also had chances to take the lead after the break. Romelu Lukaku connected with Bryan Oviedo’s fizzing cross from close range but Petr Cech was quick to react, saving with his feet to keep the score level. Jose Mourinho speaks at the post-match press conference Jose Mourinho speaks at the post-match press conference Chelsea could have opened the scoring in the first half. Matic and Willian fired early efforts over the bar from the edge of the penalty area, before Lukaku hit back for Everton with a low drive straight at Cech. Chelsea continued to press before the break and Eden Hazard narrowly failed to connect with Cesar Azpilicueta’s floated cross. The Belgian then hit a powerful strike that Howard gathered at the second attempt, with Lukaku following his compatriot’s lead and testing Cech again from distance. Everton sent on Kevin Mirallas in the closing stages and the winger immediately fired over from distance.

Man Utd's Chris Smalling said he was pleased to find the net twice in his side's 3-1 win over Burnley Man Utd's Chris Smalling said he was pleased to find the net twice in his side's 3-1 win over Burnley Ings missed two close-range chances and Ashley Barnes fired wide, but the visitors’ challenge faded as the game went on and United continued their fine run of home form. The result moves United back above Arsenal and Southampton into third place as they made it three Premier League wins in their last four outings. Burnley gave the hosts an early warning as Michael Keane headed a glorious chance wide from a corner, before Van Gaal’s men opened the scoring from a set piece of their own. Seconds after Phil Jones limped off and Smalling replaced him, the defender rose high to meet Radamel Falcao’s header back across the box from a United corner, and he nodded into the net to put the hosts in front inside six minutes. Louis van Gaal said his side were not at their best despite running out 3-1 winners Louis van Gaal said his side were not at their best despite running out 3-1 winners Their lead didn’t last long, though, as red-hot striker Ings levelled things six minutes later, meeting Kieran Trippier’s superb ball in from the right to power a diving header past David de Gea and into the top corner.

An Ings volley was parried away before Barnes went close as he fired a first-time shot just wide of De Gea’s post. Super sub But it was Van Gaal’s side who led at the break as Smalling grabbed his second three minutes into first-half stoppage time, meeting Angel Di Maria’s cross at the far post and nodding into the net past a helpless Tom Heaton. Burnley boss Sean Dyche was full of praise for his side Burnley boss Sean Dyche was full of praise for his side Ings had a chance to level things shortly after the break as his flick for George Boyd set the visitors away. Boyd’s cross from the right was missed by two defenders, but Ings could only hit his shot straight at the goalkeeper. Neither side could make much of an impact as the game wore on, but the killer blow came on 82 minutes as Di Maria raced into the box and Scott Arfield brought him down. The referee pointed to the spot to award United their first penalty of the season, which Van Persie hammered into the corner of the net. Di Maria then hit a shot straight at Heaton before Adnan Januzaj saw his low shot cleared off the line with the goalkeeper beaten, but it wouldn’t matter as the hosts completed their victory to go back up into third place.

Adrian was sent off on the hour mark after Sadio Mane got the better of him and he handled the ball outside the area. But though it looked like the home side - who had 20 shots on target - would get the winner goal their possession deserved, two late saves from substitute Jussi Jaaskelainen ensured the Saints had to settle for their first goalless draw since August. Sam Allardyce will be happy with the point but concerned as Andy Carroll, having only returned from injury at the weekend, limped through the last 10 minutes of the game. Southampton - who slip a place to fourth - started the game like a side keen to cement themselves in the Champions League places and West Ham spent the first 20 minutes under pressure. It was Saints midfielder Victor Wanyama who had the first chance, from 25 yards out, but he swung at the ball and it flew yards over the bar. Ronald Koeman says his side’s attacking play was not good enough in the 0-0 draw against West Ham Ronald Koeman says his side’s attacking play was not good enough in the 0-0 draw against West Ham Mane followed that up in the 15th minute when he collected Steven Davis’ cross from the right and ran into the box. He managed to knock it past Adrian at his near post but Carl Jenkinson was there to clear it. It was the start of a very bad evening for the Spanish goalkeeper. Mane had another chance just moments later and this time Carlton Cole saved his teammate after Adrian completely missed the ball when he came out to clear. Eljero Elia was the next forward to have a go as he beat the offside trap, but Jenkinson was alert to the danger and after being closed down, the Dutch international sent his shot wide. Sam Allardyce did not agree with the referee’s decision to send off goalkeeper Adrian Sam Allardyce did not agree with the referee’s decision to send off goalkeeper Adrian Allardyce made the first changes; bringing on Matt Jarvis for Enner Valencia after the break - even though the summer signing had mustered the Hammers' only shot on target. The visitors altered their shape and though it looked like the plan was to send longer balls in for Carroll - on for Diafra Sakho - the striker spent more time clearing the ball out of his own area. West Ham’s chances came on the break, as Adrian’s long free-kick found Stewart Downing but he could only send his shot over. Adrian’s rush of blood came on the hour when Mane, who had been lively all game, nicked the ball from his grasp. The pair battled for it, only for Adrian to panic and flick the ball away with his hand outside the area, leading referee Pawson to dish out a straight red card. Paul Merson says Southampton are missing a bit of their early season spark and they need to get Graziano Pelle scoring again Paul Merson says Southampton are missing a bit of their early season spark and they need to get Graziano Pelle scoring again Jaaskelainen came on in place of Cole and exuded experience as he twice saved from Graziano Pelle, before thwarting Jose Fonte at his right hand post.

team-mate Pablo Zabaleta Manchester City returned to winning ways in impressive style as they produced a brilliant second-half display to beat Stoke City 4-1 at the Britannia. Sergio Aguero gave the Premier League champions the lead in the 33rd minute with a brilliant solo effort but Stoke quickly replied through Peter Crouch’s stooping header. City played with more purpose after the break and James Milner headed them back in front before a penalty from Aguero and a fine strike from Samir Nasri sealed victory. Manuel Pellegrini was delighted that his side managed to score four goals and get back to their best Manuel Pellegrini was delighted that his side managed to score four goals and get back to their best The win was City’s first in the league since New Year’s Day but they remain seven points behind Chelsea, who won 1-0 against Everton. While a successful title defence still looks a tough ask, Manuel Pellegrini will be buoyed by his side's second-half display – and the imminent return of Yaya Toure and arrival of Wilfried Bony. The champions had not won in the league while the pair were away at the Africa Cup of Nations and it looked like being another tricky night at Stoke as they were put under plenty of pressure early on. After Aguero squandered a good opening for the visitors, Stoke had strong appeals for a penalty waved away when Crouch’s header from a corner appeared to hit Milner’s arm. After going a goal down, Mark Hughes says Stoke left themselves open to counter attacks After going a goal down, Mark Hughes says Stoke left themselves open to counter attacks Crouch then had the ball in the net after a fumble from Joe Hart, only for it to be ruled out for offside, before the Man City keeper beat away a shot from Steven N’Zonzi and Victor Moses smashed the rebound narrowly wide. Stoke were made to rue the missed chances in the 33rd minute as Aguero scored a superb solo effort, seizing on a long clearance, running at the defence and then finishing with a fine shot across goal. But City had not yet weathered the storm and Stoke replied almost immediately as Marko Arnautovic curled in an excellent cross from the right and Crouch stooped to head home. The goal was Crouch's 45th headed goal in the Premier League and puts him just one behind Alan Shearer's record. James Milner says he's relieved that Manchester City have managed to break their duck against Stoke James Milner says he's relieved that Manchester City have managed to break their duck against Stoke The visitors thought they had reclaimed the lead just before the interval, only for Aguero to instead be booked for a bizarre handball. It looked as though the Argentine would finish easily from David Silva’s cross but after heading the ball goalwards he then knocked it in with his hand when it seemed to be going into the net anyway. Nevertheless, it didn’t take City long in the second half to regain the lead as they came out with more purpose and started to take control of the contest. Phil Thompson says Manchester City's players must have been given a rocket at half-time Phil Thompson says Manchester City's players must have been given a rocket at half-time Milner, the saviour against Hull at the weekend, made it 2-1 as he rose to meet a Nasri cross 10 minutes after the break. Pellegrini's men went further ahead after 70 minutes as Silva proved too tricky for Geoff Cameron and was clearly pulled down in the box. Aguero clinically dispatched the spot kick and Nasri made sure of victory six minutes later as he drove at the Stoke defence, checked inside on the edge of the area and fired a shot across goal and in at the far post. City could have had a fifth as Edin Dzeko wasted a good opening while Mame Biram Diouf threatened on the break for Stoke but didn’t test Hart.

against Newcastle Crystal Palace and Newcastle played out a 1-1 draw at Selhurst Park on Wednesday night in Alan Pardew’s first meeting with his old club. Palace boss Pardew said his side should have gone on to win the game Palace boss Pardew said his side should have gone on to win the game The visitors had led at the break through top-scorer Papiss Cisse’s 10th goal in just 16 Premier League games this season on what was the Senegal striker’s first start for the club since December. But Pardew – who endured some unsavoury chants from the away end – saw his side deservedly draw level after 71 minutes thanks to substitute Fraizer Campbell’s well-taken strike. Palace, who have now taken 10 points from a possible 15 under Pardew, sit 13th in the table, two places behind Newcastle. Newcastle boss Carver said playing against his old colleague Pardew made things slightly more difficult Newcastle boss Carver said playing against his old colleague Pardew made things slightly more difficult The home side had dominated the opening 45 minutes without ever really testing Tim Krul in the Newcastle goal, despite Campbell correctly having a goal ruled out for offside, before finding themselves 1-0 down three minutes before half-time following the visitors’ first shot on goal. Picking up possession midway in the Palace half on the right wing, Daryl Janmaat’s skil took him past the backtracking Wilfried Zaha, before the Netherlands international’s inch-perfect centre from the byline was headed powerfully past Julian Speroni at his near post by Cisse. That strike forced Palace to throw caution to the wind in the second half, and even more so after the double introduction of both leading-scorer Dwight Gayle and Yannick Bolasie – back from the Africa Cup of Nations – with a quarter of the game remaining. Newcastle's Papiss Cisse heads past Julian Speroni of Crystal Palace But it was the latter’s appearance which really seemed to stir Palace into life as Bolasie created his side’s equaliser with virtually his first touch since replacing left-back Martin Kelly, his brilliant curling centre toe-poked home by the unmarked Campbell – who had replaced the injured Yaya Sanogo midway through the first half – from six yards out. A Palace winner looked inevitable, only for Pardew’s men to be denied twice late on by heroic Newcastle defending. Newcastle's Janmaat said his side dug deep to earn a point against Palace Newcastle's Janmaat said his side dug deep to earn a point against Palace With 15 minutes remaining, and again after yet more enterprising wing play by Bolasie, Zaha saw his fiercely-struck effort from the edge of the area blocked by the onrushing Janmaat. And then, right at the very death, Palace centre-back Brede Hangeland rose majestically to head Jason Puncheon’s right-wing centre goalwards, only for Krul to somehow claw his effort wide of the post.

Celebrates scoring Arsenal's opener Arsenal saw off a resilient Leicester side as they registered a 2-1 victory at the Emirates on Tuesday night and climbed back into the Champions League places. First-half goals from Laurent Koscielny and Theo Walcott put the hosts in a commanding position at the break, before Andrej Kramaric pulled one back for Leicester. Theo Walcott and Laurent Koscielny were the scorers for Arsenal Theo Walcott and Laurent Koscielny were the scorers for Arsenal Riyad Mahrez and Kramaric had chances to level for the visitors, but Arsenal held on to make it 22 home games unbeaten against the Foxes in all competitions. The result leaves Leicester rooted to the bottom of the Premier League table, while Arsenal move into fourth place above Manchester United, with Louis van Gaal’s men playing Burnley on Wednesday night. The visitors had the brighter start of the two, with Mahrez causing problems early on. The midfielder saw one shot deflected wide before drilling another effort across the face of goal as Arsenal looked nervy in the opening stages. But Arsene Wenger’s men soon found their rhythm, and Walcott latched on to Mesut Ozil’s pass before failing to beat Mark Schwarzer with his chipped effort, then Alexis Sanchez headed over from the resulting corner. Ozil was soon involved again, drilling a low shot which Schwarzer tipped wide, before firing in a corner towards the near post, where Koscielny raced in unmarked to volley low inside the upright and break the deadlock after 27 minutes. Nigel Pearson feels Leicester's performance at the Emirates should have resulted in some points Nigel Pearson feels Leicester's performance at the Emirates should have resulted in some points Leicester continued to have the occasional move forwards, and the dangerous Mahrez curled a 20-yard effort just wide of the target, but on 41 minutes they fell further behind. Ozil drilled a 30-yard shot towards the top corner which Schwarzer saved well, but parried it straight towards Walcott, who fired an excellent first-time volley into the corner of the net. Comeback Nigel Pearson's future looked uncertain earlier in the week but his half-time team talk seemed to have a profound effect on his players, particularly Kramaric, who fired one shot straight at the goalkeeper before putting the hosts back in the game on 61 minutes. Esteban Cambiasso battled to keep the ball in the box and fired it across the area, where it eventually broke for the striker, and Kramaric drilled a low shot inside David Ospina’s near post to pull one back. The comeback was nearly complete as the impressive Mahrez picked up a loose ball and raced towards the edge of the box, bending a low shot inches wide of the upright. Arsene Wenger thinks Arsenal's spirit got them the win after a strong Leicester performance Arsene Wenger thinks Arsenal's spirit got them the win after a strong Leicester performance Kramaric then had another excellent chance of his own as Mahrez swept forward on the break, playing the ball into the striker, who tried to chip Ospina but could only play it straight into the goalkeeper’s arms. Pearson threw on Leonardo Ulloa and David Nugent as he searched for an equaliser, but the visitors eventually paid for their missed chances as Arsenal saw the game out to take the points.

against Aston Villa Aston Villa dropped into the Premier League relegation zone after a disappointing 2-0 defeat at Hull City on Tuesday night. Aston Villa manager Paul Lambert says losing 2-0 at Hull was disappointing Aston Villa manager Paul Lambert says losing 2-0 at Hull was disappointing Debutant Dame N'Doye proved the key figure in a scrappy contest, setting up Nikica Jelavic's 22nd-minute opener before scoring himself to secure only a third home win of the season. The Tigers move up to 15th in the table but Villa, whose fans held up a 'Lambert Out' banner for most of the match, slip into the bottom three following a fifth straight defeat. Villa came into the clash without a victory in their last nine league games but after an improved performance against league leaders Chelsea at the weekend, the travelling support were expecting a more spirited showing than they have had to endure of late. Dame N'Doye says it was a great experience to play his first game at the KC Stadium Dame N'Doye says it was a great experience to play his first game at the KC Stadium However, from the word go, Lambert's side lacked a cutting edge, and it was deadline-day signing N’Doye who gave the game some attacking intent. Goalkeeper Allan McGregor launched the ball upfield where N'Doye cushioned it with a neat first touch before threading a pass for Jelavic. He shot low, but was fortunate to see the ball loop gently into the roof of the net after a huge deflection off Ciaran Clark. Villa offered little in return. They had a solitary chance to level before the break, Tom Huddlestone conceding a free-kick in an inviting position, but Carles Gil's effort curled a yard wide. Steve Bruce thinks his players' confidence was key in Hull's win over Aston Villa Steve Bruce thinks his players' confidence was key in Hull's win over Aston Villa After the interval it was more of the same. Lambert made the logical switch at half-time, Christian Benteke coming on for the ineffective Andreas Weimann. Villa needed the Belgian to rediscover his best form, but he was again starved of service. Robbie Brady shot just wide as Hull looked to extend their lead but the home fans didn't have to wait long to have their nerves settled. Ahmed Elmohamady's cross and Gaston Ramirez's header combined to pick out N'Doye at the far post and although his instinctive first attempt was smothered at point-blank range by Brad Guzan, the Senegalese hitman slotted his second attempt coolly into the net 16 minutes from time. Dame N'Doye: Competes for the ball with Ciaran Clark McGregor denied Villa a much-needed goal, beating out Ashley Westwood's drive then recovering to palm Benteke's follow-up over the bar in the dying embers of the match, but Lambert's men must realise quickly they are involved in a relegation battle, and have to improve quickly.

QPR moved out of the relegation zone after recording their first away points of the season with a 2-0 win at Sunderland. Chairman Tony Fernandes might be closing in on his \"dream\" new manager following the departure of Harry Redknapp but caretakers Chris Ramsey and Kevin Bond were the men who oversaw a first result on the road after 11 successive defeats. Bobby Zamora says QPR's 2-0 win over Sunderland was a huge boost and they will now look to keep the momentum going Bobby Zamora says QPR's 2-0 win over Sunderland was a huge boost and they will now look to keep the momentum going The west Londoners had the game sewn up by half-time, thanks to Leroy Fer, who was later taken off with a knee injury, and a corking half-volley from Bobby Zamora. QPR made six changes to the side that lost 1-0 at home to Southampton as Ramsey spoke of introducing more flair and attacking momentum to their game. Top scorer Charlie Austin was missing with a foot injury but Zamora was a more than an adequate replacement, using his skilled hold-up play to lay the foundations for some early QPR pressure. Sunderland manager Gus Poyet says his side paid the price for not starting the game well Sunderland manager Gus Poyet says his side paid the price for not starting the game well That pressure told on 17 minutes when Matt Phillips was given far too much space on the right flank to deliver a wonderful cross straight onto the head of the impressive Fer, who thumped the ball into the top corner. Fer then came close to doubling lead on 29 minutes when he once again latched onto a Phillips cross but this time his cushioned right-footed effort hit the inside of the post and rolled along the goal line and away to safety. QPR goalkeeper Rob Green was then called into action four minutes later to deny Connor Wickham with a splendid double save. Wickham’s first effort from six yards was pushed onto the bar by Green, who then reacted quicker than anyone to scoop the ball off the line. QPR caretaker manager Chris Ramsey says their 2-0 win over Sunderland has been a long time coming QPR caretaker manager Chris Ramsey says their 2-0 win over Sunderland has been a long time coming That would have given the home fans plenty of hope for a comeback but Zamora soon put pay to that optimism with a stunning goal on the stroke of half-time. Phillips again was the man with the assist from the right flank but all the plaudits have to go to Zamora, who hit the ball first time on the turn with his weaker right foot. Sunderland goalkeeper Costel Pantilimon could only stand and stare as the ball flew into the top corner. The hosts stepped up their attacking intent in the second period but everything they threw at QPR was thwarted by a combination of Green and Rio Ferdinand. Rob Green says the mood in QPR's dressing room is one of relief Rob Green says the mood in QPR's dressing room is one of relief The ‘keeper denied Jermain Defoe his third goal in three games with a point-blank save on 63 minutes and then flew across his goal three minutes later to claw away a dangerous Ricky Alvarez effort. Ferdinand summed up his team’s commitment with 10 minutes to play with a fine block in the six yard box to stop a certain Steven Fletcher goal. QPR, who had lost all 12 away games in all competitions this season, send Aston Villa into the bottom three and keep Sunderland - now just two points above the drop zone - in trouble. But while the visitors shook off one unwanted record, Joey Barton picked up one of his own after being booked for the seventh successive match - a Premier League first.

seven minutes remaining to give Liverpool a 3-2 win over Tottenham at Anfield. The Italian came on as a substitute and turned home from close range to hand Liverpool all three points after an entertaining encounter in which Spurs had twice come from behind. Lazar Markovic gave the hosts the lead with a low effort from just inside the area, before Harry Kane scored his fifth goal in three games as his shot from 12 yards out went through Simon Mignolet’s legs. Colin Pascoe says Mario Balotelli deserved the winning goal in their 3-2 win Colin Pascoe says Mario Balotelli deserved the winning goal in their 3-2 win Steven Gerrard regained Liverpool’s lead from the penalty spot after Daniel Sturridge was brought down by Danny Rose, but Mousa Dembele levelled again on 61 minutes before Balotelli’s late winner. The result leaves Liverpool in seventh, but the Reds are now just a point behind sixth-placed Tottenham. On his return to the starting line up, Sturridge looked sharp during a frantic opening. He broke free of the Spurs defence, but his low shot from 12 yards to Hugo Lloris’ right was saved well. A minute later, Gerrard’s free-kick from 25 yards went inches over Lloris’ bar, before the French goalkeeper did superbly well to keep out Sturridge’s blistering shot from eight yards as the ball fell to the Englishman kindly. Liverpool's Lazar Markovic is congratulated after scoring the opening Liverpool’s pressing resulted in a goal on 15 minutes, the ball finding its way to Markovic on the left from Sturridge’s hold up play for the Serb to fire home into the bottom right corner through the grasp of Lloris, who could have done better. But 11 minutes later the visitors were level through Kane, the striker turning well inside the area from Erik Lamela’s deft pass and finishing fortunately through Simon Mignolet’s legs. It was Kane’s 23rd goal of the season in all competitions, and his eighth since the turn of the year. Sturridge was unlucky not to give Liverpool the lead going into half-time, flicking the ball with his back to goal from six yards out only to see his fine piece of improvisation hit the post. Liverpool were given a penalty after half-time when Sturridge was brought down by Rose’s flailing leg, giving Gerrard the chance to slot past Lloris high into the top right corner. Harry Kane celebrates his equaliser in the first half Lamela went close a minute after the goal, forcing a fine save from Mignolet from 25 yards, but Spurs levelled for a second time just after the hour. Christian Eriksen’s free-kick was parried by Mignolet allowing Kane, who looked in an offside position, to centre for Dembele to turn home from four yards out. But the last word went to Balotelli, who had only scored twice for Liverpool since joining from AC Milan in the summer. Brendan Rodgers brought the summer signing on with 16 mintues remaining, and he repaid his manager by turning home the winner after another sub, Adam Lallana, found him four yards out. It had taken him seven months, 14 appearances, and 48 shots to score his first goal for the club in the top flight. Danny Rose cuts across to try to tackle Markovic The win means Liverpool have lost just two games in 21 in all competitions, moving them to within three points of fourth place.

set-pieces as West Brom come from behind to draw Brown Ideye was the unlikely hero as West Brom came from behind to draw 2-2 against Burnley at Turf Moor. Ashley Barnes and Danny Ings had given the hosts a 2-0 lead but Chris Brunt halved the deficit moments before the break and then Ideye - who almost left the club in the final hours of the transfer window - came off the bench to salvage a point with a 67th-minute header. It is the second time in the last three games that Burnley have failed to take maximum points after holding a two-goal lead but they move a point clear of the relegation zone, while West Brom are now three clear of trouble. Sean Dyche says Burnley’s 2-2 draw against West Brom is another step in the right direction despite the side losing a 2-0 lead. Sean Dyche says Burnley’s 2-2 draw against West Brom is another step in the right direction despite the side losing a 2-0 lead. Tony Pulis had made three changes, including dropping Saido Berahino after the young forward spoke publicly about a desire to move away from the club this summer. The visitors could not cope with Sean Dyche’s energetic team in the first half and Scott Arfield - via a wonderful Ben Foster fingertip save - rattled the crossbar inside seven minutes. But the home fans would have to wait only four more minutes for a goal when Ings mesmerised the West Brom defence with a sublime dummy to Arfield and then a precise cross that allowed Barnes to head home. Berahino was thrown into the action on 17 minutes to replace an injured Victor Anichebe but he had little impact on proceedings as Burnley continued to dominate. Tony Pulis says West Brom started their game against Burnley far too slowly but Chris Brunt’s goal before half time gave them the lift they needed to earn Tony Pulis says West Brom started their game against Burnley far too slowly but Chris Brunt’s goal before half time gave them the lift they needed to earn Ings, whose contract is up in the summer, was a constant menace in the opening period and he was on hand to double the lead on 32 minutes. Brunt allowed George Boyd to keep a ball in play down the right flank and he sent over a wonderful cross that was met first time by the striker. The ball flew into the top corner and it looked a long way back for the sloppy visitors. However, West Brom nicked a momentum-boosting goal just before half-time when a whipped-in corner found Brunt unmarked six yards from goal and he diverted the ball into the net off the underside of the crossbar. Pulis switched his formation at the break, playing Berahino and Stephane Sessegnon just behind the substitute striker Ideye, who replaced defender Chris Baird. The switch worked wonders as West Brom grew into the game and the pressure finally told midway through the half. Joleon Lescott had gone close from a Brunt corner just seconds before the Northern Irishman found Ideye with a pint-point delivery, the substitute losing his marker and thumping his header home. Ashley Barnes says despite drawing 2-2 with West Brom, it feels like a defeat after Burnley threw away a 2-0 lead for the third time. Ashley Barnes says despite drawing 2-2 with West Brom, it feels like a defeat after Burnley threw away a 2-0 lead for the third time. Burnley could have regained the lead when a Jason Shackell header was cleared off the line from Lescott with nine minutes left. Berahino was denied from close range by Burnley ‘keeper Tom Heaton at the other end but on the balance of play it was two points dropped for Burnley, one gained for the Baggies.

"report": "Peter Crouch's 90th-minute equaliser denied John Carver a first home victory as Stoke held Newcastle to a 1-1 draw at St James' Park. A tight affair on Tyneside appeared to have turned in favour of the hosts when Jack Colback struck in the 74th minute, just three minutes after he avoided a second bookable offence for a late challenge on Victor Moses, but Crouch’s header at the death salvaged a point for the visitors. Chances were few and far between in the first half as both sides struggled to create clear chances in front of goal, but efforts from Remy Cabella, Moussa Sissoko and Mame Biram Diouf could have broken the deadlock had each side’s goalkeeper not been up to the task. Stoke felt aggrieved Colback had been allowed to continue following his challenge on Moses, but Crouch ensured the trip back to the Potteries would be a good one after Ayoze Perez and Gabriel Obertan spurned glorious opportunities late on to secure the three points for Newcastle. Crouch: Equaliser was more than deserved Crouch: Equaliser was more than deserved Newcastle miss the chance to leapfrog their opponents in the table as both sides remain 10th and 11th respectively. With Stoke captain Ryan Shawcross and the influential Bojan missing through injury, Newcastle’s unchanged side had the better chances in an uneventful first half. The first opportunity fell to the hosts after 10 minutes as Sissoko found compatriot Cabella in the area but despite evading Marc Wilson, the Frenchman’s glancing header drew a fine reflex save from Asmir Begovic. Having initiated a counter-attack from his own half Sissoko found Cabella midway through the half, but the latter’s return pass was over-hit and allowed Begovic to smother the chance. Carver rues late goal Carver rues late goal Begovic was helpless towards the end of the half as Cabella lost Wilson and laid the ball into the path of Perez, who fashioned a yard and shot inches wide of the target. Stoke’s first clear-cut chance came on the brink of half-time. Steven Ireland was played onside by Vurnon Anita and his cross found Diouf who headed on target but not past Tim Krul, who produced his first save of the game. Colback, who picked up a yellow card for a late challenge on Marc Muniesa at the start of the second half, could count himself fortunate to have not received a second yellow for a scathing challenge on Moses. Within minutes he had made the most of his reprieve, rounding off a well-worked Newcastle attack by slicing a left-footed effort through the legs of Philipp Wollschied and in off the post. Hughes: Colback should have been sent off Hughes: Colback should have been sent off Ireland thought he had levelled the game, but his effort was ruled offside moments before he was replaced by Crouch. Obertan was hesitant as he wasted a great chance to extend his side’s lead and Perez’s over-exuberance to hit a thunderous strike saw his effort miss the target. These misses proved costly as Crouch rose to meet fellow substitute Geoff Cameron’s cross to level it at the death, prompting home boos from a crowd of just 47,763 - the lowest at St James' this season.

Jamie Carragher and Dwight Yorke debate whether the strikers or the system are to blame for Manchester United's lack of attacking prowess. Luke Shaw was sent off after the equaliser for a second bookable offence, but the result means Louis van Gaal’s side have lost just once in 17 games in all competitions. Manchester United had not lost away from home since a 1-0 defeat by neighbours Manchester City in early November, while West Ham had lost just once at Upton Park since August. David de Gea was forced into action by Enner Valencia twice in quick succession, first parrying a 25-yard drive out for a corner, and then denying the Ecuadorian from close-range with an acrobatic save. Blind's post-match reaction Blind's post-match reaction When James Tomkins lost Phil Jones at the far post from another cross, De Gea had to save well with his feet from the defender’s free header from eight yards. West Ham took the lead four minutes into the second half after a fine piece of skill from Kouyate. The Senegal international brought the ball down from a free-kick, turned with another fine touch and fired into the net. Manchester United then decided to up the ante, and Radamel Falcao had a fine chance to equalise in the 78th minute, but he could not lift the ball over Adrian after being put through on goal by Robin van Persie. LvG hails United spirit LvG hails United spirit Van Persie himself broke through minutes later, but his powerful low drive was blocked well by Adrian as Van Gaal’s side pushed for an equaliser. At the other end, West Ham should have had the points wrapped up late on only to be denied by the impressive De Gea again from Mark Noble’s close-range drive. Van Gaal introduced Marouane Fellaini with just under 20 minutes remaining, and the Belgian immediately caused problems for West Ham. Noble: Draw feels like a loss Noble: Draw feels like a loss First, his shot on the turn was saved turned wide well by Adrian, and then the midfielder was involved in the equaliser. After Fellaini headed the ball down Marcos Rojo’s long delivery into the box, Blind finished on the volley from 18 yards with his left foot into the corner through a crowded penalty area. Shaw was deservedly sent off after the equaliser for bringing down Stewart Downing, his second bookable defence.

Mesut Ozil’s third goal in as many matches gave the Gunners an 11th-minute lead but Tottenham’s pressure paid off when Kane fired home a 56th-minute equaliser for his first goal in a north London derby. The striker, under the watchful eye of England manager Roy Hodgson, then sealed victory for his boyhood club four minutes from time with a looping header into the far corner.

Harry Kane inspired Tottenham to victory in the north London derby as they came from a goal down to beat Arsenal. Harry Kane inspired Tottenham to victory in the north London derby as they came from a goal down to beat Arsenal. The hosts had started strongly, having plenty of possession and coming close when Kane’s curling right-footed effort was tipped around the post by David Ospina at full stretch. But Arsenal broke the deadlock when Danny Welbeck burst past Danny Rose on the right to pull the ball back to Olivier Giroud, whose mis-hit shot fell for Ozil to smartly volley home from inside the area. Ospina was called into action again to tip away Rose’s low strike towards the bottom corner, with the full-back dragging a similar effort inches wide of the post soon after. The Gunners 'keeper needed to be alert to push Ryan Mason’s powerful strike away, while Nabil Bentaleb and Kane both saw efforts go wide of the post. Spurs continued to dominate possession in the second half and eventually found a deserved equaliser when Ospina could only parry a flick-on from Christian Eriksen’s corner, Kane quickest to react at the far post to slide the ball home. The hosts were on top, with Moussa Dembele and Bentaleb both having low strikes parried away by Ospina. At the other end, Welbeck saw a bending effort tipped away from Hugo Lloris, with Laurent Koscielny heading straight at the Spurs 'keeper when unmarked at the resulting corner. But with the game heading for a draw, Kane planted a looping header from Bentaleb’s deep cross into the far corner for his 14th Premier League goal of the season, Spurs' third league win in a row their most satisfying.

stunning winner as Chelsea battled to a 2-1 win at Aston Villa to extend their lead at the top. Eden Hazard slotted home a sweeping early move from the visitors before Jores Okore headed in shortly after half-time to score Aston Villa’s first Premier League goal in nearly 11 hours, but Ivanovic’s thunderbolt sealed the points for the visitors. Eden Hazard: Netted Chelsea's opener Oscar had been denied by Brad Guzan while Willian went close with two low efforts in a scrappy affair, but Ivanovic’s goal was enough for Jose Mourinho pick up his first win at Villa Park in six attempts. Chelsea, who have now gone four games unbeaten, move seven points clear at the top of the table after Manchester City were held by Hull. The visitors dominated the early possession and were in front after eight minutes when Oscar moved down the line and found Willian, who slid an excellent pass into the box for Hazard to stroke across goal and into the far corner. Ivanovic scored the winner for Chelsea Ivanovic scored the winner for Chelsea Villa improved after that and started to see more of the ball. Fabian Delph looked to play an instrumental role and set up a good chance for Agbonlahor, who could only head the midfielder’s cross off target. Chelsea had a good chance to double their lead soon after as Ramires caught out Tom Cleverley before Nemanja Matic found Oscar with a good through ball and the Brazilian’s near-post effort was superbly turned away by Brad Guzan. Mourinho’s men allowed the visitors more possession in what turned into a scrappy affair, but they had another excellent chance as Hazard spotted the run of Ramires, who collected his pass and moved into the box only to be denied by a stunning last-ditch challenge from Ciaran Clark. Jose Mourinho couldn't speak highly enough about Branislav Ivanovic Jose Mourinho couldn't speak highly enough about Branislav Ivanovic Drought ended But Villa raced out of the blocks after the break and, after Andi Weimann’s volley and Tom Cleverley’s deflected shot both missed the target, the hosts’ goal drought was finally broken three minutes into the second half. The hugely impressive Carles Gil showed some good footwork to give himself some space to cross from the right, and Okore rose unmarked at the far post to nod it past Courtois for Villa’s first Premier League goal in nearly 11 hours. Paul Lambert had mixed emotions from an improved Aston Villa side Paul Lambert had mixed emotions from an improved Aston Villa side The visitors were rattled but soon found their composure, and Willian almost put Chelsea back in front, firing two efforts just wide of Guzan’s post from distance. But Mourinho’s men retook the lead on 66 minutes as Cesar Azpilicueta raced down the left and charged into the box. His low cross was blocked by Okore but he managed to play it to the far side of the area, where Ivanovic met it with a superb left-footed volley which flew into the top corner. The Blues have shown some excellent game-management skills in the past and Mourinho used them to full effect once again, introducing John Obi Mikel to the fray as Chelsea saw the remainder of the game out with little incident to move seven points clear and tighten their grip on the Premier League title. Phil Thompson’s verdict Phil Thompson gives his thoughts on Chelsea's 2-1 win over Aston Villa Phil Thompson gives his thoughts on Chelsea's 2-1 win over Aston Villa “Chelsea played the better stuff – they always looked in control but it wasn’t them at their sharpest. It was not a great day at the office, but they do enough. He knows how to win games, Jose Mourinho. “Villa did OK. They gave themselves a good chance in this game but it just wasn’t good enough.

After their fifth win in six under Pardew, the Eagles remain in 13th, but Leicester have lost three in a row, and remain rooted to the bottom of the table. The Foxes showed signs of the strain throughout the contest, with boss Nigel Pearson involved in a touchline fracas with Palace midfielder James McArthur. Riyad Mahrez: Tackles Dwight Gayle at King Power Stadium Palace started the match on the front foot, and, through Wilfried Zaha, looked a real danger on the counter. But for all their probing, Palace looked a little vulnerable at the back, and were fortunate not to concede. Julian Speroni got down to a Riyad Mahrez drive to push the ball out, with David Nugent unable to capitalise on the rebound. Nugent then had the chance of the first-half, but his header from a dangerous corner came back off the post, with Speroni well beaten this time. Nigel Pearson: Leicester need take more chances if they are to improve their form Nigel Pearson: Leicester need take more chances if they are to improve their form The introduction of Yaya Sanogo at half-time by Pardew gave the visitors added impetus and it was not long before they were in front. A left-wing corner picked out another Palace substitute, Brede Hangeland, at the back post, and his header back into the six-yard box was nodded past a stranded Mark Schwarzer by Ledley, on the run Almost immediately Ledley could have turned from hero to villain, as his woeful backpass was seized upon by Nugent, but the former Everton forward wasted the chance.

McArthur’s exchanged words with Pearson, the Leicester boss taking hold of the Palace player's shirt, but that flashpoint was quickly diffused by referee Lee Mason.

David Meyler had put Hull on course for a shock win when he pounced in the 34th minute but Milner's superb last-gasp strike snatched a point for the champions. Chelsea's 2-1 win at Aston Villa means City are now seven points behind the Premier League leaders, though, and Manuel Pellegrini's side have now not won for five successive matches in all competitions. Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini says his team must improve after they were held to a draw against Hull. Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini says his team must improve after they were held to a draw against Hull. While Milner's late equaliser left the Hull players disappointed at the final whistle, it is the champions who should be more frustrated by the result and another below-par performance. In the first half they were particularly lacklustre and even though they showed greater urgency after the break they only once tested Allan McGregor. The return of Yaya Toure from the Africa Cup of Nations cannot come quickly enough as they have now played six matches without him this season and not won any of them. Steve Bruce was delighted to see his Hull side emerge from the Etihad Stadium with a share of the points Steve Bruce was delighted to see his Hull side emerge from the Etihad Stadium with a share of the points Hull were hardly in form themselves ahead of the match but they looked the more composed and comfortable side in the early stages and Joe Hart was the first keeper to be tested by a low shot from Sone Aluko. The visitors should have gone ahead after 15 minutes as Ahmed Elmohamady headed Robbie Brady’s cross against the bar from close range. City continued to struggle creating chances but they also looked unconvincing at the back and poor defending led to the opening goal. Hart came out to clear when Martin Demichelis hesitated but could only find Jake Livermore, and when Pablo Zabaleta had another chance to swipe to safety, Gaston Ramirez nipped in and fired a shot against the post, Meyler reacting quickest to tuck home the rebound. James Milner says Manchester City's draw at home to Hull City is not good enough. James Milner says Manchester City's draw at home to Hull City is not good enough. It might have got worse for City before the break as they failed to clear a Tom Huddlestone free-kick and the ball fell invitingly for Aluko, but he blazed over. The introduction of Jesus Navas at the break helped the hosts raise their game and they finally tested McGregor with a snap-shot from Edin Dzeko. David Silva then had strong claims for a penalty turned down when he appeared to be pushed in the back by Alex Bruce. City continued to dominate possession but it looked like it might be Hull’s day when Aguero brilliantly controlled a cross with 89 minutes on the clock, only for his shot to rebound off the bar. But Milner bent a superb free-kick around the wall in injury-time after Aguero was fouled to salvage a point for the champions, who face another uphill task to make-up a deficit in the title race.

Soccer Saturday reaction - Tony Cottee \"Manchester City started sloppily and I don't think they were at it for whatever reason; the pace wasn't there. I wouldn't say there was a lack of effort, they just weren't on their game. \"When you're playing at home to a team like Hull, you've got to take the game to them and City didn't. They started with a defensive midfielder and playing of tippy-tappy football. When Fernando went off at half-time and Navas came on things improved. \"No team is going to go throughout the season playing their best but they can't keep dropping ponts. It's going to be difficult to make that ground up. They need to start better and create more. Yaya Toure coming back will be a big boost.\" Player ratings Manchester City: Hart (6), Clichy (6), Kompany (5), Demichelis (5), Zabaleta (6), Fernando (5), Fernandinho (5), Nasri (5), Silva (5), Aguero (6), Dzeko (5).

League: Swansea hit back to draw 1-1 with Sunderland at the Liberty Stadium Ki Sung-Yueng cancelled out Jermain Defoe's effort as Swansea and Sunderland shared the spoils at the Liberty Stadium. Sunderland, who had lost their last two Premier League away matches, took the lead thanks to Defoe's regal finish in front of the watching Prince Albert of Monaco - his second top-flight goal since his move from MLS side Toronto FC. But Ki marked his return from the Asia Cup in Australia with a diving header against his former loan club midway through the second half and despite late pressure from the hosts, the Black Cats held out for a share of the spoils. Sunderland manager Gus Poyet highlights the importance of new signing Jermain Defoe after the striker scored again against Swansea. Sunderland manager Gus Poyet highlights the importance of new signing Jermain Defoe after the striker scored again against Swansea. The Wearsiders settled well, even if Bafetimbi Gomis had the first shot of the contest, a 25-yarder that just flew wide of Costel Pantilimon's goal. Anthony Reveillere cut in between Neil Taylor and Nathan Dyer and crossed for former Swansea favourite Jordi Gomez to drive wide. Swansea slowly got their passing game together but Jonjo Shelvey and Dyer both failed to hit the target under pressure before the Sunderland defence was opened up by the slickest attack of the half. Taylor and Dyer were both heavily involved before Shelvey played the ball into the danger area. Modou Barrow could not collect but the ball ran free to Gomis and he was denied by a brave stop from Pantilimon, who threw himself at the feet of the Frenchman. Swansea thought they had taken a lead four minutes before half-time when Shelvey swung in a free-kick and Ki slotted home, but it was ruled out by a flagging assistant with television replays showing that it was incredibly tight. Swansea seemed to be still thinking about that close call when Sunderland broke moments later as Liam Bridcutt found Defoe just inside enemy territory. Swansea manager Gary Monk says he's pleased with how his team responded after going a goal down against Sunderland. Swansea manager Gary Monk says he's pleased with how his team responded after going a goal down against Sunderland. Defoe was allowed to advance and after giving Federico Fernandez the slip, he unleashed a 20-yard shot past the helpless Lukasz Fabianski three minutes before the break - his second goal in as many league games. It was poor defending from Swansea's perspective but further evidence that former England striker Defoe - also on target against Burnley still possesses the touch of a master marksman. The goal was another landmark for the England striker as it meant he had scored against all 20 teams presently in the Premier League. Sunderland claimed a penalty at the start of the second half when Ricky Alavarez tumbled over Ashley Williams' outstretched leg but referee Phil Dowd was not interested, and Fernandez wasted a decent chance for Swansea when he lashed over a bouncing ball in a crowded penalty area. Sunderland's Jermain Defoe says he's feeling sharp and is pleased to have hit the ground running at his new club. Sunderland's Jermain Defoe says he's feeling sharp and is pleased to have hit the ground running at his new club. Swansea were probing but Williams had to react smartly to stop Danny Graham - starting his first game for Sunderland since May 2013 - profiting from Gomez's cross to the near post and that intervention proved crucial. Kyle Naughton sent in a superb cross from the right and Ki ensured he would not be denied a second time with a firm diving header on 66 minutes. Shelvey went close with a 25-yard free-kick and Pantilimon pushed away substitute Nelson Oliveira's late effort but but Sunderland held firm to collect a point they probably deserved. The Swans stay in the top 10 ahead of a trip to West Brom on Wednesday, while the Black Cats remain in 14th, four points above the drop zone, although they can look forward to a home game against beleaguered QPR in midweek.

Both sides started the game in typically frenetic fashion but it was the visitors who made the better of the first half chances as surprise starter Jordon Ibe rattled the frame of the goal before Philippe Coutinho and Raheem Sterling called Joel Robles into a string of saves. Romelu Lukaku and Steven Naismith combined well in and around the Liverpool area but struggled to create a clear sight of goal in the first half. Brendan Rodgers: The least Liverpool deserved against Everton was a point Brendan Rodgers: The least Liverpool deserved against Everton was a point Gerrard almost snatched the points with an acrobatic effort but found Naismith in his way. Brendan Rodgers' side pushed for the opener in the second half as Daniel Sturridge was introduced, but Robles, and some resolute defending from both sides, ensured the game would end goalless. Ross Barkley's inclusion late on opened the game up and he set up Seamus Coleman at the death to win it for the Toffees but Simon Mignolet produced a fine save as each side had to settle for a point. Liverpool remain seventh after the draw, four points adrift of the top four while Everton moved a point closer to the top half of the table, they remain 12th. Steven Gerrard and man-of-the-match Jordan Ibe react to the stalemate at Goodison Steven Gerrard and man-of-the-match Jordan Ibe react to the stalemate at Goodison A raucous atmosphere at Goodison was met by a tense and tactical opening, as both sides jostled for supremacy. Sterling was lively from the off and looked to exert his pace early on. However, having collected Coutinho’s through ball and drawn Robles off his line, should have done more than hit the side-netting after eight minutes. Gerrard called the Toffees keeper into action minutes later as his free kick was tipped out for a corner. Lucas Leiva went off injured on the quarter-hour mark but Liverpool were unfazed as Robles was called into action again, this time denying Jordon Ibe from a yard as he tried to tap home Sterling’s deflected effort. Jamie Redknapp and Jamie Carragher say James McCarthy is fundamental to Everton's plans Jamie Redknapp and Jamie Carragher say James McCarthy is fundamental to Everton's plans Everton responded midway through the half and could have broken the deadlock had Naismith read the flight of Coleman’s cross and got an effort away. The best opportunity of the half was created by the 19-year-old Ibe who, after collecting the ball inside the Everton half and running towards goal, unleashed a thunderous drive which rattled the frame of the goal. Everton rallied but couldn’t get a clear sight of the Liverpool goal and it was Robles who was called into action again as Coutinho looked to replicate his FA Cup goal against Bolton, but the keeper was pulled off another save. Roberto Martinez says Everton's 0-0 draw with Liverpool was a real battle of tactics Roberto Martinez says Everton's 0-0 draw with Liverpool was a real battle of tactics Daniel Sturridge was brought on five minutes after the break but Liverpool had a string of chances before he entered the fray. After Gareth Barry’s error, Coutinho rushed his pass and failed to find one of the four team-mates he had in support. He made no mistake in finding a team-mate moments later as he threaded the ball into Sterling, but his shot drew another save from Robles. And from the resulting corner Gerrard almost broke the deadlock in style with an acrobatic volley which was deflected wide of Naismith. Graeme Sharp and Jamie Redknapp discuss the game Graeme Sharp and Jamie Redknapp discuss the game Ibe continued to run Everton full-back Bryan Oviedo ragged down the right and Sturridge almost benefitted from his efforts, but the substitutes attempt was blocked in the goal mouth. Things came to a head ten minutes from time as Muhamed Besic’s challenge on Ibe sparked an altercation which lead to Jordan Henderson and Naismith being booked, along with the Bosnia international for his initial challenge. Barkley’s inclusion opened up the game in a frantic final few minutes but neither fellow substitute Rickie Lambert, Coleman nor Gerrard couldn’t capitalise on the nature of the game to give their sides the advantage.

Walcott glad to have Ozil back Walcott glad to have Ozil back But they couldn’t breach the Gunners' defence and have now gone over 10 hours in the league without finding the net, while Arsenal registered their third win in a row - the first time they have done so this season. Villa played a high line early on and were given a warning when Walcott raced in behind only to be tackled by Jores Okore, but their defence was split open again just a few minutes later. The ball was fired forward by Bellerin, and Ozil produced a stunning first-time volleyed flick off the side of his boot, playing it beyond the defence for Giroud to chase. The Frenchman eventually got it under control and dinked the ball past Brad Guzan to put the hosts in front inside eight minutes. Patient Gunners please Wenger Patient Gunners please Wenger The visitors’ tactics seemed to change as they started to enjoy more possession, but the Arsenal chances kept coming as Cazorla held off Carlos Sanchez before smashing a low effort against the upright.

As 10 hours since Aston Villa’s last Premier League goal passed, the visitors looked down and out and unlikely to get on the scoresheet. Arsenal rounded off a superb afternoon in stoppage time as Cazorla squared the ball to Bellerin, who caught the ball perfectly with the side of his foot to steer it in off the post from the edge of the box.

The match had appeared to be heading towards a goalless draw before the visitors’ midfielder unleashed a powerful 25-yard drive to earn his side just their third away win of the season. And to compound matters for Southampton, left-back Ryan Bertrand was then shown a straight red card by referee Michael Oliver in the final minute after a reckless late tackle on Swansea substitute Modou Barrow. Southampton manager Ronald Koeman will be bemoaning his side’s inability to turn their dominance into points but they remain in the fourth and final Champions League berth, albeit on goal difference following Arsenal's victory in the lunchtime kick-off. In the first half, though, there appeared only one winner as Swansea barely made it beyond the halfway line, with wave after wave of Southampton attacks on Lukasz Fabianski’s goal. However, despite their total dominance of possession in the first 45 minutes, Saints’ best chance came early on after fine approach play down their right flank from the ever-willing Nathaniel Clyne. Garry Monk says Swansea won the tactical battle and soaked up the Southampton pressure. Garry Monk says Swansea won the tactical battle and soaked up the Southampton pressure. But when the right back’s pull-back fell at the feet of the on-rushing James Ward-Prowse six yards out, Swansea keeper Fabianski was in the right place at the right time to repel the midfielder’s effort. Swansea, meanwhile, had to cope with the early loss of Dutch forward Marvin Emnes through injury, while lone striker Bafetimbi Gomis struggled throughout to hold the ball up and bring his team-mates into play. Ashley Williams says his team-mates' work-rate and concentration was key to their victory at Southampton Ashley Williams says his team-mates' work-rate and concentration was key to their victory at Southampton After the half-time interval, though, there was a slight change of momentum as the visitors slowly began to get a foothold in the contest and Shelvey came desperately close to making the breakthrough just before the hour-mark. Picking up possession midway in the Southampton half, the playmaker embarked on a mazy dribble that took him past a throng of opposition players only to see a low 20-yard drive beat Fraser Forster and rebound off the base of the post. Ronald Koeman felt luck deserted his side and smiled on Swansea at St Mary's Ronald Koeman felt luck deserted his side and smiled on Swansea at St Mary's However, the Saints failed to heed that warning and with just three minutes remaining Shelvey once again tried his luck from distance, although on this occasion with a different outcome as Forster failed to divert his long-range effort past the upright. Southampton did respond to that setback in the dying stages but second-half substitute Saido Mane was twice denied by Swansea captain Ashley Williams with desperate goal-line clearances. And the skipper’s last-gasp interventions ensured Garry Monk’s men became just the third visiting side this season to leave St Mary's with all three points.

with team-mates John Carver recorded his first win as Newcastle caretaker manager with a 3-0 victory away to Hull City on Saturday. Carver had taken just one Premier League point from his first four games in temporary charge but goals from Remy Cabella and Sammy Ameobi either side of half-time and a deflected Yoan Gouffran effort were more than enough for maximum points. Remy Cabella celebrates scoring the opener Hull created plenty of opportunities and had a goal rightly disallowed in the first half when Ahmed Elmohamady diverted a Gaston Ramírez free-kick into the net with his hand. The result means Hull have now gone four games without scoring and will end the weekend in the relegation zone. Hull started the game on the front foot and Tim Krul had to be alert early on to deny full-back Andrew Robertson, who fizzed in a shot from a tight angle. Sammy Ameobi fires home his team's second goal Curtis Davies was the next Hull defender to go close on 18 minutes as he somehow failed to capitalise on a superb cross Elmohamady. His header was tipped away by Krul and then scooped from under the nose of Nikica Jelavic by Mike Williamson. Cabella had looked Newcastle’s brightest spark going forward and he gave his side the lead on 40 minutes. Robertson squandered possession deep inside his own half, presenting the ball to the French attacker 30 yards from goal. He found space on the edge of the area and fired a powerful shot into the bottom corner – his first goal for the club. Hull thought they had levelled just before half-time through Elmohamady but the linesman correctly spotted that the defender had used his hand to steer Ramirez’s pin-point cross into the net. Elmohamady was rightly booked. Vurnon Anita is closed down by Jake Livermore The visitors came out in the second half full of purpose and doubled their lead just three minutes after the break. Ameobi was the man who delivered the goods, taking full advantage of a sloppy Ramirez pass and thumping an effort from 30 yards past poorly-positioned Hull ‘keeper Alan McGregor. Fabricio Coloccini nearly handed Hull a path back into the game on 53 minutes as he sliced a clearance high into the sky and towards his own goal with Krul stranded. Thankfully for Newcastle, Vurnon Anita was alert and saved his skipper with a goal-line clearance. Ahmed Elmohamady of Hull City punches the ball into the Newcastle net Hull went close again 10 minutes later when good play between Robertson and Ramirez on the left presented Jelavic with a chance six yards from goal but the striker got his feet in a muddle and the chance was lost. All these missed chances seemed to take their toll on Hull’s confidence and Newcastle took full advantage, sewing the game up on 77 minutes through substitute Gouffran. The midfielder was awarded far too much space on the edge of the area and he struck a fine shot beyond McGregor via the aid of a deflection to seal the victory.

Sturridge scored on his return as Liverpool registered a 2-0 win over West Ham to leapfrog their opponents in the table. Brendan Rodgers praised his players after they beat a well-organised West Ham team Brendan Rodgers praised his players after they beat a well-organised West Ham team Raheem Sterling fired low past Hammers goalkeeper Adrian to put the hosts in front shortly after the break, before Sturridge’s powerful finish doubled the lead 10 minutes into his return from the bench. Philippe Coutinho was earlier denied by Adrian while Lazar Markovic fired a golden opportunity wide, moments after the hosts felt they should have had a penalty for a foul on Sterling by Joey O’Brien. But it would not matter in the end as the two England internationals netted in the second half, and Brendan Rodgers’ men move above the Hammers into seventh in the Premier League. Sam Allardyce believes that a growing injury list cost his side a result against Liverpool Sam Allardyce believes that a growing injury list cost his side a result against Liverpool It was an open affair right from the off, with Andy Carroll causing plenty of problems in the air. The striker caught Emre Can with a flailing arm early on and that seemed to rattle the Liverpool man for the rest of the half. The hosts had the first real chance, though, as the lively Sterling cut in from the flank and laid off for Adam Lallana. The midfielder was quickly closed down but it fell for Markovic, who had one shot blocked before firing wide. Sterling and Coutinho were the main threats for the hosts, and they nearly set up an opening goal when they played a superb one-two as the former backheeled it beyond the defence, but the Brazilian’s tame effort was easily saved at the near post by Adrian. Reaction from Raheem Sterling and Daniel Sturridge Reaction from Raheem Sterling and Daniel Sturridge The hosts then felt they should have had a penalty right on half time as Sterling spun round O’Brien only to go down under the defender’s challenge. Nothing was given, but Liverpool almost took the lead immediately as Markovic cut out Stewart Downing’s loose pass, only to fire wide of the target with the goal at his mercy. Cool finish The hosts finally broke the deadlock shortly after half-time, though. Alberto Moreno’s ball was chested down by Sterling, the ball deflected off Winston Reid into the path of Coutinho, who chipped a lovely ball beyond the defence, and Sterling slotted it calmly under Adrian with a cool first-time finish. The visitors hardly created anything, but Enner Valencia spurned a chance as he drilled a low shot straight at Simon Mignolet from 18 yards, before Coutinho showed some lovely footwork at the other end, working some space on the edge of the box and firing low at Adrian. The biggest cheer of the afternoon came with just over 20 minutes remaining, as Sturridge was finally re-introduced to first-team action after five months out when he replaced Markovic. It only took 10 minutes for Sturridge to score on his return. Coutinho raced into the West Ham half and played a lovely ball into the striker, who took a superb touch before drilling a low shot in at the near post to cap an excellent afternoon for Liverpool. Soccer Saturday reaction - Matt Le Tissier Matt Le Tissier says Liverpool were very comfortable against West Ham Matt Le Tissier says Liverpool were very comfortable against West Ham \"It was pretty comfortable, it really was. West Ham certainly weren’t at their best today. Liverpool were probably not as good as they were in midweek but it was still plenty enough to beat this West Ham side, who didn’t really threaten them too much. I don’t remember Mignolet having to make too many saves. \"It was great for the Liverpool fans to see Daniel Sturridge to come back – that was the highlight of the day for everyone. He got himself a little bit of space in the box, made a lovely first touch, got it on to his right foot and it was a brilliant finish in at the near post. I think that was the big plus point of the day, to see him, after such a long time, come back and give himself a chance and get a goal within 10 minutes of coming on.\" Player Ratings Liverpool: Mignolet (6), Can (5), Skrtel (6), Sakho (7), Henderson (7), Lucas (6), Moreno (7), Markovic (6), Lallana (7), Coutinho (8), Sterling (9).

Robin van Persie opened the scoring midway through the first half, latching on to Daley Blind's chipped pass to fire past Mark Schwarzer. Daley Blind pleased with team performance Daley Blind pleased with team performance There was a suspicion of offside as the striker darted beyond the defence, but referee Martin Atkinson denied Leicester's appeals. Moments later it was 2-0 as Van Persie sparked a quick counter-attack. The Dutchman's pass released Angel Di Maria down the left and, despite Schwarzer saving the winger's low drive, Radamel Falcao was on hand to slide home the rebound for his fourth United goal. Louis van Gaal's side were bursting with confidence and a minute before half-time they made it 3-0. Wayne Rooney's whipped corner was flicked on by Blind and the unfortunate Wes Morgan diverted the ball into his own net for the second time this season. Van Gaal: Disciplined performance Van Gaal: Disciplined performance Leicester offered little threat in the first half but pulled a goal back with 10 minutes of the match remaining through defender Marcin Wasilewski. After the visitors' set-piece appeared to break down, second-half substitutes Esteban Cambiasso and Marc Albrighton combined down the right and the former Aston Villa winger crossed for Wasilewski to head past David de Gea. Pearson highlights 'offside' goal Pearson highlights 'offside' goal Albrighton volleyed a dipping drive narrowly over the bar a minute later before Di Maria raced up the other end and blasted his shot high above the Leicester goal. It was a difficult afternoon for new Leicester signing Andrej Kramaric on his full debut, with the striker losing the ball for Blind to find Van Persie in the build-up to United’s opening goal. The Croatia striker was replaced by David Nugent in the second half and the substitute tested De Gea from a tight angle after racing clear of the United defence. The hosts looked to extend their lead in the closing stages but James Wilson, who had been sent on for Falcao, saw his shot saved by Schwarzer before Blind scooped the ball into the goalkeeper’s hands from the resulting corner.

The Republic of Ireland international scored twice in 13 first-half minutes, before adding a third in injury time to leave Rangers rooted in the relegation zone. His first saw him beat Robert Green from the edge of the box with his left, before he doubled the home side’s lead with a long-range effort in the 34th minute. QPR gave hope to their travelling fans when Niko Kranjcar continued a healthy run against the Potters that has seen him score three goals in three games at the Britannia Stadium, his shot sneaking in at the near post after Asmir Begovic parried Charlie Austin’s shot. Hughes hails Walters hat-trick Hughes hails Walters hat-trick It looked like the visitors may get their first away point of the season as they had the majority of the second-half chances, until Walters headed home a minute into injury time to seal his hat-trick. All of Stoke’s good early work came down the left hand side as Victor Moses linked up well with new defender Philipp Wollschied, and after dominating the early possession it wasn’t long before they scored. Karl Henry took too much time on the ball and tried to chest it down but when it ran away from him, Stephen Ireland flicked it down and Walters was there to collect and knock it across Green from the left-hand side of the box. Jonathan Walters heads in Stoke City's third goal for a hat-trick against QPR It only took Walters 13 minutes to extend the Potters’ lead with his second. Ireland – who was back in the team after two months out with injury – played the ball across the front of the Rangers defence and the striker was there to put it past Green from outside the box. Niko Kranjcar continued his good run at the Britannia as he scored his third goal in three games when he halved the deficit in the 36th minute. Joey Barton ran into the box and squared for Austin who shot, and when Begovic parried his shot away, Kranjcar was there to convert and give the Harry Redknapp something to smile about. QPR seemed to emerge with more resolve in the second half as they attempted to salvage something from their 11th away trip of the season. Redknapp: QPR just couldn't score Redknapp: QPR just couldn't score Vargas looked like he was on his way to levelling the scores when he latched on to Leroy Fer’s free-kick and attempted an audacious volley, but Begovic was alert and pushed it over on the hour. Substitute Peter Crouch nearly scored against his former manager after the Potters found their way back into the game. The lively Ireland tried to smash the ball across the front of the box, but as Crouch stretched for it he sent it wide. As the game progressed, QPR’s confidence grew and they had the majority of the chances in the second half. Barton won a free kick, which he took himself and the shot bounced off the bar, in front of the goalkeeper and away from goal. Then a minute into injury-time, Walters headed past Green after Barton’s weak defensive header, sealing his first Premier League hat-trick. The result leaves Rangers in trouble, a point from safety, while Stoke – despite the absence of the injured Bojan – climb to ninth.

Jermain Defoe scored on his home Premier League debut for Sunderland to help the hosts beat Burnley 2-0 at the Stadium of Light. Sunderland, who had not won at home in the league for almost four months, made a positive start and deservedly took the lead when Connor Wickham headed home from Anthony Reveillere’s cross in the 20th minute. Defoe doubled the advantage 14 minutes later as Patrick van Aanholt crossed for him to finish from close range. Poyet praises Defoe Poyet praises Defoe Burnley improved after the break but were unable to get back into the match after surprisingly taking off top scorer Danny Ings with just an hour gone. Ings, who has been linked with a move away from Turf Moor in this transfer window, looked frustrated with the decision and could only watch from the dugout as his side slumped to defeat. While it was a frustrating afternoon for Ings and Burnley, it was a much-needed victory at home for Sunderland after they were booed off by some of their fans following their FA Cup draw with Fulham last weekend. Despite their poor recent home record, the Black Cats started with purpose as they pressed the visitors high up the pitch and allowed Burnley little time in possession. Dyche: Ings here to stay Dyche: Ings here to stay Still, the first real chance of the match fell the visitors' way in the 17th minute as Ashley Barnes headed wide from David Jones’ free-kick from the right. A few minutes later Sunderland took the lead when referee Lee Mason played a good advantage to allow Sebastian Larsson to thread a ball through for Reveillere, who crossed for Wickham to head home. It was no more than the Black Cats deserved and they doubled their advantage in the 35th minute as Van Aanholt set up Defoe to score his first goal for the club. The full-back looked to be right in line with the last man as he was played in by Jordi Gomez and made the most of the call as he put the ball into the six-yard box for Defoe to finish. Jones and Barnes both tried their luck from range for Burnley without testing Costel Pantilimon but Defoe should have put the game to bed early in the second half as he mis-hit a shot from a good position. Burnley enjoyed a greater share of the possession after the break but struggled to break down a solid Black Cats defence. Barnes spurned their best chance when he headed into the ground from close range while Dyche opted to take off Ings and George Boyd on the hour mark. Poyet also replaced Defoe and Wickham with 15 minutes to go but Sunderland saw the rest of the match out comfortably to secure victory. Soccer Saturday reaction - Charlie Nicholas \"I was surprised Ings was taken off, I was expecting Vokes to come on and partner him and see if they could get the old routine going again. I know Barnes has done really well but I just think maybe they could have got that partnership together and seen if they could get a little sparkle. Ings was having to do the majority of the hard graft and it might have taken that burden away from him. \"I thought there some signs of fatigue from Burnley. There was just 10% missing and at this level that means you are going to struggle.\" Player ratings Sunderland: Pantilimon (6), Reveillere (7), Vergini (6), O’Shea (6), Van Aanholt (7), Bridcutt (6), Gomez (6), Johnson (7), Larsson (6), Wickham (7), Defoe (7).

Set-piece specialist Christian Eriksen, whose double against Sheffield United led Spurs to the Capital One Cup final in midweek, opened the scoring with a free-kick on six minutes. Harry Kane then powered home a second 10 minutes later as Spurs struck twice in the opening quarter of an hour to stun Tony Pulis' side. Kane reacts to brace Kane reacts to brace The Baggies rallied and had several chances to haul themselves back into the game but efforts from James Morrison and Claudio Yacob drew fine saves from the inspired Hugo Lloris, while Craig Dawson, having beaten the keeper, saw his header cannon off the bar. Having ended a four-game wait for a goal with his first, Kane notched his second just after the hour, converting from the penalty spot for his 20th of the season after referee Kevin Friend adjudged Joleon Lescott to have handled Kyle Walker’s cross in the box. The third goal all-but secured victory for the visitors as Spurs afforded Albion a number of chances in the closing stages without completely relinquishing their grip on the game. The trip to The Hawthorns was Spurs’ ninth game in a congested January fixture list and, prior to the game, Mauricio Pochettino expressed his concerns over the fitness of his players. Pochettino: Spurs showing character Pochettino: Spurs showing character Seemingly buoyed from booking their place at Wembley, his side showed no sign of fatigue as they raced into an early lead. Outnumbering their opponents in midfield, Spurs dominated the opening exchanges and were soon a goal up as Eriksen curled a free-kick over the wall and out of the reach of Ben Foster. Ten minutes later, it was two as Kane rounded off a fine Spurs attack, collecting Mousa Dembele's ball, cutting inside Andre Wisdom and rifling home from just inside the area. Albion then began to grow into the game and had two chances in quick succession to reduce the deficit. Pulis: Poor start cost us Pulis: Poor start cost us Morrison created a shooting opportunity at the edge of the area and appeared to have found the top left-hand corner of Lloris’ goal, only for the Frenchman produce an exquisite save to deny the Scot. And the Spurs captain was at it again a minute later, palming Yacob's effort away from goal following a superb training ground set-piece which involved Morrison, Chris Brunt and Saido Berahino. Dawson's towering header rattled the frame of Tottenham’s goal before the break as Albion pushed for a lifeline which failed to materialise. Spurs started the second half as they had the first, racing out of the blocks as Eriksen’s turn outside the box and left-footed drive came close to making it three. However, the third was not far away as Kane struck from the spot after Lescott’s handball. Berahino and strike partner Victor Anichebe continued to test Lloris, as too did substitute Craig Gardner, but his effort woud not have counted after he was penalised for handball. Kane’s hopes of a hat-trick were dashed as Roberto Soldado replaced him with minutes remaining but the result was in hand for League Cup finalists. Spurs leapfrog north London rivals Arsenal, who they play next weekend, into fifth while the defeat for Albion, their first under Pulis, sees them drop a place to 15th. Soccer Saturday reaction - Phil Thompson Spurs were the better team and you can’t take anything away from them. They were absolutely out of the blocks. You’d think there’d be a few tired legs after midweek – nothing of the sort. Kane comes back in there, the link-up between Kane and Eriksen is just absolutely marvellous. This was a team at ease with itself in the first 20 minutes, and West Brom are thinking, ‘How do we get out of our own half?’” \"Should Kane be in the England squad?: “Absolutely. If he’s not in that squad… I think this guy is so close to a start it’s untrue. He doesn’t often give it away. It looks as though he’s falling into people, but he’s in complete control of it. If you’re a defender trying to get close to him, it’s extremely difficult. I would have him in, I’d give him a start, he deserves it. He scored his 20th goal of the season – he should be in.” Player ratings West Brom: Foster (6), Wisdom (5), McAuley (6), Dawson (6), Lescott (5), McManaman (6), Yacob (6), Morrison (7), brunt (6), Anichebe (7), Berahino (7).

Thierry Henry and Jamie Redknapp discuss whether there was an element of controversy in the build-up to David Silva's equaliser for Manchester City Thierry Henry and Jamie Redknapp discuss whether there was an element of controversy in the build-up to David Silva's equaliser for Manchester City Loic Remy put Chelsea ahead just before half-time from close range after an uneventful opening, but the visitors went into the break level after David Silva turned home Sergio Aguero’s effort. Chelsea great Frank Lampard made his first appearance back at his old club in the 77th minute, but could not alter the scoreline as both sides cancelled each other out in a nervy encounter. With Diego Costa suspended, French striker Remy started at Stamford Bridge with Didier Drogba on the bench. City had the first half-chance through Fernando, whose deflected cross-shot from the right evaded Aguero by a yard. Lampard: Title race not over Lampard: Title race not over James Milner, impressive in the first half, then stole the ball from Branislav Ivanovic near the penalty area and played in Aguero, but the Argentine’s effort from an angle was batted clear by Thibaut Courtois. Aguero had a fine chance to give City a deserved lead after half an hour – put through on goal by a long ball from defence – but his low effort to Courtois’ right dropped a yard wide. Chelsea broke the deadlock with a fine move after 41 minutes, Ivanovic finding Eden Hazard on the left of the penalty area with a lofted pass before the Belgian’s superb first-time centre was tapped in by Remy from four yards. Matic satisfied with draw Matic satisfied with draw But four minutes later City were level. Courtois failed to deal with Jesus Navas’ cross effectively, with the ball falling to Aguero on the edge of the area to volley towards goal before Silva stretched to turn the ball inside the post from close range. City started the second half brighter, and Courtois was forced into an acrobatic save to tip the ball over the bar from Fernandinho’s header into the ground. The remainder of the second period saw City probe, but without any clear-cut chances for either side. Pellegrini: One team wanted to win Pellegrini: One team wanted to win Milner lashed a shot wide of Courtois’ goal after being found by Navas, but City failed to cause too many problems in the Chelsea penalty area despite winning eight corners.

The result leaves Everton without a win eight games in all competitions, sitting in 12th place in the Premier League, a point above West Brom. Lescott: That was hard work Lescott: That was hard work Tony Pulis set out to contain the hosts throughout the first half, and succeeded in keeping opportunities to a minimum.

Premier League title hopes a big blow after a deserved 2-0 victory at the Etihad Stadium. Goals in either half from Santi Cazorla, who converted from the spot after Vincent Kompany’s foul on Nacho Monreal, and Olivier Giroud, who headed home 20 minutes after the break, inflicted City’s third defeat of the season. Cazorla made no mistake from the spot in the 24th minute; forcefully placing the ball high to Joe Hart’s left after Kompany collided with Monreal as he tried to latch onto Giroud’s one-two. Santi Cazorla and Aaron Ramsey said they defended as a team and showed another side to their game Santi Cazorla and Aaron Ramsey said they defended as a team and showed another side to their game City, who went into the match on a 12-game unbeaten run in the league, pushed for an equaliser in the first half but fell short as the Gunners produced a disciplined and resilient defensive display which the champions struggled to deal with. A frantic start to the second period saw City create a number of chances but it was the visitors who struck to secure the points. Man of the match Cazorla delivered a free kick into the box for Giroud, who, after capitalising on Fernando's lapse in concentration, nodded past Hart from six yards. The result sees the Gunners move up to fifth in the table, a point adrift of fourth-placed Manchester United, while City remain second, five points off leaders Chelsea. Manuel Pellegrini conceded his side lacked the creativity required to win the game Manuel Pellegrini conceded his side lacked the creativity required to win the game The focus before the game was on the return of Sergio Aguero and Kompany, who both came back from lengthy injury-induced spells on the touchline. But it was the man who has orchestrated City’s recent rise toward the top of the table, David Silva, who made an impact early on, dancing his way through the Arsenal defence in the opening exchanges. After weathering an early onslaught, the Gunners sat deep and afforded their opponents little space to develop attacks. Instead, City enjoyed a large amount of possession high inside their half which allowed Arsenal to counter. Alexis Sanchez raced towards the City goal in one attack moments before Giroud spurned a great chance to open the scoring on 18 minutes. Arsene Wenger was delighted with the organisation of his side Arsene Wenger was delighted with the organisation of his side Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain was fond on the right and whipped an enticing ball in the near-post area, where the Frenchman’s header appeared destined for the back of the net but was deflected out by Kompany. The deadlock was broken just five minutes later, however, as Kompany, who was making his first league appearance since December 13, was penalised for a clumsy challenge on Monreal. Arsenal broke with intent before the left-back played a one-two with Giroud. As it appeared the left-back had got in behind the City defence, Kompany stepped into his path and Mike Dean had no hesitation in pointing to the spot. Cazorla calmly slotted the ball into the back of the net, and the Gunners were well worth their lead as City struggled to create clear-cut opportunities to reduce the deficit. Thierry Henry and Graeme Souness praised the discipline Arsenal showed Thierry Henry and Graeme Souness praised the discipline Arsenal showed Jesus Navas broke on the stroke of half time but Francis Coquelin’s intervention to first tackle the Spaniard and then rise highest to head away the resulting corner typified the Arsenal performance. Manuel Pellegrini brought on Stevan Jovetic at half time to bolster his attacking options, and it appeared to pay off as the hosts saw an effort from Aguero well saved by David Ospina before the change in tactics drew Arsenal out from their deep defensive position. With the game open, Silva began to dictate things in the middle of the park, notably his pass to Navas for his cross across the face off goal which looked destined for the back of the net had Laurent Koscielny not got a toe on the ball. Frank Lampard was introduced on the hour but City failed to create clear openings and they were punished minutes later as Giroud exploited some poor marking from the home side. Thierry Henry and Graeme Souness praised the performance of Santi Cazorla in their win over Manchester City Thierry Henry and Graeme Souness praised the performance of Santi Cazorla in their win over Manchester City Cazorla added an assist to his earlier strike with a perfectly-weighted ball into the area, where Giroud was on hand to convert, unchallenged, past Hart from close range. As they had with the first goal, City rallied but couldn’t quite get back into the game as late efforts from Jovetic and substitute Edin Dzeko were blocked and missed the target. Arsenal had several chances to make it three in the closing stages but the result was in hand as City lost in the league for the first time since October.

Fabio Borini scored his first Premier League goal for the club in almost two years and Rickie Lambert added a second with just over 10 minutes remaining to secure Liverpool’s sixth win in their last eight games. Villa – who have now found the net just once in their last seven top flight matches - created several good chances to level but Simon Mignolet produced a fine stop to deny Christian Benteke. The result drew boos from the home crowd, but under-pressure Villa boss Paul Lambert will be encouraged by his side’s build-up play and the performance of impressive new signing Carles Gil, although, once again, the finishing touch was missing and they remain three points above the drop zone. Liverpool went into the game having won their last four away matches in all competitions and started brightly, forcing a corner inside the opening two minutes, which saw Philippe Coutinho volley Alberto Moreno’s cross wide at the back post. Brendan Rodgers was delighted with his side's resilience at Aston Villa Brendan Rodgers was delighted with his side's resilience at Aston Villa Nathan Baker headed Keiren Westwood’s free-kick off target moments later as Aston Villa looked to get a foothold in the contest, but Alan Hutton had to be alert to intercept Jordan Henderson’s attempted pass to the returning Raheem Sterling as Liverpool took charge of the contest. Moreno thought he’d put the visitors in front on 17 minutes, when he picked up the ball 25 yards out, charged forward and drilled in from the edge of the box, but the linesman's flag had already signalled him offside. Martin Skrtel headed Gabriel Agbonlahor’s whipped cross behind moments later, in a rare first-half Villa foray forward, but Liverpool were soon back on the attack, with Brad Guzan having to smother the ball at Sterling’s feet after a smart Moreno pass. Reward Paul Lambert felt his side did everything but score and were unlucky to have lost to Liverpool Paul Lambert felt his side did everything but score and were unlucky to have lost to Liverpool Brendan Rodgers’ side got their reward for their dominant start on 24 minutes when Lazar Markovic fed Henderson and the England international’s cross from the right side of the box found unmarked Borini, who stretched to turn the ball in at the back post. The goal was Borini’s second in the Premier League for Liverpool but owed much to slack marking from Jores Okore. Liverpool continued to push forward and Coutinho was unable to convert an impressive move, heading straight at Guzan, before Borini shot high and wide from just inside the box and Sterling blew a glorious chance, chipping into the ‘keeper’s arms when clean through on goal. Liverpool almost paid for that wastefulness when Carlos Sanchez’s swerving long-range drive nearly deceived Simon Mignolet, before the previously anonymous Tom Cleverley fired over from Westwood’s superb pass. Villa forced two corners in quick succession at the start of the second-half but Liverpool continued to provide the more incisive play and Baker had to slide in to deny Borini before Guzan came up with an excellent finger-tip save to push Skrtel’s header onto the post. Charlie Nicholas says the result perhaps flattered Liverpool but believes there can be no excuses for an Aston Villa side that once again failed to score Charlie Nicholas says the result perhaps flattered Liverpool but believes there can be no excuses for an Aston Villa side that once again failed to score Lambert brought on Gil - a £3.2m recruit from Valencia - on the hour mark and just moments later Villa had their best chance of the game, but Mignolet produced a superb stop to parry Benteke’s powerful, close-range shot. Class Gil then showed some class, stepping past his marker before just failing to latch on to a one-two with fellow sub Andreas Weimann, before Baker headed over from a corner, Skrtel slid in to deny Benteke and Baker then failed to connect in the box as Aston Villa pressed for a leveller. Villa were looking the most likely to score next and Benteke hooked Hutton’s high cross wide before heading Gil’s corner off target. However, Liverpool remained a threat on the break and Lucas Leiva forced Guzan into a fine stop with a drive from the edge of the box, before sub Lambert put the game beyond doubt. On 79 minutes Villa half-cleared a Liverpool corner but Fabian Delph only succeeded in picking out Sterling. The forward moved the ball on to Lambert and the striker fired a right-foot shot across Guzan into the far corner. Villa tried to find a response - Delph tested Mignolet from long range before Benteke was again off target - but Liverpool comfortably saw out the remainder of the match to take all three points. Soccer Saturday reaction - Charlie Nicholas It felt as if the so-called protest wasn’t much, the Holte End looked full to me, so that’s maybe a positive for them. That’s as well as I’ve seen Villa play in terms of going forward – in the first half there were two or three attempts but nothing clear cut. At half-time 1-0 was justified, Liverpool were a threat, and Sterling could have scored but for a poor, poor finish. The second half Villa started fantastically well, Benteke had a couple of chances. The lad Baker missed two absolute certainties. It maybe flatters Liverpool, the result. But for Villa it’s the same old story and I can’t cover that up for Paul Lambert or his players.

maintained their 100 per cent record under new boss Alan Pardew as they fought back from two goals down to defeat Burnley 3-2 at Turf Moor. The Clarets were 2-0 up inside 16 minutes thanks to goals from Ben Mee and Danny Ings before in-form Palace striker Dwight Gayle pulled one back. Jason Puncheon equalised just minutes into the second half and then Gayle struck late on for his 10th goal in all competitions this season to seal maximum points. The pair both scored in the come-from-behind 2-1 win over Tottenham seven days ago and repeated the feat as the Eagles overcame an even greater deficit in snowy Lancashire. Victory helped Palace climb three spots into 12th position while Burnley remain just a point above the drop zone. Dwight Gayle scored twice to help Crystal Palace come from 2-0 down to beat Burnley at Turf Moor Dwight Gayle scored twice to help Crystal Palace come from 2-0 down to beat Burnley at Turf Moor Sean Dyche's men have not won back-to-back home league games since April, when they were in the Championship, and defeat ended a three-match unbeaten spell in the league. Tennis season seemed a long way off in snowy Lancashire, but two disputed line calls were involved in Burnley, who extended their own Premier League record by naming an unchanged side for the eighth consecutive match, taking a 2-0 lead. Kieran Trippier's corner may have been taken from outside the quadrant, but that would not have contributed to Joe Ledley's inability to mark Mee, who lost his man to head home at the far post from barely a yard out. The second was more hotly contested as Joel Ward tried to shepherd Mee's clearance into touch only for Scott Arfield to muscle the full-back out of the way, keep the ball in play – despite Palace protestations – and slide a pass inside for Ings to charge through the middle and slot past Julian Speroni. Sean Dyche says his side will learn a lot of lessons from their defeat to Crystal Palace Sean Dyche says his side will learn a lot of lessons from their defeat to Crystal Palace Pardew's decision to swap over his wingers paid off when Wilfried Zaha's pace helped him beat two markers and, although James McArthur's effort was blocked by the seemingly omnipresent Mee, the rebound was drilled home by Gayle. It was Palace's first away goal in 453 minutes, since Mile Jedinak's effort at Swansea on November 29. Zaha was enjoying more success the right, but on-loan Arsenal striker Yaya Sanogo, despite holding up the ball well, was given few opportunities, with his best coming from the last action of the first half with a header hooked over by Arfield. Burnley's inactivity for Palace's equaliser three minutes after the interval was inexcusable, however. Puncheon picked up the ball just inside the opposition half, but was allowed to turn and run 25 yards unchallenged and he took full advantage to beat Tom Heaton with a low shot just inside the goalkeeper's right-hand post. Alan Pardew hailed his side's comeback against Burnley Alan Pardew hailed his side's comeback against Burnley The momentum was all with the visitors now and, although Michael Keane's volley was cleared off the line by McArthur, substitute Glenn Murray hit a post before Heaton was beaten by Gayle's angled shot late on.

After a lacklustre opening 45 minutes in the Midlands, the game was settled by the Spaniard’s strike after 63 minutes – his fourth goal since signing for the Potters. Bojan's one-touch to control with his right before swivelling and finishing with his left was the game's real moment of quality. Leicester had the better of the chances in an uneventful first period but efforts from Anthony Knockaert and Jamie Vardy drew Stoke keeper Asmir Begovic into comfortable saves and never really threatened to open the scoring. Bojan Krkic and translator Marc Muniesa give their thoughts after the former's goal gave Stoke victory at Leicester Bojan Krkic and translator Marc Muniesa give their thoughts after the former's goal gave Stoke victory at Leicester New Stoke defender, loanee Philipp Wollschied, squandered a decent chance to break the deadlock for the visitors but it was Bojan who ultimately settled the contest. After going a goal behind, Nigel Pearson introduced Leicester’s new signing Andrej Kramaric into the fray but his involvement, along with that of substitutes Leonardo Ulloa and Tom Lawrence, did little to alter proceedings. The result sees the Foxes surrender their four-game unbeaten run in all competitions and remain rooted to the foot of the table, while Stoke leapfrog Newcastle, momentarily, into the top half of the table. Stoke captain Ryan Shawcross was forced to miss the game after he failed a late fitness test before kick-off. But, to the visitors’ credit, Leicester didn’t take advantage of his absence as it was the away side who started the game stronger, controlling almost 90 per cent of the ball in the opening five minutes of the game. Mark Hughes gives his thoughts after his Stoke side beat Leicester with a brilliant Bojan Krkic goal Mark Hughes gives his thoughts after his Stoke side beat Leicester with a brilliant Bojan Krkic goal Potters duo Bojan and Victor Moses, who returned to the first team for the first time in eight weeks, tried to initiate a number of attacks for the visitors but they came up against a resolute and well-drilled Leicester back four. The Foxes took a while to get going but the game’s first chance fell to the hosts just before the half-hour mark. After Paul Konchesky and Andy King had found each other just inside the Stoke half, the midfielder found Jeff Schlupp down the left channel. The Ghana international picked out Anthony Knockaert, who was late entering the area, but the Frenchman’s resulting shot was straight at Begovic which allowed him to collect with relative ease. The chance appeared to buoy Leicester and David Nugent tried his luck from a similar position to which he struck the bar against Aston Villa last weekend. This time, after collecting Vardy’s pass, Nugent opted to curl a shot toward the far corner of the Stoke goal, a decision which would have paid off had the shot been a yard lower. Leicester manager Nigel Pearson was left frustrated after his side's home defeat to Stoke Leicester manager Nigel Pearson was left frustrated after his side's home defeat to Stoke Stoke then had a great chance to open the scoring when Wollschied rose highest to meet Moses’ corner on 37 minutes. The German appeared to do everything other than connect well with the ball and fired a tame effort wide of the target, although Drinkwater was on the post to prevent it going in. Leicester had the last chance of the first half. Schlupp was involved again, collecting Drinkwater’s pass before finding his strike partner Jamie Vardy who escaped the clutches of Wollschied before producing an eye-catching back-heeled flick towards goal which Begovic collected comfortably. Stoke started the second half in similar fashion to which they had the first and created the first opportunity as Moses tormented several Leicester defenders before threading an inch-perfect pass into the path of Marco Arnautovic. Ben Hamer made some good saves but was unable to prevent Leicester from losing at home to Stoke Ben Hamer made some good saves but was unable to prevent Leicester from losing at home to Stoke The Austrian collected the ball in the right-hand channel of the box and, instead of shooting across goal, opted for a near-post finish which nestled into the side netting. Neither side seemed able to dominate the game until Bojan intervened just after the hour mark. Walters collected the ball on the right wing, fed it into the former Barcelona player’s feet and watched as he first stopped the ball with one foot and finished with the other inside Hamer's left-hand corner. Leicester were stunned and tried to push for an equaliser as Kramaric came on the reduce the deficit. Despite his bright and industrious performance neither he, nor his teammates, came closer than Knockaert’s deflected effort in the closing stages. Soccer Saturday analysis - Paul Merson Paul Merson says Nigel Pearson will be left in disbelief at his Leicester side's poor performance after a recent upturn in results Paul Merson says Nigel Pearson will be left in disbelief at his Leicester side's poor performance after a recent upturn in results Nigel Pearson must be sitting in his office with his staff and scratching his head. They’re bottom of the league but have had good results, but they never got going. Even Stoke will be getting back on the coach thinking ‘that was easy’. Leicester looked tired, I don’t know if they were nervous because it was a game they were expected to win – it’s harder to play than when you’ve got a free hit. I was shocked and disappointed at Leicester. The new lad came on, Kramaric, and he had good movement – very good movement. He looks a half-decent player and he should be for £9million. Bojan was different class. When he got the ball he looked like a special player, very special. That’s what all these other teams miss, that No 10. He would be perfect.

Van Gaal changed things at the break as he withdrew Mata in favour of Fellaini while Wilson replaced Jonny Evans, and the visitors looked far stronger in a changed system.

The Chelsea forwards both bagged a brace before the break and Andre Schurrle added a fifth in the closing stages as Jose Mourinho’s men extended their Premier League lead to five points, with second-placed Manchester City facing Arsenal on Sunday. Oscar described Chelsea's 5-0 win over Swansea as their best performance of the season Oscar described Chelsea's 5-0 win over Swansea as their best performance of the season It took 50 seconds for the away side to assert their authority, as Oscar picked up Gylfi Sigurdsson’s sloppy pass before driving toward goal and shooting into the bottom corner from 25 yards. Within moments the hosts could have been level when Sigurdsson almost made up for his previous error in spectacular fashion, but his 30-yard strike clattered against the angle of bar and post. That was Swansea’s best moment of the afternoon as Chelsea turned up the volume – Oscar shot at Lukasz Fabianski and Willian wasted the rebound in the 13th minute, but their profligacy wouldn’t last. Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho admitted he didn't expect his side to win so comfortably Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho admitted he didn't expect his side to win so comfortably After 20 minutes, a marauding passing move through the centre ended with Cesc Fabregas notching his 15th Premier League assist this season when Costa hammered home the second goal.

Swansea boss Garry Monk said his side made some 'horrible mistakes' against Chelsea and ultimately got what they deserved Swansea boss Garry Monk said his side made some 'horrible mistakes' against Chelsea and ultimately got what they deserved The Blues appeared to step up into different gears at the sight of their vulnerable opponents and Willian thundered a shot against the post with Swansea’s defence again bypassed. Swansea’s unrelenting philosophy of passing from the back haunted them again for Chelsea’s third – Federico Fernandez’s lazy back-pass gifted Costa a one-on-one opportunity and he netted his 17th of the league season. Just 76 seconds later, Chelsea robbed the ball back and Oscar delivered a curling shot from the edge of the box past Fabianski for the fourth goal. Costa still found time to miss a gilt-edged chance for a first-half hat-trick when he dribbled around the goalkeeper but found himself too wide to score. He teed up Willian, who hit the bar. Perhaps with an eye on Tuesday’s Capital One Cup semi-final against Liverpool, Chelsea softened their frenetic approach in the second period while maintaining a steely control of proceedings. Costa was denied a hat-trick as Mourinho withdrew him after 70 minutes but it was a substitute that added the fifth. After Eden Hazard and Branislav Ivanovic’s work on the right, Schurrle scored from point-blank range two minutes after his introduction. Soccer Saturday reaction - Alan McInally Alan McInally said Chelsea's football against Swansea was 'irresistible' Alan McInally said Chelsea's football against Swansea was 'irresistible' Chelsea’s passing in the final third was simply irresistible, it was accurate. They had a real confidence about them in the first 25 minutes. Of course when they got the first goal, albeit with a misplaced pass from Sigurdsson and Oscar takes it and drills it past Fabianski, you could genuinely hear the crowd say ‘uh oh, that’s a bit early to concede, in the first minute’. At 2-0 I thought they might take it easy but they kept on. Matic was different class, Fabregas was always a problem. They looked a really, really good outfit and Swansea were a yard shorter, a yard slower and muscled out of the game.

Fletcher had a good opportunity to level the game two minutes later as Jones sent a ball into the box, but he mis-kicked the ball and it went wide. The equaliser came after Vertonghen was penalised in the 29th minute for bringing down Defoe 25 yards from goal, after the striker ran past Eric Dier. Larsson stepped up and sent the free-kick over the wall and into the goal, with Hugo Lloris unable to reach it as it snuck inside his right-hand post. Harry Kane had a chance to restore Tottenham's lead on the stroke of half-time but his shot bounced off the post and Pantilimon saved the rebound shot from Danny Rose. Sunderland goalscorer Sebastian Larsson said his side should have gone on to win the game Sunderland goalscorer Sebastian Larsson said his side should have gone on to win the game Roberto Soldado should have scored shortly after the break but was unable to connect with Eriksen’s cross after the Denmark international played a one-two with Walker to find space just outside the box. Pantilimon saved from Eriksen, Kane and Chadli in quick succession to keep the visitors in the game as the hour mark approached, while top scorer Kane and Eriksen also sent efforts wide. The game appeared to be heading for a draw until the introduction of Townsend in the 75th minute whose fresh legs aided the home side’s attacking line. Defoe was replaced by Danny Graham at the same time, with Black Cats manager Gus Poyet having admitted prior to the game that the striker wasn't completely match fit. With just 10 minutes to go, Adam Johnson took a shot from 25 yards out that Lloris could only parry to Graham, who was unable to latch onto the rebound. It was Townsend’s cross that set up the winner. The substitute raced down the right-hand side and his cross to the edge of the box was perfect for Eriksen, whose shot bounced in off the post past a stranded Pantilimon. Graham had a chance to salvage a point for the Black Cats in the third minute of injury-time but Lloris got down quickly to push the ball wide. There was more drama to come as Vertonghen’s disallowed goal came seconds later, to end a frantic final 15 minutes that takes Spurs above Arsenal in the Premier League table as the hosts moved up one place to fifth. Sunderland remain in 16th spot, but they are only one point above the drop zone with the equal-third worst goal difference in the league of -14. Soccer Saturday analysis - Phil Thompson Phil Thompson says Sunderland defended superbly but Tottenham kept going and got the win they deserved Phil Thompson says Sunderland defended superbly but Tottenham kept going and got the win they deserved It was attack v defence for a lot of the time and Sunderland defended magnificently. But the way things go, you don’t get anything out of it. At 1-0 you think ‘at least Sunderland have got to come out’ but they just didn’t have enough quality to break them down. Harry Kane was playing in the No 10 role and was too far from goal, Soldado needed a little help in the box. I thought Defoe did alright for his first game and I must say he should have had a penalty, but it’s debatable. Vertonghen was done and he knows it.

Victory helped the Gunners gain revenge for their 3-2 defeat at the Britannia Stadium last month and send them above neighbours Tottenham into fifth position. Jamie Carragher and Glenn Hoddle discuss Alexis Sanchez's performance against Stoke. Jamie Carragher and Glenn Hoddle discuss Alexis Sanchez's performance against Stoke. Sanchez, signed for £30million in the summer from Barcelona, was the creator for Laurent Koscielny to hand the hosts an early lead before scoring himself just after the half hour mark. The Chile international added his second of the afternoon with a deflected free-kick for his 12th Premier League goal of the season and his 18th in all-competitions to hand Arsene Wenger's men their first top flight win of 2015. The victory, though, could have come at a cost as full-back Mathieu Debuchy, who had only just returned from an ankle problem, was carried off during the first half after suffering a shoulder injury when falling into the advertising hoardings after colliding with Stoke's Marko Arnautovic. Arsene Wenger says Arsenal's win over Stoke was marred by Mathieu Debuchy suffering a dislocated shoulder Arsene Wenger says Arsenal's win over Stoke was marred by Mathieu Debuchy suffering a dislocated shoulder Wojciech Szczesny, meanwhile, had been left to watch on from the bench as Colombian David Ospina made his Premier League debut, the Poland international having found himself the centre of some negative headlines earlier this week for smoking in the showers after the defeat at Southampton on New Year's Day. Arsenal had shown their intent from kick-off as Sanchez tested Stoke goalkeeper Asmir Begovic with an early effort which was curling towards the bottom right corner before being pushed behind. Stoke had not won at Arsenal since August 1981, and were trailing again after five minutes. Begovic pushed an angled drive from Tomas Rosicky behind. Sanchez's corner was only half-cleared, and Koscielny played the loose ball back out to the striker. Mark Hughes admitted his Stoke side fell well below the quality of their recent performances Mark Hughes admitted his Stoke side fell well below the quality of their recent performances Centre-back Koscielny ran off into the six-yard box and ghosted in unmarked to plant a firm header past Begovic after a peach of a cross from Sanchez. Arsenal were soon forced into a defensive change as Debuchy was sent tumbling behind the goal after colliding with Arnautovic. The France defender needed medical assistance and was eventually carried off on a stretcher, clutching his shoulder. Hector Bellerin came on in the 13th minute. Arsenal continued their offensive, with Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain shooting wide after being played in on the right by Sanchez. Laurent Koscielny says it was crucial that Arsenal started quickly against Stoke following the game at the Britannia Laurent Koscielny says it was crucial that Arsenal started quickly against Stoke following the game at the Britannia Olivier Giroud - who returned from a three-match suspension - was denied by a spectacular flying save from Begovic. Glenn Whelan fired over after a clever free-kick from Bojan Krkic on the right was pulled back to the edge of the Arsenal area, but it was 2-0 to Arsenal in the 33rd minute thanks to a goal of the highest order from Sanchez. A quick exchange with Rosicky put Sanchez in space on the right. He jumped the lunging challenge of Steven Nzonzi before darting into the penalty area, where he turned Stoke captain Ryan Shawcross inside-out before clipping the ball past Begovic inside the goalkeeper's near post. Jamie Carragher and Glenn Hoddle discuss Alexis Sanchez's performance against Stoke. Jamie Carragher and Glenn Hoddle discuss Alexis Sanchez's performance against Stoke. When play resumed, Nacho Monreal was caught in the face by a stray elbow from Stoke forward Peter Crouch and needed several minutes of treatment for a cut just above his eye. Stoke looked to regroup for the second half, with Nzonzi replaced by Steve Sidwell and Erik Pieters by Marc Muniesa. However, it was 3-0 and game over in the 49th minute. Sidwell tripped Oxlade-Chamberlain on the edge of the penalty area. Sanchez's low free-kick took a deflection off Geoff Cameron in the wall which deceived Begovic, who could only push the ball against the post before it squirmed over the line. Arsenal went close again when Santi Cazorla shaved the crossbar with an angled chip as the Gunners grew in confidence. Fit-again England forward Theo Walcott and then German playmaker Mesut Ozil, who had been out since October with a knee injury, were sent on for the closing stages and both men shot wide when played in on goal.

Premier League as substitute Dusan Tadic’s second-half goal gave Ronald Koeman’s side a 1-0 win at Old Trafford.

Dusan Tadic feels it was a beautiful day for Southampton Dusan Tadic feels it was a beautiful day for Southampton After Graziano Pelle had hit the post with 69 minutes gone, Tadic, who had only been introduced six minutes before, rolled the rebound home past Tyler Blackett for the game’s only goal. Juan Mata had two opportunities to bring United level late on, but the visitors held firm and now lead fourth-place United by two points.

The visitors had the first half-chance of the game, Nathaniel Clyne cutting through on the right having played a nice one-two with Pelle, but the Englishman’s low effort went wide of David de Gea’s goal. But Southampton were forced to make a change in their defence in the opening 20 minutes after Toby Alderweireld went down in agony having stretched to cut out Angel di Maria’s through ball, making way for Florin Gardos. Louis van Gaal felt that Southampton came looking for a draw Louis van Gaal felt that Southampton came looking for a draw The best chance of the half fell to Van Persie, whose shot, after being found inside the area by Wayne Rooney, was blocked by Gardos and collected by Fraser Forster. The second half looked like following the flow of the first, but it took Saints to score for the game to come to life. Tadic was brought on for debutant Eljero Elia, and immediately made an impact, offloading for Pelle to hit the post before converting the rebound past the outstretched leg of Blackett on the line from 15 yards.

Markovic is congratulated after scoring Liverpool's opening goal at the Stadium of Light Lazar Markovic bagged his first Premier League goal as Liverpool claimed a deserved 1-0 victory over 10-man Sunderland. The Serbia international netted from close range on nine minutes when Fabio Borini’s through pass deflected into his path as the Reds recorded their sixth win in nine visits to the Stadium of Light. Liverpool completely dominated the first half, with Markovic denied a penalty in the early exchanges, but they wasted a plethora of chances that would have put the game beyond their hosts. Sunderland were booed off at half-time after failing to muster a shot on goal and they were reduced to 10 men on 49 minutes when Liam Bridcutt picked up a second yellow card. The sending off spurred Sunderland momentarily, with Adam Johnson crashing a shot off the crossbar, but that was as good as it got as their dismal home form continued. Liverpool travelled to a blustery north east in good form and they completely dominated the first half. The visitors should have been awarded a penalty after just three minutes when Markovic hit the deck following a clumsy challenge by Wes Brown, but referee Craig Pawson waved away their appeals. But Markovic wouldn’t be denied and his regular runs up the right wing were rewarded when he fired Liverpool in front. The Serbian passed inside to Steven Gerrard and then carried on forward looking for a return ball. Fabio Borini was taken out by John O’Shea on the edge of the area but Pawson played advantage and Markovic bundled past Costel Pantilimon. The only negative from Liverpool’s first-half performance was that they didn’t extend their lead. Markovic hit the crossbar with a spectacular effort from the edge of area, while Gerrard twice forced Pantilimon into action and also smashed a shot narrowly wide. Liverpool should have doubled their lead on the stroke of half time when former Sunderland loanee Borini beat Brown to Emre Can’s through ball. The Italian rounded Pantilimon but fired into the side netting. Gus Poyet would have been glad to get his team into the dressing room but his half-time teamtalk went up in smoke on 49 minutes when Bridcutt picked up a second yellow card for a needless foul on Can. Despite their numerical disadvantage, Sunderland then enjoyed a spell of possession and Johnson went close to a stunning equaliser when his long-range shot cannoned back off Simon Mignolet’s crossbar. Liverpool continued to create chances, with Coutinho shooting narrowly wide and Pantilimon denying substitute Mario Balotelli from an acute angle, but their failure to register a second goal kept Sunderland in the game. Sunderland staged a last-gasp assault with Pantilimon going forward for a corner, but Liverpool clung on for a win that should have been much more convincing.

Harry Redknapp was disappointed with his side’s defending. Goals from Scott Arfield and Danny Ings sent Burnley to a 2-1 win over relegation rivals Queens Park Rangers at Turf Moor. Arfield gave the hosts the lead on 14 minutes with a fine individual effort but Charlie Austin’s penalty after he was fouled by Dean Marney levelled the scores on 33 minutes. But Ings showed his importance to the Burnley side by scoring what turned out to be the winner eight minutes before the break. Sean Dyche was delighted with his side’s performance. Sean Dyche was delighted with his side’s performance. Sean Dyche's men looked the more likely to score in the second period and cruised to victory as QPR, who drop into the bottom three, set a Premier League record of 10 successive defeats away from home at the start of a season. Burnley took advantage of a strong wind in the early stages and the pressure told within 14 minutes. There seemed little danger on the left flank when Arfield cut inside Mauricio Isla but the Burnley winger battled his way through a weak challenge from the on-loan Juventus man and next in his sights was Richard Dunne. The QPR defender was caught flat-footed by the winger, who shifted the ball onto his right foot and curled a shot into the bottom corner. Scott Arfield scores the opening goal . QPR almost hit back three minutes later but former Burnley striker Austin stabbed a shot from eight yards against the post after some nice play between Isla and Eduardo Vargas on the right flank. However, Austin did get his name of the scoresheet with 33 minutes played. Adel Taarabt, who was handed his first Premier League start for QPR since April 2013, linked the play in midfield well with Vargas, who in turn found Austin in the area. The striker beat one challenge before Marney left a lazy leg dangling and took down QPR’s top scorer in the area. Austin dusted himself down and despite a barrage of boos for the returning striker, he confidently hammered the ball from the penalty spot past Tom Heaton into the bottom corner. Harry Redknapp was disappointed with his side’s defending. Harry Redknapp was disappointed with his side’s defending. QPR had their best spell of the game after the goal and Vargas was denied by a flying save from Heaton after Joey Barton had found the winger with a fine long pass. The QPR momentum looked certain to bring more chances but a moment of brilliance from Ings and some lacklustre defending from the visitors put the hosts back in front. Ashley Barnes played a hopeful ball into the QPR area to Ings, who got to the ball ahead of Steven Caulker and showed great tenacity to hold him off. Ings still had Dunne to beat but did that majestically, shifting the ball to the left of the defender before firing a shot back across goal and into the far corner. Burnley's Danny Ings slots it past QPR's Robert Green to make it 2-1 From that moment QPR never looked capable of getting back into the match despite being just one goal behind. Barnes should have increased his team’s lead on 53 minutes but his shot from eight yards after a routine long throw wasn’t dealt with by Dunne and was palmed away by Green. All the action continued to come down Green’s end of the pitch and he had to be quick off his line on 60 minutes to deny Ings, who had been found by his strike partner inside the box. Ings went close again on 73 minutes but his touch let him down at a crucial moment when being played through on goal by Arfield. Harry Redknapp threw on Bobby Zamora and new signing Mauro Zárate in the closing stages but it only opened the game up for Burnley to create more chances. In the last 10 minutes, Michael Keane had a header saved from point blank range after a fine Kieran Trippier corner and Arfield was denied by a last gasp Isla tackle. With time running out QPR finally created some pressure and Heaton had to be alert to divert a Caulker header over the crossbar as Burnley held on for an important victory in the battle for survival.

They are carrying on the work they are doing and now they have Danny Ings available, Ashley Barnes in good form and Scott Arfield scored today. They had quite a few chances and scored two worldies. They have pressure and effort all the time. You talk about the science of football, but this is the same team – more or less – that has been playing right over the holiday period and they are still going! The effort, commitment and skill is still there. QPR had a go, but some of the defending was absolutely dreadful and that's why they are where they are.

Kurt Zouma: Delighted after beating Newcastle in his first Premier League start. Kurt Zouma: Delighted after beating Newcastle in his first Premier League start. But Chelsea slowly improved throughout the game to do enough to take victory and pick up their first Premier League win in three. Both sides made a host of changes. Petr Cech and Kurt Zouma kept their places for Chelsea, but John Terry returned to make his 648th appearance and move equal with Frank Lampard on the all-time list for the Blues. It was a nervy opening period from the hosts, who were wary of the need for a good result after going two without a win in the Premier League. Paul Merson: Newcastle's first half performance was outstanding. Paul Merson: Newcastle's first half performance was outstanding. Newcastle almost took advantage of Chelsea's nerves when Yoan Gouffran tested Cech with a rasping free kick which the goalkeeper managed to parry away. Cabella then saw a 20-yard volley blocked by Cesar Azpilicueta before Sissoko charged forward for the visitors, rifling a stunning effort against the corner of post and crossbar, much to Cech’s relief. But it was Chelsea who took the lead after Willian forced a corner off Coloccini. The Brazilian thought quickly to play it short to Ivanovic and, with the visitors still tracking back, the defender played it across for Oscar, who tapped in at the far post to score with the Blues’ first shot on target. It was a sucker punch for Newcastle, who had impressed and threatened throughout the first half, with Cabella causing the hosts all sorts of problems down the flank. The Magpies’ misery was nearly doubled after Mike Williamson brought down Diego Costa on the edge of the box. Willian stepped up and Krul did well to parry away the resulting free kick, which was bound for the top corner. Decisive blow Chelsea were much improved after the break and kept possession well as Newcastle’s challenge seemed to fade. Costa lead the line well for the hosts and sparked claims of handball as his cross from the left appeared to hit Coloccini’s arm, but the referee decided it was not enough to warrant a penalty. Chelsea Assistant Coach Steve Holland was impressed by his side's second half performance after a poor first 45 minutes in the victory over Newcastle. Chelsea Assistant Coach Steve Holland was impressed by his side's second half performance after a poor first 45 minutes in the victory over Newcastle. The decisive blow then came just before the hour mark as Costa worked hard to win the ball out on the left before he laid it back to Hazard. The Blues played some wonderful intricate passes before it was flicked into the area. Oscar played a backheel into the path of Costa, who worked some space before drilling low into the net. Costa nearly added a superb second goal as Fabregas won the ball off Colback and played it into the striker, who skipped past several challenges with some stunning skill before scuffing his shot, allowing Coloccini to slide in and deflect it over the bar. But it wouldn’t affect the overall result as Newcastle’s challenge had long since faded, and the hosts took a much-needed victory to keep their place at the top of the pile. Soccer Saturday analysis – Paul Merson Newcastle were outstanding in the first half. They attacked with flair and Chelsea couldn’t get going. Usually Chelsea have good protection at the back, but Newcastle were running into little pockets and Cabella was getting past John Terry. I haven’t seen players running at him like that for a long, long time. When you’re on top you need to score, but they didn’t. After Costa’s goal the game was over. Chelsea do know how to kill a game, there’s no doubt about that.

David Silva was at the heart of the champions’ best work and he must have thought he had helped his side to all three points when his deflected shot was headed home by Fernandinho to break the deadlock with just over 15 minutes remaining. Manuel Pellegrini was left to rue a host of missed chances in the first half for Manchester City. Manuel Pellegrini was left to rue a host of missed chances in the first half for Manchester City. But Roberto Martinez’s side roared back minutes later as Steven Naismith rose highest to head Leighton Baines’ brilliant free-kick past Joe Hart and into the bottom corner for a share of the spoils. Manchester City, who were without Yaya Toure due to his Africa Cup of Nations commitments, had not won an away match without the Ivory Coast midfielder since January 2013 and were looking to end that run on Merseyside. Pellegrini was looking for someone to fill the powerful Ivorian’s void at Goodison Park and Silva stepped into the mantle beautifully in the opening minutes, skipping past the tackle of Muhamed Besic before releasing Jesus Navas down the right, but the Spaniard’s cross was well blocked. Goalkeeper Joel Robles of Everton pounces on the ball under pressure from Samir Nasri. Silva was a constant menace to the home defence and he pounced on the ball after Seamus Coleman was robbed in the middle of the park and drove forward, releasing Stevan Jovetic into space but the striker dragged his shot wide. The Spaniard again picked up the ball following Phil Jagielka’s mistake and played Navas through on goal but the shot was pulled wide without testing Joel in the Everton goal. Everton manager Roberto Martinez praised his team's defending against Manchester City as they claimed a point. Everton manager Roberto Martinez praised his team's defending against Manchester City as they claimed a point. With the home crowd growing restless Everton suddenly burst into life as Romelu Lukaku went through on goal, but Hart, who was quiet for large parts of the first 45 minutes, produced an important save from the Belgian striker’s angled shot. Seconds later the ball found its way to the feet of Coleman and the full-back’s shot beat Hart all ends up but cannoned back off the crossbar. Martinez would have wanted more of the same after the break and they produced the first chance of the second half as Ross Barkley fired a free-kick over the wall but it failed to hit the target. Everton looked dangerous when they could get service to Lukaku and he caused Eliaquim Mangala plenty of problems as he tried to wrestle down the right touchline, but the French defender hauled him back and was shown a yellow card. Everton's Steven Naismith praises the team's work ethic against Manchester City. Everton's Steven Naismith praises the team's work ethic against Manchester City. Minutes later, Lukaku breezed past Mangala again but his left foot shot across goal was once again well saved by Hart. With City looking to keep pace with leaders Chelsea, Pellegrini sent on Sergio Aguero with just over 20 minutes left but it was Everton who thought they had taken the lead. Jagielka poked the ball into the back of the net from close range after Hart fumbled Baines testing free-kick, but referee Martin Atkinson decided Naismith had fouled the England goalkeeper. City were still frantically searching for a winner when the ball bounced into the path of Aguero on the edge of the box, but the Argentine, perhaps lacking sharpness after his injury lay-off, screwed his shot wide. But City persevered and they finally got their reward when Silva’s deflected shot fell into the path of Fernandinho and the Brazilian headed past Joel from close range to give his side the lead. Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart says his team made enough chances to win the Premier League game against Everton. Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart says his team made enough chances to win the Premier League game against Everton. Pellegrini could have been forgiven for thinking his side were home and dry but Everton had other ideas and they bounced straight back thanks to Naismith’s powerful header from Baines’ free-kick. The visitors introduced Frank Lampard late in the day but apart from a half-chance for Samir Nasri, Everton were not to be denied their much-deserved point, which takes them up to 12th in the table. City, who are now unbeaten in 12 Premier League matches, find themselves two points adrift of Chelsea at the top of the Premier League.

Charlie Nicholas was full of praise for David Silva’s performance against Everton, but says a draw was the fair result. I thought Man City and, in particular Silva, were a constant threat all day, but you expect that with the quality that the little genius has got. Everton reverted back to their old system with Barkley just behind Lukaku and it didn’t suit Barkley as much – but it suited Lukaku better and he had the pace to take on both centre-backs of Man City. The second half was great. With a strong wind blowing it was hard to get perfect passing and both teams tried their best. When Man City got the goal I thought the game would be over, but when Everton equalised it was end-to-end with both teams at full pelt trying to get three points. I thoroughly enjoyed it.

Konchesky’s strike on the cusp of half time gave the hosts a deserved lead at the break and proved to be the game’s pivotal moment as Villa went a fourth game without scoring a goal. Leicester manager Nigel Pearson was disappointed to see his side denied two penalties during the 1-0 win over Aston Villa. Leicester manager Nigel Pearson was disappointed to see his side denied two penalties during the 1-0 win over Aston Villa. The game was marred in the final stages as Matty James received a straight red for a challenge on Jores Okore. The tackle sparked a brawl which resulted in Ciaran Clark picking up a second booking and leaving the field as well. But Leicester extended their unbeaten run to four games in all competitions and moved to within touching distance of those around them at the bottom of the table. With Riyad Mahrez away at the Africa Cup of Nations, Nigel Pearson handed Marc Albrighton only his second start this season and the former Villa midfielder looked determined to make the most of his rare outing and prove a point to his former employers as Leicester started the game brighter than their opponents. Having tried to establish a connection with David Nugent in the opening exchanges, where only a combination of adverse weather conditions and last-ditch defending prevented two early openings, Albrighton then took the lead role in the game’s first chance of quality. After challenging Alan Hutton in the air, the winger raced into space down the left channel before rolling the ball across to Nugent to tap into an empty net. Nugent’s shot, though, skewed wide of the target and his touch inadvertently prevented the on-rushing Anthony Knockaert from finishing from an easier position. Paul Lambert says his side need to work harder in training after a 1-0 defeat to fellow strugglers Leicester. Paul Lambert says his side need to work harder in training after a 1-0 defeat to fellow strugglers Leicester. Christian Benteke proved to be the early out-ball for the visitors but the Belgian took his time to come to terms with the Foxes’ offside trap and saw an effort ruled out by the linesman after 20 minutes. Within minutes, though, Nugent had another chance to open scoring but, under pressure from Clark and Okore, his header missed the target. Villa responded with their best move of the game five minutes later as Benteke, Alan Hutton and Gabriel Agbonlahor combined to tee up Tom Cleverley on the edge of the box, but his shot was deflected by a combination of Marcin Wasilewski and Wes Morgan before it could draw Ben Hamer into action. As the interval approached, Leicester had strong claims for a penalty ignored. A corner evaded everyone in the box and Okore mis-controlled the ball and gifted it straight to Dean Hammond, who was clattered from behind by Hutton. Penalty claims fell on deaf ears despite contact being apparent. Nugent then rounded off his hat-trick of near misses as he cushioned a clearance with his chest before unleashing a dipping volley that looked destined to nestle in the back of the net. His effort struck the underside of the bar before bouncing a foot from the line and then away from goal. Leonardo Ulloa looked to be on hand to convert the rebound but his header floated onto the roof of the net. Leicester were finally rewarded when Konchesky broke the deadlock in first-half stoppage time. Ulloa collected a thrown-in from the right and acrobatically hooked it into the six yard box where it appeared Hutton had seemingly relieved the danger. But in came the left-back who slotted inside Guzan’s post. James came close to extending the Foxes' lead but his header drew a fine save from Guzan as the second half passed with few clear-cut chances on goal. Nugent and Alrbighton’s opportunism was nearly rewarded but another sublime save from Guzan denied the winger before Clark denied his former team-mate for finding the net. Nigel Pearson’s side had another penalty claim waved away in the second half at Ulloa dithered in possession after Knockaert’s excellent play down the right created another great opening for the hosts. Clark appeared to have fouled the Argentine but his hesitation really was to blame for his failure to double his side’s lead. And the game took a turn for the worse when, in the final moments of the game, James saw red for a high challenge on Okore. On seeing the tackle Clark reacted furiously, shoulder-barging James to the ground before sparking a tussle which ended with him receiving a second booking. It compounded a disappointing day for Villa who are without a win since their victory over Leicester in December and they drop to 13th in the Premier League, five points clear of their opponents.

Andy Carroll scored a fine goal to give the visitors the lead before the break but Swansea levelled things late on when a header by Bafetimbi Gomis found the net via Mark Noble. The Hammers, with Neil McDonald taking charge on the bench due to an illness to Sam Allardyce, almost forced a winner but found Lukasz Fabianski in good form and the points were shared. McDonald had West Ham lined up in a 3-5-2 formation and the away side appeared content to soak up pressure in the early stages as Swansea started the brighter. Gomis, deputising for Manchester City target Wilfried Bony while the Ivorian is on Africa Cup of Nations duty, had the first opportunity but couldn’t get on the end of Nathan Dyer’s cross. Draw disappoints McDonald Draw disappoints McDonald However, the Hammers soon got a foothold in the game with Carroll holding the ball up well in attack and Carl Jenkinson and Kevin Nolan each curling right-footed efforts over the bar. Gomis looked a real handful for the Swans but was dispossessed when one-on-one with James Tomkins and further chances were spurned by Gylfi Sigurdsson. Twice the attacking midfielder was fed by Dyer on the right but he failed to connect properly both times and the home side were soon made to pay for their profligacy in front of goal. Opening goal Stewart Downing swung in a cross from the left and Carroll took the ball on his chest before nodding it away from Ashley Williams. There was still plenty of cover but Carroll proceeded to drop the shoulder to buy a yard of space from Federico Fernandez and curled the ball left-footed into the far corner of the net. Garry Monk’s side attempted to respond immediately but Jenkinson produced a brilliant piece of last-ditch defending to deny Wayne Routledge from point-blank range. Monk happy with a point Monk happy with a point After the interval, West Ham continued to look a threat with Jenkinson enjoying his wing-back role and finding Carroll with a low cross to the near post that the striker fired just wide of the post. James Collins subsequently headed wide from Downing’s corner before Enner Valencia almost latched onto an Adrian goal-kick when Rangel misjudged his header back to his own goalkeeper. Swansea’s possession failing to find a way beyond a compact West Ham defence to the frustration of the crowd with one overhit cross by Routledge seeming to sum things up. Monk tried to freshen things up by removing Dyer and Routledge for Modou Barrow and Marvin Emnes and the latter immediately set up Gomis only for the striker to spoon his shot over the bar. But with West Ham defending ever deeper, the equaliser did come in the 74th minute when Gomis headed Sigurdsson’s left-wing corner against the post and the ball ricocheted in off Noble. Emotion Gomis didn’t seem to mind and appeared overcome by emotion when celebrating with a French flag, calling to mind the tragic events in Paris earlier in the week. If that might have been the prelude to some late Swansea pressure, West Ham had other ideas with Downing and Jenkinson forcing fine saves from Fabianski in quick succession. A sweeping move from West Ham led to another corner that Tomkins headed goalwards only for Neil Taylor to clear off the line as Swansea looked to be buckling. Aaron Cresswell tested Fabianski with a low free-kick that the goalkeeper spilled and Carroll looked set to bundle home the winner only for the Pole to react quickly to deny him. There were no further opportunities and while Swansea and West Ham extend their winless streaks to three and four games respectively, their efforts showed why both remain in the top half. Soccer Saturday analysis – Matt Le Tissier Fabianski was the busier goalkeeper of the two and Swansea probably had a little more possession than West Ham, but I thought in the end a draw was a pretty fair result. Fabianski made a couple of very good saves, particularly one from Downing. I would imagine Arsenal are maybe looking at that and thinking ‘he may be better than what we’ve got’. I was really impressed with Jenkinson down the right-hand side; he pushed on a lot during the game and got himself into some good crossing positions. He was a real threat down the right-hand side.

"Premier League: Alan Pardew off to winning start at Crystal Palace after thrilling Tottenham victory Jason Puncheon celebrates his winner for Crystal Palace Alan Pardew enjoyed a winning start as Crystal Palace manager in the Premier League after a pulsating second-half comeback secured a 2-1 victory over Tottenham Hotspur. Selhurst Park was rocking for the return of Pardew but the first half was a scrappy affair that saw excellent chances spurned by Christian Eriksen and Glenn Murray. The game burst into life shortly after the break as Harry Kane continued his superb goalscoring form by firing past Julian Speroni from the edge of the box. It looked as though the goal might be enough to secure victory for Spurs until a dramatic comeback from Palace. Dwight Gayle levelled from the spot in the 69th minute after Benjamin Stambouli was penalised for sliding in on Joe Ledley. Jason Puncheon says Palace's positive approach in the second half was key to their victory. Jason Puncheon says Palace's positive approach in the second half was key to their victory. And Selhurst Park erupted again 10 minutes later as Jason Puncheon drilled the winner past Hugo Lloris to send the home fans wild. It was a dream finish for Pardew’s Palace, who for much of the match had been subdued by Spurs and restricted to few clear opportunities on goal. With Yannick Bolasie and Mile Jedinak away on international duty, Pardew handed a first Premier League start of the season to Murray alongside Gayle up front. Spurs made two changes from their New Year’s Day win over Chelsea, bringing in Mousa Dembele and Benjamin Stambouli for Ryan Mason and Nabil Bentaleb, and they dominated possession in the early stages. Mauricio Pochettino felt Palace's penalty was questionable. Mauricio Pochettino felt Palace's penalty was questionable. When Palace did manage to string together a decent spell of passes each was loudly cheered by the home fans, but it should have been Spurs who were celebrating after 22 minutes. Kyle Walker’s low cross from the right bounced up for Eriksen, who got a good contact but fired wide from eight yards out. Palace had their first chance moments later as James McArthur headed over from Gayle’s cross, and the home side started to show signs of improvement. They should have taken the lead after 34 minutes when McArthur flicked the ball on for Murray, who was one-on-one with Lloris but saw his shot well saved by the keeper.

But Stambouli’s decision to slide in on Ledley in the box in the 67th minute proved to be pivotal. Referee Anthony Taylor pointed to the spot and Gayle dispatched the penalty past Lloris to level the scores. The momentum now looked to be with Palace and, moments after Puncheon was incensed by a decision not to award the hosts a handball, the winger fired home the winner. Substitute Wilfried Zaha showed excellent skill on the left to beat two defenders and his cross deflected into the path of Puncheon, who swept his shot into the corner. The goal sent Selhurst Park into raptures and the home side held on to secure victory despite a late Spurs penalty appeal after a challenge in the box on Kane by Ledley.

Ryan Shawcross opened the scoring early on, only for Radamel Falcao to equalise midway through the first half, and while both teams had opportunities, neither could force a winner. The draw extends United’s unbeaten run to 10 Premier League matches, but they were made to battle for the point in a keenly-fought contest. Stoke share spoils with Man Utd Stoke share spoils with Man Utd The home side started strongly in the windy conditions and forced the opening goal inside two minutes after Steven N’Zonzi won a corner on the right flank. Peter Crouch escaped his marker with ease and had a free header from deep that was helped into the net by Shawcross from close range against his former club. Uncomfortable The United back three, featuring Jonny Evans, Phil Jones and Chris Smalling together for the first time this season, looked particularly uncomfortable and Evans was almost caught out soon after. After allowing the ball to bounce, the defender surrendered possession to Mame Biram Diouf and the Stoke striker got free, only to miscue his left-footed shot when one-on-one with David de Gea. United succeeded in getting their passing game going after these early scares and were rewarded with an equaliser courtesy of the industrious Falcao. Van Gaal: We only deserved a point Van Gaal: We only deserved a point Wayne Rooney’s corner was flicked on by Michael Carrick and the Colombian striker was quickest to react in guiding the ball low into the far corner of the net with his left foot. United had another warning soon after, when Geoff Cameron headed wide from Marko Arnautovic’s free-kick, but opportunities from open play were at a premium. United dominated the early part of the second half without creating much as Stoke, who were playing with confidence having won their previous two games, seemed content to play on the counter-attack. Handball One of those advances saw Jones head wide of his own post with Crouch lurking, before Smalling was fortunate to get away with a strong shout for handball from the subsequent corner. The incident seemed to lift the home team and they pushed on again, with Crouch hitting the far post with a flicked header from another Arnautovic free-kick, before Diouf also went close. Hughes left disappointed Hughes left disappointed United, who lost Ashley Young to a hamstring injury in the second half, did go close through Robin van Persie but rarely looked to have enough to find a breakthrough of their own. As a result, the two teams were forced to settle for a point apiece, with both taking some comfort from the fact that they succeeded in extending their unbeaten runs.

The 53-year-old is expected to become the new Palace boss after the Eagles agreed compensation with Newcastle for their former midfielder. He watched Yannick Bolasie come closest to handing the visitors a precious three points in their battle against the drop, but his shot cannoned against the crossbar. Villa also had chances as Alan Hutton and a Leandro Bacuna free-kick tested Julian Speroni, while Christian Benteke missed a golden opportunity to grab victory. The result continued Villa's worries in front of goal – Paul Lambert's side having scored just 11 times in 20 games – but Pardew would have been pleased by Palace's gritty outing. Keith Millen confident Palace will avoid relegation Keith Millen confident Palace will avoid relegation Palace remain the the relegation zone – a point from safety – while Villa moved up to 12th, five points clear of their opponents. Villa started brightly and Benteke forced Speroni into a low save inside the first minute and the returning Gabriel Agbonlahor then skied over. The hosts pinned Palace back and only a fine save from Speroni denied Hutton from point blank range after Aly Cissokho cashed in on Adrian Mariappa's indecision. But Villa suffered a blow after 15 minutes when skipper Ron Vlaar limped off with a suspected calf injury and was replaced by Ciaran Clark. And the visitors should have gone ahead after a minute later when Bolasie blew a golden chance. The midfielder capitalised on a lucky break of the ball to run the length of the Villa half, leaving Clark for dead, but only managed to smash the bar with just 'keeper Brad Guzan to beat. It was the last flashpoint of a dour half though with the teams cancelling each other out. Both lacked the creativity and nous to raise the tempo of a game played at pedestrian pace. Palace had scored just two goals in six matches while Villa had netted just once in their last four outings prior to the game, so the half-time stalemate was no surprise. Tom Cleverley's shot was deflected wide after Villa were jeered off at the break and Benteke planted a header wide as they tried to inject some much-needed excitement in the second half. Cissokho then produced a vital tackle on James McArthur on the hour as the sides continued to cancel each other out. But Benteke should have made it 1-0 with 19 minutes left when he arrowed a 12-yard effort over the bar after collecting Carlos Sanchez's pass. It summed up the game and Speroni punched Bacuna's free kick away with four minutes left in the final lacklustre action.

Both teams started well, with plenty of endeavour shown by both sets of players. However, having conceded 31 goals already this campaign, the Toffees' lacklustre backline allowed the home side to put themselves in command before the break. First, Ahmed Elmohamady ghosted in and beat a flat-flooted Leighton Baines to head his side in front. Then, as the men in blue stood and watched, former Everton hitman Nikica Jelavic had all the time in the world to loop the ball over the onrushing Joel Robles to double his side’s lead. The introduction of Romelu Lukaku after the break gave the visitors more impetus, but once again poor defending was the Toffees’ undoing. Antolin Alcaraz was given his marching orders in the dying moments for a second bookable offence to make the afternoon even more painful for the travelling Toffees faithful. Steve Bruce delighted with win Steve Bruce delighted with win The loss is Everton’s fourth defeat in a row – a run that sees Martinez’s men languishing down in 13th - while a welcome three points for the Tigers sees them rise to 16th. The visitors almost unpicked Hull in a matter of seconds, with Seamus Coleman and Arouna Kone creating an overlap on the right, but once that danger was cleared the shift in tone was immediate. Hull should have had a second-minute penalty when their first attack ended in Abel Hernandez being bundled over by Gareth Barry. Referee Kevin Friend instead awarded a free-kick just outside the box, only for replays to show the incident taking place several inches further forward. The Toffees had chances to break the pattern of the game, not least when Ross Barkley finally imposed himself on proceedings with a barrelling 30-yard dash through midfield. He came to an abrupt stop as Curtis Davies blocked his path at the very edge of the area and when Friend waved play on, Barkley appeared incredulous. Roberto Martinez wants support from fans Roberto Martinez wants support from fans Hull's dominance paid off in the 33rd minute, when Liam Rosenior, on for the injured Andy Robertson, arced a fine cross to the far post, where Elmohamady made surprisingly light work of Baines' challenge to nod into the bottom corner. Defensive jitters The goal only increased the visitors' defensive jitters, Hernandez and Jake Livermore both having chances before Jelavic made it 2-0 just before the break. With Everton pressing high, Hernandez hooked a bouncing ball over his shoulder and played Jelavic in. The Croatian was left one on one with Robles and held his nerve with a delicate lobbed finish before a modest celebration. Martinez swapped Kevin Mirallas and Muhamed Besic for Lukaku and Bryan Oviedo at the break, but Everton almost conceded at a goalmouth scramble moments into the second half. Rosenior suffered a nasty knee injury in the 55th minute and with the hosts temporarily down to 10, Barkley almost netted for the Toffees. With a deft turn and a couple of clever touches, he carved space in a crowded box, only to see his powerful shot bravely blocked by Hull goalkeeper Allan McGregor. Lukaku added purpose to the away side's attacks but his best effort, a looping header across goal, landed on the roof of the net. The day ended on another sour note for Martinez, who saw Alcaraz dismissed late on for a harsh second booking, but with champions Manchester City up next, the Spanish chieftain has it all to do to salvage anything from what has been a disappointing campaign. Soccer Saturday verdict – Matt Le Tissier Matt Le Tissier says Hull thoroughly deserved their win over Everton Matt Le Tissier says Hull thoroughly deserved their win over Everton “Hull certainly needed this and they thoroughly deserved it as well. They were the better team and the more threatening team. Everton looked very much out of sorts, but fair play to Hull who had to cope with a couple of injuries to Robertson, who was replaced by Rosenior who himself got injured. They had to cope with a few reshuffles, but did it very well and looked the most dangerous side.” Player ratings Hull City: McGregor (7), Robertson (6), Elmohamady (7), Chester (8), Davies (8), Bruce (7), Meyler (8), Livermore (7), Ramirez (6), Jelavic (7), Hernandez (8).

The hosts went 2-0 up in the first half through two Steven Gerrard spot-kicks; the first coming in the 15th minute and the second five minutes before the break. But Leicester turned the game on its head when David Nugent and Jeff Schlupp scored within the space of two minutes to level the match, with 30 minutes still to play. And the Premier League’s bottom side had chances to win it as they held on for a valuable point in their fight against relegation. Leicester nearly opened the scoring in the first minute when Riyad Mahrez shot straight from a free-kick after he was fouled by Kolo Toure, but fortunately for Simon Mignolet the ball bounced onto the post. The visitors gave possession away easily moments later when Richie De Laet lost out to Jordan Henderson on the edge of the box but the assistant referee flagged for offside. Nigel Pearson praises his Leicester side for showing character to come from two goals down to draw 2-2 at Liverpool Nigel Pearson praises his Leicester side for showing character to come from two goals down to draw 2-2 at Liverpool Ben Hamer showed good awareness in the 10th minute as Philippe Coutinho sent a ball forward for Raheem Sterling to run onto, but the former Charlton goalkeeper was out early to collect confidently. Minutes later, the visitors had a chance after some poor defending by Emre Can left Schlupp free to speed down the left flank, but the lively Mahrez sent his chance over. The first goal came in the 16th minute when referee Mike Jones penalised Wes Morgan for handball as Sterling’s low cross hit the defender as he slid in, although replays suggested that it hit his face first. Gerrard, who was restored to the starting XI after being left on the bench against Swansea, stepped up and his sent his shot into the far right of the goal. Liverpool's Steven Gerrard scores from the penalty spot Liverpool won their second penalty of the game in the 40th minute and again it came from the impressive work of Sterling as his ball struck Danny Simpson on the arm. Gerrard stepped up again and fired into the other corner to make it 2-0. On the stroke of half-time an out-swinging corner found Henderson on the edge of the box, but he couldn’t get his powerful shot on target. Leicester refused to lie down after the break and Jamie Vardy had space on the ball in the 48th minute after beating the offside trap, but Mamadou Sakho defended well to clear,. Liverpool’s injury worries increased as Adam Lallana – who was impressive for 50 minutes – was replaced by Fabio Borini. And Brendan Rodgers’ woes increased as Leicester began a remarkable comeback. Nugent got one back for the visitors in the 58th minute when Vardy knocked the ball down for him on the edge of the box and the striker smashed home a brilliant goal. David Nugent says Leicester full deserved their point at Liverpool with a hard working performance David Nugent says Leicester full deserved their point at Liverpool with a hard working performance The league’s bottom side equalised just two minutes later though Schlupp. A Simpson throw-in was brought into the box by Mahrez and he found Schlupp in acres of space before the German sent his left-foot shot past a flailing Mignolet. Lucas tried to give the hosts their lead back in the 70th minute but his shot didn’t have the power to beat Hamer on the line. With just seven minutes left, Leicester looked more likely to get the winner as Liverpool failed to marshal their visitors’ corner and Mignolet failed to collect a corner. The home team broke on the counter-attack, but Henderson couldn’t get his shot on target from Coutinho’s through ball. Liverpool were left appealing for a third penalty in the 87th minute when Morgan and Borini tussled for the ball and the striker fell to the floor – but this time referee Jones did not point to the spot. Brendan Rodgers admitted Liverpool were lucky to get a point Brendan Rodgers admitted Liverpool were lucky to get a point Lazar Markovic had a late chance to win it when he got a head to Sterling’s cross but he sent it wide after the England winger’s good work. Nugent had another chance with just two minutes left but Sakho was there to make a block before Liverpool went up the other end and Coutinho collected Sterling’s pass and shot over. Mahrez took a free-kick in the 90th minute but some diligent defending by Sakho cleared the danger and the spoils were ultimately shared. Leicester remain bottom of the Premier League, but they are now only three points from safety while Liverpool are eighth and seven points away from a coverted Champions League spot.

Yaya Toure unleashed a 25-yard stunner to open the scoring in the 57th minute after City had struggled to break Sunderland down during a dire first half. City were two up after Stevan Jovetic started and ended a neat move with a flick at the near post, before Sunderland's Jack Rodwell halved the deficit with a header against his former club. Adam Johnson, another ex-City man, equalised from the penalty spot after Billy Jones was brought down by Pablo Zabaleta, but substitute Lampard - whose services on loan have now been secured until the end of the season - headed in for the game’s fifth goal to hand City all three points. Yaya Toure: Opened the scoring for Manchester City It took City nearly 35 minutes to test former goalkeeper Costel Pantilimon, David Silva’s fizzing effort from 25 yards was being batted away by the Romanian. That half-chance came after Silva had pulled wide from a good position 15 yards out as City registered all the possession but no cutting edge. City manager Manuel Pellegrini brought in Willy Cabellero at the expense of England No 1 Joe Hart, and it was the Argentine who made the best save in the first 45 minutes. After Pablo Zabaleta brought down Jordi Gomez just outside the area during a rare Sunderland attack, Sebastian Larsson’s set-piece was pushed away well by Cabellero. Pablo Zabaleta delivers under pressure from Adam Johnson The second half came to life after Toure’s stunning opener, the Ivorian letting fly from outside the penalty area to give Pantilimon no chance in the Sunderland goal. And City were soon two up, Jovetic offloading to Gael Clichy down the left before the Frenchman returned the favour to find the Montenegrin six yards out. He duly knocked the ball past Pantilimon with a fine flick. Sunderland immediately found a way back into the game, halving the deficit after Rodwell flicked on a Larsson corner to give Caballero no chance. Lampard: Heads home the winner City hit the post through the impressive Jesus Navas, but the game was level again moments later after Billy Jones was brought down by Zabaleta inside the area, with Johnson sending Caballero the wrong way from the spot. But substitute Lampard found a yard in between two Sunderland defenders after 73 minutes to head into the corner of Pantilimon’s goal from Clichy’s cross. City had several opportunities to add to their lead after Lampard’s goal, but Pantilimon denied Lampard from a volley, Fernandinho from close range and Navas from a tight angle. Soccer Saturday verdict – Paul Merson Paul Merson says Sunderland's first half defensive display was superb but they unfortunately ran out of steam as they fell to defeat at Manchester City. Paul Merson says Sunderland's first half defensive display was superb but they unfortunately ran out of steam as they fell to defeat at Manchester City. “For 56 minutes, this game was terrible. It was slow and so lethargic. I couldn’t see there being a goal and then Yaya Toure hit one into the top corner from 25 yards out and at 2-0 I thought that was it. Two ex-Man City players then scored for Sunderland and you think that’s it for Man City before Frank Lampard came on. What a header. He put the ball exactly where it should be. Sunderland were out on their feet in the end, but if you ever want to see a team defend how they should defend then you should look at Sunderland in the first half.” Player ratings Man City: Caballero

"Newcastle United and Burnley drew 3-3 at St James’ Park in a topsy-turvy Premier League affair on New Year’s Day. The home side led 2-1 at half-time thanks to strikes by local boys Steven Taylor and Jack Colback, with an embarrassing Paul Dummett own goal sandwiched in between them. However, Sean Dyche’s men responded after the break to deservedly draw level through striker Danny Ings, only for Magpies midfielder Moussa Sissoko to seemingly hand his side all three points by firing home from close range 12 minutes from time. And yet the Clarets refused to lie down and accept their fate, with midfielder George Boyd netting an 86th-minute equaliser to deny John Carver what would have been a winning start to his spell in temporary charge of the North East club. Carver’s first decision to make was who should replace the suspended Papiss Cisse in attack after the Senegal international was suspended by the Football Association for elbowing Everton right-back Seamus Coleman on Sunday. And the Newcastle-born coach opted for new signing Emmanuel Riviere to lead the line, with hometown central defender Taylor also being recalled at the back in place of Mike Williamson. Sean Dyche proud of Burnley's form Sean Dyche proud of Burnley's form The visitors, meanwhile, went with the same starting line-up for an incredible sixth match in a row, and they very nearly rewarded their manager’s faith by opening the scoring after just 52 seconds. However, Newcastle goalkeeper Jak Alnwick managed to get a fingertip to divert Burnley striker Ashley Barnes’s close-range shot from a tight angle to safety with the help of the post. But thereafter it was the Magpies who dominated proceedings, with Taylor deservedly putting them in front on the quarter-hour mark as he rose to head Colback’s right-wing corner past a helpless Tom Heaton in the Burnley goal. And while the visitors did draw level just four minutes later when Dummett got too much on his header back to the onrushing Alnwick, Newcastle soon found themselves back in front when man-of-the-match Colback struck a sweet left-footed effort past Heaton from fully 25 yards out. Despite making three enforced substitutions before half-time, it was Burnley who came out the stronger of the two teams after the break, with the Premier League strugglers striking the woodwork on three separate occasions in the space of the opening 15 minutes of the second period. John Carver says Newcastle did not deserve a point John Carver says Newcastle did not deserve a point Firstly, Ings curled a brilliant effort off the underside of Alnwick’s bar, with his strike partner Barnes then heading the rebound on to the post, before defender Ben Mee saw his close-range header from a left-wing corner also thump against the Newcastle crossbar. But the Clarets did get their just rewards minutes later when Ings headed home his first goal in seven games, only for Newcastle to respond to that setback by retaking the lead after 78 minutes following good work by the impressive Ayoze Perez. The Spain Under-21 international somehow managed to wriggle his way past a plethora of Burnley defenders on the left-hand touchline and while his pull back was mis-hit by substitute Adam Armstrong, Sissoko was in the right place at the right time to side-foot his side back in front at the far post. And yet Burnley refused to give in, with midfielder Boyd firing a low shot past Alnwick from just inside the area with only four minutes left on the clock to rescue a point and break Newcastle's, and Carver's, heart. Matt Murray praised Burnley's effort and fighting spirit Matt Murray praised Burnley's effort and fighting spirit Soccer Saturday verdict – Matt Murray “Burnley will take confidence from this performance, especially the energy levels in the second half. The way they responded when they found themselves behind was excellent again. At a packed St James’ Park they believed they could get back into the game and they hit the woodwork on numerous occasions. Sean Dyche will now be hoping that the injuries aren’t too serious. After the FA Cup game there’s QPR, Palace, Sunderland and West Brom so there’s four games that maybe you could say are season defining if they can put in the performance in that they have here.”

"Wilfried Bony came off the bench to net a dramatic late equaliser for 10-man Swansea City as they drew 1-1 with Queens Park Rangers at Loftus Road. Harry Redknapp's men should have been down to 10 men themselves after Rob Green handled the ball outside his area with just five minutes on the clock. And having been reprieved, they went on to take the lead after 20 minutes through Leroy Fer’s 25-yard thunderbolt. Former QPR man Wayne Routledge was sent off for the visitors with seven minutes remaining after kicking out at Karl Henry following a nasty tackle by the midfielder, for which he was booked. Getting someting from the game looked a tall order for Swansea at that point, but Bony found space in the QPR box in stoppage time to skilfully toe-poke a last-gasp leveller. Garry Monk criticises officials Garry Monk criticises officials Early let-off Green had performed heroics in the QPR goal to keep the score down to just 2-0 in the reverse fixture earlier this season and he should have been walking down the tunnel with just five minutes gone as he clearly handled outside his area. Gylfi Sigurdsson’s perfectly weighted through-ball sent Routledge clear one-on-one with the goalkeeper, who rushed out quickly to meet the striker and got to the ball but deflected it away with his arm outside the area. No foul was given. QPR used that slice of fortune to their advantage and took the lead 15 minutes later in emphatic style. Clint Hill's forward ball was headed weakly away by Federico Fernandez and Fer controlled the ball, let it bounce for a couple of strides before unleashing a ferocious 25-yard strike into the top corner for his third goal of the season. Swansea always looked a threat on the counter attack through Routledge and Nathan Dyer, but good openings were continually wasted by Bafetimbi Gomis, who was picked ahead of eight-goal Bony amid speculation of a move away from the club. Harry Redknapp gutted after late equaliser Harry Redknapp gutted after late equaliser QPR striker Charlie Austin came agonisingly close to doubling his side’s lead early in the second half, but his header from eight yards bounced back off the base of the post. Bony was introduced with 20 minutes remaining and his introduction injected spark into the game, but it then boiled over with seven minutes remaining as Swansea went in search of an equaliser. Minutes after Bony had tested Green with a 20-yard free-kick, QPR midfielder Henry flew into a tackle on Routledge that Swansea manager Garry Monk called a “leg-breaking challenge\". Tensions rise The Swansea winger was irate with the foul and there was a minor scuffle with Henry involving a tangle of legs. Both sets of players waded in, Henry was booked for the tackle and after speaking to his linesman, Routledge was given a red card for an apparent kick out on his opponent. With the clock ticking past the 90-minute mark, QPR had a chance to take the ball into the corner but Junior Hoilett decided to shoot and presented possession back to Swansea. A minute later, the visitors were level through a moment of magic from Bony. Ki Sung-yueng broke down the left before finding the striker in the box. With his back to goal, he managed to shift the ball on to his right foot and fire a quick-fire toe poke into the top corner. Wilfried Bony felt Swansea fully deserved their 1-1 draw Wilfried Bony felt Swansea fully deserved their 1-1 draw The drama didn’t end there, though, as Austin had a wonderful chance to snatch the points back for the hosts with the last kick of the game. After Joey Barton’s shot was spilled by Lukasz Fabianski inside the six-yard box, Austin reacted quickest but his shot was deflected over the bar when the ball seemed destined for the net.

Sadio Mane put Ronald Koeman’s men in front with a brilliant finish from a tight angle after a mix-up in the Arsenal defence, before Dusan Tadic profited from more miscommunication to poke the hosts 2-0 up after half-time. Graziano Pelle hit the upright twice in the match, while Tadic had plenty more chances as the hosts spurned several opportunities to kill the visitors off at St Mary's. But it wouldn’t matter, as Wenger’s men couldn’t find a way back into the match, and the hosts took the victory to keep their place in the Champions League spots after a fine win. The hosts were without the suspended Morgan Schneiderlin after the Frenchman’s red against Chelsea, so James Ward-Prowse came in, while Koeman also shuffled the defence around. Arsenal, meanwhile, deployed Calum Chambers in a defensive midfield role as the visitors made three changes, with Kieran Gibbs and Tomas Rosicky also given starts. Ronald Koeman delighted with team spirit Ronald Koeman delighted with team spirit Weak defending The game opened up early on and Southampton nearly put themselves in front but Pelle could only head Tadic's looped cross wide off the post, with Wojciech Szczesny stranded. Alexis Sanchez then tested Fraser Forster at the other end with a low drive, before the Saints goalkeeper was called into action once more, this time denying Santi Cazorla after good work by Debuchy on the right-hand side. But it was the hosts who opened the scoring 10 minutes before the break, as Mane chased a long ball over the top and got in behind Laurent Koscielny. Szczesny raced out to close him down, but the Senegal forward nudged it away from the goalkeeper before turning and curling a left-footed shot into the net from a tight angle, with Per Mertesacker unable to keep it from going over the line. It was nearly 2-0 before the break as Mane again found space on the right and played the ball back to the edge of the box for Ward-Prowse, whose low first-time effort was superbly diverted away with his feet by Szczesny. Arsenal put the pressure on the hosts from the off in the second half and would have levelled but for a superb save from Forster to deny Sanchez. Tadic delivers The Saints made them pay for the miss as they doubled their leads moment later, benefiting from more calamitous defending from the Gunners. Steven Davis brought the ball down and fired it across the box, and Mathieu Debuchy and Szczesny couldn’t clear properly, before Tadic popped up to poke the ball home from close range. Arsene Wenger disappointed with defending Arsene Wenger disappointed with defending Tadic then curled an effort past the post before Pelle hit the upright for the second time, firing Bertrand’s low cross on to the frame of the goal as Ward-Prowse blasted the rebound over. Southampton nearly profited from yet another defensive error as Koscielny sold Szczesny short with a pass back, and Pelle stole the ball before Tadic saw his attempt cleared off the line by Debuchy. Arsenal may have felt they should have been up against 10 men for the later stages as Florin Gardos fouled Sanchez with the Chilean clean through, but he was only booked. Sanchez whipped the resulting free kick over the bar. The Saints held the visitors at arm’s length as the clock ticked down, and they saw out a superb 2-0 victory to beat Arsenal in the Premier League for the first time in 11 attempts. Soccer Saturday verdict – Tony Cottee “It’s easy to be critical of Arsenal, but I want to give Southampton praise. I saw them against Chelsea and they were defensively fantastic and it was exactly the same today. They defended as they had to and they defended properly. I could have been talking about a 4-0 or 5-0 to Southampton and you couldn’t say they wouldn’t have deserved it. They were absolutely outstanding.

Albion team earned a battling 1-1 draw with West Ham United at Upton Park. Saido Berahino struck just before half-time to cancel out an early opener from Diafra Sakho in an entertaining first period, while Aaron Cresswell's thundering free-kick against the post was a rare highlight in the second. With Pulis set to take charge of the first team for Saturday's FA Cup tie with Gateshead, Albion turned in an impressive performance that ended a run of three consecutive defeats, although they have won only one of their last 10 matches. The visitors were the better team in the early stages, with Stephane Sessegnon in particular pulling the strings in midfield from the outset. The Benin international had a shot well blocked by James Collins after the first of many incisive, driving runs, while Cresswell stabbed tamely at Ben Foster as West Ham began to atone for a sluggish start. Sucker punch The Hammers barely got out of their own half in the first 10 minutes, but they still managed to take the lead in the 11th minute as Cresswell whipped in a superb first-time cross from the left for an unmarked Sakho to glance past Foster from close range. Ben Foster says Tony Pulis' arrival has given the players a boost Ben Foster says Tony Pulis' arrival has given the players a boost Stewart Downing's deflected shot was blocked by Foster before the Baggies almost levelled when Youssuf Mulumbu’s cross to the far post was met by a cracking first-time volley from Chris Baird, but Adrian pulled off a smart reaction save to keep his side in front. Sessegnon scuffed wide and Chris Brunt hooked inches past the upright as Albion continued to press, while James Morrison’s curling effort sailed narrowly over the bar. But three minutes before the break, West Brom were rewarded for their attacking intent as Sessegnon sauntered down the left from a flowing counter-attack and crossed low for Berahino, who side-footed calmly past Adrian from 10 yards. Close shaves Berahino came close to doubling his tally five minutes after the interval, when his shot took a wild deflection off Collins and was beaten away at full stretch by Adrian. Mulumbu blazed into the side-netting from another neat lay-off by Sessegnon, but it was West Ham who came closest to another goal when Cresswell’s cracking 25-yard free-kick cleared the wall and beat Foster, only for the ball to cannon off the foot of the post. Matt Jarvis failed to make a decent connection with a near-post centre from Enner Valencia, and Sessegnon dragged another shot wide in the closing stages.

A first-half Spurs blitz stunned Chelsea as goals from Kane on the half-hour mark, Danny Rose a minute from the break and Andros Townsend deep into first-half stoppage time erased Diego Costa’s 18th-minute opener for the league leaders. Kane looked have put the game beyond Chelsea’s reach with a great finish seven minutes into the second half but Eden Hazard’s opportunistic response three minutes later set up a tense atmosphere at White Hart Lane. Jose Mourinho says his side were denied a major decision Spurs Jose Mourinho says his side were denied a major decision Spurs The bright Nacer Chadli then all-but secured the points for Spurs with a fifth 12 minutes from time before John Terry’s goal three minutes from time reduced the deficit but failed to spark a late comeback as the hosts held on. Spurs move up to fifth as Mauricio Pochettino’s men extended their unbeaten run to six games in the league, following their last defeat to Jose Mourinho’s men at the start of December. The result sees Chelsea miss the opportunity to retain a clear lead at the top of the table. Chelsea and Manchester City are deadlocked on 46 points and are also level on goal difference and goals scored. Chelsea lead the league on alphabetical order. Both sides entered the New Year’s Day fixture on the back of draws in their finals game of 2014. And both managers made three changes ahead of the game which saw both sides make an even start to proceedings. Chadli had an early sighter with a speculative 25-yard strike which was comfortably saved by Thibaut Courtois. Cesc Fabregas and Costa tried initiate a connection in the opening exchanges with a long-range pass up field before Ryan Mason’s over-exuberance to latch on to Townsend’s through ball saw him limp off with a hamstring injury. John Terry of Chelsea shows his dejection But despite the even start to the game it was the visitors who broke the deadlock. Chelsea launched a counter through Hazard and after the Belgian had seen his effort strike the post, land at Oscar’s feet and make its way back across goal, Costa pounced from inside the six-yard box to tap home. What followed was an onslaught from the away side as Hazard and Costa terrorised the Spurs defence in a 10-minute spell which the game ultimately pivoted on. But instead of Chelsea doubling their lead it was Spurs who drew level against the run of play. Kane collected the ball in midfield and meandered towards the Chelsea area. After fending off a feeble challenge from Oscar, the England U21 international shot low to Courtois’ right from 25 yards to restore parity. However it was to be the closing stages of the first half which were to catch Chelsea really off-guard as Spurs took the lead and then doubled their advantage within five minutes. First Christian Eriksen benefitted from Kane’s dummy to play Chadli in the behind the Chelsea defence. The Belgian saw his shot strike the post but roll into the path of left-back Danny Rose who guided the ball into the bottom corner before being up-ended by Gary Cahill. Andros Townsend of Spurs celebrates The England centre-back’s rash challenging was to be punished minutes later as the game approached the break. Kane, again, proved to be the catalyst, beating Cahill to the ball inside the box before falling victim to another of his strong challenges. Townsend made no mistake with the spot-kick, rifling into the bottom left-hand corner. And Spurs survived a spirited Chelsea response in the start of the second period to further extend their lead with another well-taken individual goal from Kane. This time the striker swivelled on Chadli pass from the left flank before curling low drive past Courtois. Hazard pulled one back for Chelsea within three minutes of Kane’s strike – capitalising on Federico Fazio’s casualness in possession, playing a one-two with Fabregas before taking a touch to control with his right and then firing home with his left. Moments later the Belgian broke free of the Spurs defence and was seemingly through on goal. A coming together involving himself and Fazio saw the forward hit the deck and prompted Mourinho to call for the dismissal of the Argentina defender. But Phil Dowd adjudged the centre-back to have a got a touch of the ball, a point which television replays, and Hazard's sporting reaction to the challenge, confirmed. Harry Kane runs with the ball under pressure from Branislav Ivanovic Hopes of a comeback failed to materialise as Chadli’s deflected effort off Terry saw Spurs become the only side to score five goals against a Chelsea side managed by Mourinho in the Premier League. Terry steered Branislav Ivanovic's shot into an empty net three minutes from time, but that acted as mere consolation for the Blues who could have set up a grandstand finish had Ramires converted a great chance in the 90th minute. But Tottenham held on for their first victory over Chelsea since April 2010 as they Blues saw their gap at the top evaporate.

"Premier League: Adam Lallana scores twice as Liverpool beat Swansea 4-1 at Anfield to end 2014 on a high Adam Lallana: Celebrates his first goal at the Kop end Adam Lallana scored twice and Jonjo Shelvey scored an own goal as Liverpool saw off Swansea 4-1 at Anfield, meaning the Reds end 2014 in eighth place in the Premier League. Alberto Moreno scored the opener a third of the way through the game, converting from six yards after starting and ending a move involving Lallana and Jordan Henderson. Former Liverpool midfielder Shelvey could have been sent off before half-time after his flailing arm caught Emre Can, but referee Andre Marriner was unmoved. Two goals in two minutes set the game alight in the second half. First Lallana got in the way of a Lukasz Fabianski clearance for a bizarre second for Liverpool, before Gylfi Sigurdsson slotted home from six yards at the other end. Lallana extended Liverpool’s lead again, drilling home from 12 yards after a superb assist from Philippe Coutinho, and the Reds were 4-1 up with just over 20 minutes remaining after Henderson’s drilled corner was flicked in by Shelvey for an own goal. Alberto Moreno: Opened the scoring at Anfield Former Swansea boss Brendan Rodgers set Liverpool up in a 3-5-2 formation with Can one of three centre-backs and one of four changes, but the new look to his side did not dishevel them. Henderson’s drilled corner found Martin Skrtel at the far post, but the defender’s powerful header from six yards only found the hands of Lukasz Fabianski. Moreno, who attempted to get forward at every opportunity at wing back, found Raheem Sterling with a drilled cross after 15 minutes, but the Englishman’s powerful volley was straight at Fabianski. The ball bobbled around the area before falling to Lallana, who disappointingly fluffed his effort over the bar from just 12 yards. Jonjo Shelvey: Wasn't sent off after a flailing arm caught Emre Can Liverpool went ahead on 33 minutes, with Moreno starting and finishing the move. The Spaniard piled forward from the left of Liverpool’s midfield, offloaded to Lallana who then found Henderson in space on the left, before a drilled centre was converted by Moreno from six yards for his second Reds goal. The hosts nearly doubled their lead a few minutes later, Coutinho twisting and turning on the byline only to see his low effort saved from the left at the near post by Fabianski. There was controversy just before half-time when Swansea midfielder Shelvey, returning to his former club, appeared to fling his arm at Can while piling through the Liverpool defence. The second half began in bizarre fashion after Fabianski’s clearance came off the body of Lallana to loop into the Swansea net for 2-0. Brendan Rodgers waves to the Anfield crowd But the visitors went up the other end to halve the deficit just seconds later, Sigurdsson converting from close range after Mamadou Sakho headed the ball into his path. Liverpool restored the two-goal lead on 61 minutes through Lallana again, getting on the end of a fine flick from Coutinho to glide past two defenders and slot home into the bottom corner from 12 yards. And it was four with 21 minutes remaining after Shelvey flicked on a drilled corner from Henderson at the near post to leave his own goalkeeper with no chance. Bafetimbi Gomis hit the bar late on before Wayne Routledge’s effort fizzed just over from 20 yards, but Liverpool were comfortable winners on the night, leapfrogging Swansea to end 2014 on a high.

goalless draw by Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane. Juan Mata went closest to breaking the deadlock in the opening 45 minutes with a free-kick that hit the post and was hacked away on the line. Ashley Young also saw a shot brilliantly tipped over the bar by Hugo Lloris while Robin van Persie was unable to finish from a few yards out. United also had chances in the second half as Van Persie missed the target with a volley and Mata blasted over the bar from a promising position. Radamel Falcao takes a shot at goal. Spurs rarely threatened at the other end but did finish stronger and could have snatched the points as Ryan Mason fired over with just David de Gea to beat. Had Mason’s shot hit the back of the net then United would have certainly rued the chances they missed in a largely one-sided first half. Having named an unchanged Premier League team for the first time since November 2012, United looked far more settled than Spurs – who made four changes - and created all the best openings. The first sight of goal for the visitors came in the seventh minute when Mata clipped a pin-point ball over the top of the defence for Wayne Rooney, but his poor touch prevented a one-on-one chance. Mata set up another chance shortly afterwards as he slid a ball through for Radamel Falcao, who couldn’t quite sort his feet out and ended up shooting at Lloris. Spurs offered little at the other end aside from the odd counter attack and were fortunate not to fall behind after 22 minutes as Mata’s free-kick bounced off the post and was then hacked clear from under the bar. Chances continued to come and go for United with Van Persie unable to fire home from close range and Rooney seeing a header saved by Lloris. Harry Kane is pursued by Paddy McNair. The Spurs keeper then pulled out a top-drawer save as the half came to a close, tipping Young’s curling shot over the bar. Even though the hosts improved after the break, United still had opportunities, with Van Persie missing the target with a volley from 10 yards out. Mata then fired over the bar from Rafael’s pull-back, but United’s grip on the game loosened in the final 20 minutes as Spurs started to look stronger. De Gea was called upon to save Fazio’s low shot before the home side created their best chance of the match in the 82nd minute.

Saido Mane had opened the scoring for Saints but Eden Hazard found an equaliser just before half-time and a Chelsea winner looked inevitable as they enjoyed total domination after the interval. But despite Morgan Schneiderlin’s late sending-off, Ronald Koeman’s side held firm to claim a share of the points and underline their recent return to form after overcoming a run of five defeats in all competitions. The result also ends a sequence of three successive victories for Jose Mourinho’s men but is enough to ensure that Chelsea will start 2015 clear of Manchester City at the top of the table. Koeman had been forced to change his defence with Ryan Bertrand ineligible to feature against his parent club and that presented an opportunity for 19-year-old left-back Matt Targett. But with Nathaniel Clyne injured, Southampton’s makeshift back four also came under considerable pressure down their right flank in the early stages as Chelsea pushed for an opener. Fraser Forster did well to tip a left-wing corner away from the head of John Terry but the home side also went close when Jose Fonte almost got on the end of Mane’s header across goal. Breakthrough In the 17th minute, the Senegal striker did make the breakthrough himself when Terry attempted to play the offside trap but was caught out as Dusan Tadic lofted the ball behind the defence. Mane kept cool when one-on-one with Thibaut Courtois and helped the ball over the advancing goalkeeper for his fourth Premier League goal of the season as well as his second in three days. Chelsea continued to dominate the ball without showing too many signs of coming up with an equaliser as Southampton defended with tenacity, while retaining a threat at the other end. Jose Mourinho criticises referee Jose Mourinho criticises referee But just when it seemed as though Saints would reach the break with their lead intact, Hazard finally took advantage of the space out wide to level the scores in first-half stoppage time. Picking up the ball on the left, he danced beyond the retreating Maya Yoshida before cutting inside past Toby Alderweireld and firing a low shot into the far corner of Forster’s net. That this was Chelsea’s only shot on target in the opening 45 minutes was testament to the efforts of Koeman’s side but also an indication of the ruthless nature of the visitors. Jose Mourinho turned to Willian for the second half with the Brazilian replacing the ineffective Andre Schurrle who’d failed to test Targett as might have been expected. Penalty appeal Cesc Fabregas soon did so when the young full-back appeared to clip him inside the Southampton penalty area but referee Anthony Taylor instead interpreted it as a dive and booked the Spaniard. That seemed to raise the intensity of game and Hazard went close with his left foot on the hour mark but his snap shot on the turn flew just wide of the far post. Koeman again tweaked his back four with Florin Gardos replacing Yoshida and Alderweireld moving to right-back as the pressure continued to build on the home team. Ronald Koeman proud of team Ronald Koeman proud of team With a little over a quarter of an hour remaining, Mourinho showed his intent by bringing Didier Drogba on to replace John Obi Mikel in the search for three points. The opportunity was almost presented to Diego Costa when substitute James Ward-Prowse’s careless back pass looked set to find the striker only for him to slip at the crucial moment. Southampton even survived the loss of Schneiderlin with minutes remaining when the midfielder was shown a second yellow card for a foul on Fabregas as Chelsea looked to break. But there were no further scares for the hosts as Chelsea failed to muster another shot on target and both sides end the year with something to show for their improving efforts throughout 2014. Pundit Verdict – Graeme Souness “We all knew it was a penalty and it was frustrating for Jose Mourinho but it was also not very good. In 90 minutes they had one shot on target. You can look at the stats that say they had 60 per cent possession but one shot on target and none in the second half? When you dominate the ball like that you’ve got to be peppering the opposition goal. They’ve not made Fraser Forster work.” PLAYER RATINGS Southampton: Forster (7), Yoshida (5), Alderweireld (7), Fonte (7), Targett (7), Schneiderlin (6), Wanyama (7), Tadic (7), Davis (6), Mane (7), Pelle (6).

red card from referee Martin Atkinson Aston Villa held on to earn a hard fought point at home to Sunderland despite being reduced to 10-men early in the second half following Fabian Delph’s red card. In what was a poor first half at Villa Park, neither side looked like troubling the scorers with tame efforts from Connor Wickham and Charles N’Zogbia the only chances of note. But minutes after the interval the game came to life after Delph was shown a red card - Villa's third in four games - for a studs-up challenge which caught Jordi Gomez on the ankle. Sunderland tried to make their numerical advantage count and they came closest in the dying stages when Gomez’s 30-yard thunderbolt was tipped onto the post by Brad Guzan. Villa had their own opportunities to steal all three points at the death with Leandro Bacuna forcing Costel Pantilimon into a save and in the final minute of stoppage time Christian Benteke could only find the side netting as the spoils were shared. Both sides were forced to freshen things up from their Boxing Day defeats as Aston Villa recalled Andreas Weimann for the suspended Gabby Agbonlahor and Charles N'Zogbia was named in the starting line-up in place of defender Jores Okore, who dropped down to the bench. Sunderland manager Gus Poyet says he finds it incredible that his team did not score against Aston Villa. Sunderland manager Gus Poyet says he finds it incredible that his team did not score against Aston Villa. Gus Poyet made three changes following Friday's 3-1 defeat to Hull with Sebastian Coates replaced by Wes Brown and Wickham returning from suspension. Liam Bridcutt also started for the visitors with Lee Cattermole dropping down to the bench. But the changes did not have the desired effect for managers Paul Lambert and Poyet as both sides struggled to find any rhythm during the opening stages. With two of the three lowest scoring clubs in the league on show, goals were expected to be at a premium at Villa Park and both keepers had an easy ride in the first half. In the fifth minute Steven Fletcher broke forward for the visitors and found some space on the edge of the penalty area, but he took far too much time over his shot and it was deflected behind for a corner. Benteke responded for the home side just minutes later but once again his long range shot flew harmlessly over the crossbar. With defences seemingly on top, Villa looked to have been stretched when Gomez broke free down the left, but with Fletcher waiting to pounce Brad Guzan came off his line to gather the ball cleanly. Ron Vlaar was pleased to get a point in the 0-0 draw with Sunderland. Ron Vlaar was pleased to get a point in the 0-0 draw with Sunderland. Any joy Villa were having was coming down the right through Alan Hutton and their best moment came when Delph released the full-back into space. His cross picked out Weimann but after evading one challenge, the Austrian ran into John O’Shea, who made a vital challenge. Wickham tried to bring Sunderland to life on his return to the side but after Billy Jones’ lay-off, his shot from the right edge of the penalty area flew wide. Shots on target were hard to come by but just as it looked like neither side would work the goalkeeper in the first 45 minutes, N’Zogbia cut inside Jones onto his left foot but his shot was straight at Pantilimon, who held onto the ball. It wasn’t long before Sunderland were getting in on the act and it was Wickham who fired his his right-footed shot straight at Guzan, who made a routine save to bring a drab first half to a close. Immediately after the break Villa had an excellent chance to take the lead as Carlos Sanchez played in Weimann down the left side of the penalty area, but he lacked composure and screwed his shot wide of the far post. However in the 50th minute, things turned sour for Villa as Delph lunged recklessly into a challenge on Gomez with his studs showing, catching the Spaniard on the ankle and referee Martin Atkinson had no choice but to show a seventh red card in 11 league meetings between these two sides. They nearly made their numerical advantage count straight away when Adam Johnson, who was becoming increasingly influential, released Wickham but just as he was about to pull the trigger, Ron Vlaar made a vital intervention. Paul Lambert was pleased with his team's performance as they claimed a point. Paul Lambert was pleased with his team's performance as they claimed a point. Poyet threw on Emanuele Giaccherini for Seb Larsson in the 57th minute, but Lambert responded with changes of his own as Jores Okore replaced Ciaran Clark at the back. But it was Sunderland who had a grip on proceedings and Wickham turned provider for Johnson with a neat flick, but the former Manchester City man could only fire his shot straight at Guzan. If Sunderland were going to break the deadlock it looked like Johnson was the man to do it and with just over 20 minutes to go the 27-year-old latched onto substitute Cattermole’s deflected shot, before firing in a dangerous ball into the box. After a scramble in the six-yard box the ball fell to Wickham again, but his left-foot shot drifted wide of the post. The Black Cats were well and truly on top but Lambert gave his side a lifeline by introducing the impressive Jack Grealish for Tom Cleverley. The 19-year-old provided an attacking outlet for the home side, curling a shot past the far post and they could have stolen all three points when Vlaar got his head to a corner in the 76th minute, but Pantilimon was equal to the effort. With just a minute of normal time remaining, Sunderland thought they had won it when Gomez produced a 30-yard thunderbolt but Guzan just managed to get a fingertip onto the ball to tip it onto the post. The action was not over as Aston Villa broke straight back down the other end through Benteke. The home side managed to work the ball across to Bacuna, who fired a shot goalwards but once again Pantilimon stood firm to beat the ball away. There was one final chance and it fell to Benteke as he got on the end of Bacuna’s cross but, with Pantilimon rushing out, the Belgium international could only find the side netting as Villa increased their unbeaten run to seven matches against Sunderland. A point apiece leaves Aston Villa and Sunderland in 13th and 14th position in the league, still five and four points above the relegation zone respectively. Soccer Special verdict – Charlie Nicholas “Sunderland dominated after the red card and had a few opportunities, but they were also vulnerable at the back when Villa went at them. It wasn’t a classic encounter and there were hardly any efforts on goal for long periods. In the last 10 or 15 minutes it livened up quite nicely and, if anything, Paul Lambert will be happy with a point. After the red card you take what you can get.” Player Ratings Aston Villa: Guzan (8), Hutton (7), Vlaar (7), Clark (6), Cissokho (6), Cleverley (5), Delph (4), Sanchez (7), N'Zogbia (6), Weimann (5), Benteke (6).

Riyad Mahrez's well-taken strike just after the half hour mark proved to be the game's deciding moment before each side were reduced to 10 men in the closing stages on Humberside. The Algeria international produced the brightest moment of an uneventful opening 45 minutes to curl a well-directed shot past Allan McGregor. Hull rarely threatened going forward in the first half and Steve Bruce rung the changes after the interval with Nikica Jelavic, Tom Ince and Abel Hernandez coming on in the second period to bolster the Tigers attack. And it worked as the hosts put Nigel Pearson's side under real pressure in pursuit of an equaliser as both Hernandez and Jake Livermore struck the woodwork. Paul Konchesky saw red for a second bookable offence after a shoulder check on Ahmed Elmohamady, and Hull really intensified the pressure on the away goal with their extra-man advantage. Leicester manager Nigel Pearson says he is relieved to take three points against Hull. Leicester manager Nigel Pearson says he is relieved to take three points against Hull. But last man Stephen Quinn's deliberate handball prevented a Leicester counter attack in the final moments. He was shown a straight red by Phil Dowd and that ensured the visitors would take the points back to the Midlands after claiming a first league win in three months to move within three points of Hull who remain 17th. Hull’s ten game wait for Premier League win came to an end after their 3-1 Boxing Day victory at Sunderland, and the hosts were evidently buoyed by that result. But for all of their endeavour in the opening exchanges both sides enjoyed a similar start to proceedings, with neither able to carve out a clear sight of goal in a cagey and well-contested start to the game. Leicester summer signing Esteban Cambiasso gradually grew in prowess, as too did Mahrez as the pair started to dictate their side’s opportunities on the Hull goal. And it was no surprise to see them involved in what turned out to be the game’s only goal. Ben Hamer was delighted that Leicester managed to record their first victory since September with a narrow 1-0 win over Hull. Ben Hamer was delighted that Leicester managed to record their first victory since September with a narrow 1-0 win over Hull. McGregor’s goal-kick was headed to Leonardo Ulloa by Esteban Cambiasso. The Argentine flicked the ball into the path of David Nugent who picked out Mahrez on the right and, after cutting inside Hull midfielder Quinn and Liam Rosenior, he curled the ball low past the Scot. Hull looked to turn up the pressure before the break and went in search of the equaliser. Gaston Ramirez and Livermore - who filled in for the suspended James Chester - linked up well in midfield but saw their flamboyant counter cleared by Mahrez. The Algerian’s clearance though felt at the feet of Meyler who found midfield partner Quinn. The Irishman turned and whipped the ball across the face of goal where Elmohamady managed to guide the ball into the stands from six yards. Hull manager Steve Bruce says his side had more than enough chances to beat Leicester. Hull manager Steve Bruce says his side had more than enough chances to beat Leicester. Steve Bruce may have felt his side lacked a presence up front and at half time he tried to bolster his attack by bringing on Jelavic in place of Ramirez at the break. But similar to the start of the game, an edgy affair unravelled with chances at a premium. The visitors came close to doubling their lead just before the hour, but substitute Chris Wood couldn’t control Cambiasso’s instinctive quick free-kick. Livermore thought he had capitalised on Danny Simpson’s scuffed clearance, heading goal wards only to see his effort come off the woodwork. Substitute Hernandez tested Leicester keeper Ben Hamer’s reactions with a first-time volley from Elmohamady’s quick throw-in seconds before the Uruguayan headed the resulting corner onto the post for his side's second hitting of the frame of the goal in the game. Konchesky was booked for a second time for an innocuous shoulder charge on Elmohamady which gave the hosts a glimmer of hope but those hopes were dashed when Quinn saw red five minutes later for clearly blocking a Leicester counter with his hands.

The champions had appeared on course for a club-record 10th successive win in all competitions when they led 2-0 at half-time thanks to goals from David Silva and Fernandinho. However, the visitors caused a huge shock after the break by drawing level following strikes from George Boyd, albeit from an offside position, followed by a sensational Ashley Barnes goal nine minutes from time to hand the Clarets a deserved share of the spoils. City will regret dropping two valuable points on home soil though, especially given that Premier League leaders Chelsea had earlier also been held 1-1 at Southampton, meaning that the gap to the west London club remains at three points as we reach exactly the halfway point of the season. Sean Dyche says he never doubted his players’ ability to come from 2-0 down to take a point away from the Etihad. Sean Dyche says he never doubted his players’ ability to come from 2-0 down to take a point away from the Etihad. And yet Manuel Pellegrini’s side had looked in no trouble whatsoever as they left the pitch for half-time having dominated the opening 45 minutes, with two goals to show for their efforts, while it could have been many more. As after a sluggish start in which the home team appeared to be suffering the effects of having to play two games in the space of just three days, City opened the scoring midway through the first period courtesy of in-form Spain international playmaker Silva's fourth strike in his last three matches. And what a goal it was too after some lovely build-up play down the right involving Samir Nasri, Pablo Zabaleta and then finally Jesus Navas, before the little winger picked out his compatriot six yards out to coolly fire City in front. Manchester City’s 2-2 draw with Burnley meant they missed the chance to close the gap on Chelsea Manchester City’s 2-2 draw with Burnley meant they missed the chance to close the gap on Chelsea Ten minutes later and yet more slick passing involving James Milner and Nasri ended with Brazil holding midfielder Fernandinho placing an accurate shot in off the underside of the crossbar from the edge of the box. Burnley, though, were not without their own moments of promise in the first half, albeit mostly from set plays or on the counter-attack, and when they halved the deficit two minutes after the restart, the whole momentum of the match changed dramatically. The home team will no doubt point to the fact that Burney midfielder Boyd was just fractionally offside when he managed to divert Danny Ings’s cross-cum-shot past City’s stand-in captain Joe Hart. However, it was no more than the Clarets deserved for all their efforts up to that point and despite Tom Heaton in the visitors’ goal needing to pull off an impressive one-handed save to prevent Nasri from making it 3-1 just minutes later, from that point on there appeared only one team likely to score the next goal. That strike duly arrived with just nine minutes left when the ball dropped kindly at the feet of Burnley frontman Barnes in the area after the visitors had launched a free kick high into the City box, before the 25-year-old fired an unstoppable effort high into the top right-hand corner of Hart’s net. Fernandinho was happy to score a superb strike against Burnley, but it was not enough to close the gap on Chelsea Fernandinho was happy to score a superb strike against Burnley, but it was not enough to close the gap on Chelsea And despite Pellegrini throwing Frank Lampard on for the 600th league appaerance of his illustrious club career, not even the veteran goalscoring midfielder could find his adopted club a late winner to close the gap on rivals Chelsea at the top of the table. Soccer Special verdict – Alan McInally \"Everyone who had seen the results at half-time would have thought it was going to finish three or four nil, maybe Burnley get a consolation, but that was not the case. \"City did not start the game very well. Burnley got a little bit of luck when they got back into the game with Boyd being just offside for his goal, but then the whole game changed. Burnley’s whole demeanour changed, and what a shift they put in against the champions. \"No [Vincent] Kompany for City, a real leader, organiser and someone who shouts at the back four constantly. Yes they do still have huge experience at both left and right back, but they were suspect in the middle without Kompany. And no Yaya Toure in the middle of the park is also a problem. Alan McInally says Burnley were good value for their point against champions Manchester City. Alan McInally says Burnley were good value for their point against champions Manchester City. \"They did try and go for it near the end, but it was not a good second half and what a window of opportunity it was for City today. They already know the Chelsea game has finished 1-1, at half-time they are thinking that will do, we are a point behind. \"But it just was not the case and Burnley were excellent and incidentally, they deserved a point for their second-half performance, while Dyche deserves a big pat on the back today.\" Player ratings Man City: Hart (6), Zabaleta (7), Demichelis (7), Mangala (5), Kolarov (7),

holding QPR to a 0-0 stalemate at Loftus Road. With only 24 hours to prepare his team following the sacking of Neil Warnock, Palace caretaker manager Keith Millen named a surprising line-up, with no recognised striker in the starting XI. The first half was a scrappy affair, but it was Millen's side who had the better of the play, and they were only denied by the post after a fine, flowing move. After the break, the R's came into the game, with set pieces their main threat, but the Eagles, who have looked insecure at the back of late, were solid throughout. Crystal Palace caretaker manager Keith Millen insists his only focus is the next game against Aston Villa Crystal Palace caretaker manager Keith Millen insists his only focus is the next game against Aston Villa James McArthur cleared off the line as Harry Redknapp's side posed a real threat from set-pieces, but it was Palace who had the better of the chances in the second period. After such a poor run of results, and with QPR in fine form on their own patch, it was very much a point won by Palace and Millen, whose side remain in the bottom three, with QPR up to 15th. The opening 45 minutes were very scrappy, with the home side guilty of wastefulness in and around the box. Charlie Austin, who has been in fine form, especially at Loftus Road, had the first effort on target, volleying straight at Julian Speroni in the Palace goal after his own cross had not been cleared. Yannick Bolasie then tried an audacious effort from distance, which forced Robert Green to be alert to keep out. The move of the opening period almost led to the deadlock being broken, with McArthur and Joe Ledley exchanging passes to play in Jason Puncheon, who curled an effort past the despairing dive of Green, but could only look on as the ball cannoned back off the post. Leroy Fer twice came close to opening the scoring after the interval, with one volley flying just wide of Speroni’s goal, and another powerful strike from the edge off the box was brilliantly tipped over by the Argentine stopper. Set-pieces were very much the weapon of choice for the R’s, with Austin lurking with intent. Bolasie was a constant danger on the counter attack with his pace and power, but his decision making let him down when it mattered most, and he took one touch too many from numerous good positions. Steven Caulker saw his header was cleared off the line by the retreating McArthur, while Junior Hoillet had another good chance for the hosts, but he got his volley from the edge of the box all wrong, and he sliced wide.

Diouf’s first goal came in the 51st minute, when he was left with too much time and space in the West Brom box, while he barely knew about his second in the 66th minute as Marko Arnautovic’s shot deflected off his legs. The Baggies did have the chance to level at 1-0, but Asmir Begovic and the post prevented Gareth McAuley getting on the scoresheet. Saido Berahino came on during the second half but was unable to trouble the reliable Stoke defence, as Ryan Shawcross and Marc Muniesa marshalled him and Brown Ideye to keep another clean sheet. And at the end of the game, Joleon Lescott and Youssouf Mulumbu were visibly arguing as they made their way off the pitch. West Brom started with captain Chris Brunt, Chris Baird, Graham Dorrans and Brown Ideye, while Berahino was again on the bench. Peter Crouch returned to the Stoke first XI in place of top scorer Jonathan Walters, who was left in reserve. Mark Hughes was pleased with the performance of Mame Biram Diouf Mark Hughes was pleased with the performance of Mame Biram Diouf The visitors started brightly, with their first chance coming within the opening minutes. Ideye broke the offside trap but was unable to keep his shot down. The striker had another chance in the 18th minute, but Begovic got down low to push it out. Baggies skipper Brunt unleashed a swerving strike in the 36th minute that went close but wide, before Stephane Sessegnon also fired off target. Glenn Whelan got a long-range effort on target towards the end of the half that Ben Foster claimed, and Stoke were then relieved to see Craig Gardner loop a shot wide after losing possession in their own half. The game only stayed goalless for six minutes of the second half. Bojan sent the ball out wide, Erik Pieters squared it into the area and Diouf had time to tee himself up before sending his shot flying past Foster to give Stoke the lead. The Potters saw two decent chances to extend their advantage go begging in quick succession soon after, both coming from Diouf crosses. The first came to Crouch, who was just unable to finish at the near post after a challenge diverted the ball wide, and Arnautovic then nodded the next delivery wide. Mame Biram Diouf battles with Andre Wisdom It wasn’t long after that Berahino replaced Sessegnon and West Brom twice nearly levelled when Begovic blocked a Gardner shot and McAuley sent the rebound against the post. Stoke’s second goal, in the 66th minute, showed luck was on their side as Arnautovic’s shot bounced off Diouf’s legs, leaving Foster helpless. Although they did a lot of running in the final 20 minutes, Albion didn’t create any serious chances, which was the story of the game for Alan Irvine’s men, who were holding inquests even before they had left the field of play. Soccer Special verdict – Paul Merson Paul Merson: West Brom should stick by Alan Irvine Paul Merson: West Brom should stick by Alan Irvine “I thought West Brom were very unlucky, especially in the first half. They had a lot of shots outside the box and looked a nervous team; a team down on their luck. They were the better team in the first half, and in the second half both goals were deflections. You can always tell if a team is playing for their manager. If they’re down on their luck and it gets to 2-0 you don’t want it to get to 3-0 or 4-0 or 5-0. That’s when you start thinking the manager has lost it, but it looked like the players were working their socks off for him.” Player Ratings Stoke: Begovic (7); Cameron (7), Shawcross (7), Muniesa (6), Pieters (6); Nzonzi (7), Whelan (7); Diouf (7), Bojan (7), Arnautovic (7); Crouch (6).

Arsenal moved above West Ham in the Premier League after withstanding a strong second-half fightback to win 2-1 at Upton Park. The hosts enjoyed the better of the opening 45 minutes but fell behind shortly before the break when Winston Reid fouled Santi Cazorla in the box and the Spaniard dispatched the subsequent penalty. Danny Welbeck doubled Arsenal’s advantage a couple of minutes later as he tapped in Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain’s cross from a few yards out. Sam Allardyce was angered with the match officials following Alex Song's early disallowed goal. Sam Allardyce was angered with the match officials following Alex Song's early disallowed goal. The Hammers halved the deficit early in the second half as Cheikhou Kouyate headed in his first goal for the club. But despite piling on the pressure they could not grab an equaliser as Enner Valencia headed over the bar in injury time and the Gunners held on for all three points. The win is the perfect end to the year for Arsenal, who largely coped well with the Hammers' physical presence and also looked threatening throughout on the break during an entertaining encounter. Both sides made a number of changes from their Boxing Day outings 48 hours earlier, with Sam Allardyce preferring Diafra Sakho ahead of Valencia and Arsenal replacing the suspended Olivier Giroud with Oxlade-Chamberlain and handing a first start since January 2013 to Francis Coquelin. Former Gunner Alex Song thought he had broken the deadlock early on when he drove in a brilliant volley from 25 yards, only for it to be ruled out for offside. Arsene Wenger believes his side defended well as a team as they took all three points from their trip to West Ham. Arsene Wenger believes his side defended well as a team as they took all three points from their trip to West Ham. It looked to be a harsh decision as no West Ham player touched the ball on its way through a crowd, but the linesman ruled the players in an offside position in front of Wojciech Szczesny were interfering with play. The Hammers were also aggrieved a few minutes later as Sakho went down in the box under a challenge from Mathieu Debuchy and the penalty appeals were waved away. At the other end, a crucial block from Joey O’Brien prevented Alexis Sanchez closing in on goal before the Chilean miscued a header from Cazorla’s free-kick. Andy Carroll served warning of his threat as he easily outmuscled Debuchy as they competed for a high ball, only to then drag his volley well off target. Dangerous The Hammers continued to look dangerous from set pieces and spurned a decent chance to take the lead when James Tomkins wastefully volleyed over the bar from an excellent position. The miss would prove costly as the Gunners then stunned the home side with two goals in as many minutes just before half-time. There was a hint of fortune about the first as the ball ricocheted through kindly for Cazorla, but he was then clearly fouled by Reid inside the box and made no mistake from the penalty spot. That was Arsenal’s first shot on target and they made it 2-0 with their second as Oxlade-Chamberlain combined well with Debuchy down the right and then crossed for Welbeck to tap in. Cheikhou Kouyate jumps highest to pull a goal back against Arsenal. Stewart Downing went close to halving the deficit as he dragged a shot wide from just inside the box before Sanchez saw an effort deflected just wide at the other end. While the home side would have been disappointed to be 2-0 down at the break, it didn’t take them long to get on the scoresheet in the second half. After Per Mertesacker did well to beat Carroll to a header, the ball was lofted back into the box by Tomkins and Kouyate easily rose above Debuchy to head home. The goal was just what the Hammers needed and Sakho was inches away from turning in Kouyate’s cross to equalise moments later. With the Arsenal box under regular bombardment, the visitors’ best moments came on the break, with Adrian pulling off excellent saves to deny both Oxlade-Chamberlain and Sanchez. Welbeck, though, should have put the game to bed when a misplaced pass from Downing gave the England striker a clear run at goal, but he shot over the bar. The Hammers piled on the pressure in the closing stages, with Adrian even going forward for a few set pieces, but Valencia headed their last chance over the bar in the dying stages.

But the hosts got their lead on 51 minutes after Tiote found Perez on the edge of the area, turning before cooly slotting low into the left corner despite being in a confined space. Samuel Eto’o wasted a good opportunity for Everton after being found by Leighton Baines 15 yards from goal, and the visitors were made to pay again. Substitute Ross Barkley failed to control a through ball into the box from Janmaat, gifting it to Colback for the midfielder to push through the legs of Joel Robles for his first Newcastle goal. Kevin Mirallas, another replacement, made it a nervy final six minutes for the hosts, chipping over Alnwick with style after a fine through ball from Baines. And as both sides attacked in the late stages of the match, it was Newcastle who could have made matters safe, Perez hitting the post after a superb driven effort from the edge of the area.

Jamie Redknapp looks at why Chelsea are so difficult to beat following their 2-0 win against West Ham. Chelsea spurned a number of chances to extend their advantage, but Costa eventually made sure of the points on the hour mark when he fired a fine low shot past Adrian. The visitors, who started the day fourth in the table, failed to muster a shot on target and were perhaps fortunate to only lose 2-0, after being second best from start to finish. While the Hammers may well recover from this defeat to challenge for the top four this season, there is no doubt on this evidence that they are some way off the level of Chelsea, who were in irresistible form all afternoon. John Terry says if Chelsea continue their form, it will be tough for anyone to beat them to the title John Terry says if Chelsea continue their form, it will be tough for anyone to beat them to the title Jose Mourinho preferred Oscar over Jon Obi Mikel while the Hammers made three changes from their win over Leicester City, with James Collins, Mark Noble and Enner Valencia all starting. It was Oscar who had the best early opening as Carl Jenkinson let Willian’s ball into the box bounce through for the Brazilian. Jamie Redknapp says Manchester City must be credited for being so close behind Chelsea Jamie Redknapp says Manchester City must be credited for being so close behind Chelsea Fortunately for Jenkinson, his mistake was not punished as Oscar fired over the bar from 10 yards out with just the keeper to beat. Chelsea went close again in the 10th minute as Terry clipped a ball into the box for his fellow centre-back Gary Cahill, who rose well above Jenkinson but could only head over the bar. The Blues were bossing possession and Cahill went close for a second time when he saw a fierce shot from inside the box blocked by Adrian. Willian then tested the Hammers keeper with an effort from 25 yards before Hazard almost got in after some sumptuous one-touch passing. Chelsea’s dominance eventually told on the half-hour mark when Costa headed a corner towards goal and Terry turned it in from a few yards out. Jose Mourinho says Chelsea were very creative with the ball against a difficult defensive West Ham side Jose Mourinho says Chelsea were very creative with the ball against a difficult defensive West Ham side It was almost 2-0 minutes later as Adrian pulled off a fine fingertip save to turn Nemanja Matic’s shot around the post. Costa then went close on a couple of occasions - seeing a deflected effort spin wide and shooting over from Branislav Ivanovic’s cross - as Chelsea continued to completely control the game. The Hammers didn’t manage a shot on target in the first half and they soon found their goal under threat again after the interval as Hazard cut inside and drilled in a shot that Adrian had to palm away. Sam Allardyce sent on Alex Song and Diafra Sakho shortly before the hour mark in a bid to spark his side into life, but Chelsea responded by putting the game to bed in the 62nd minute. Sam Allardyce says West Ham did not play as well as they can, but will take positives from his side not giving up Sam Allardyce says West Ham did not play as well as they can, but will take positives from his side not giving up After a West Ham attack was broken up on the halfway line, Hazard moved the ball forward for Costa, who twisted and turned on the edge of the box before firing an excellent low shot across goal and into the corner. Chelsea looked in the mood for more and came close as Costa volleyed over from Ivanovic’s superb back-post cross and then Adrian tipped Oscar’s free-kick over the bar. As the Blues made late changes, the Hammers almost snatched a consolation effort when Morgan Amalfitano chipped a shot over the dive of Thibaut Courtouis, but saw the ball bounce back off the post. That was to be the visitors' best chance of the match and Allardyce will hope for better from his side when they host Arsenal on Sunday.

The hosts, meanwhile, remain in the relegation zone with defeat but will be encouraged by a very positive display. Both sides named unchanged line-ups, with Brendan Rodgers keeping faith with the 3-4-3 formation that saw them earn a last-ditch point against Arsenal. Burnley, meanwhile, welcomed Sam Vokes back into the squad after a nine-month absence with a cruciate ligament injury. Sean Dyche felt Burnley deserved a lot more from their impressive performance against Liverpool Sean Dyche felt Burnley deserved a lot more from their impressive performance against Liverpool Burnley started the far brighter of the two teams, and Ings almost gave the hosts a deserved lead as he received a throw before spinning on the spot and firing a low effort which hammered back off the near post. Brad Jones was nowhere near the striker’s effort, and it soon became apparent the goalkeeper was not completely comfortable, coming off with a thigh injury moments later to be replaced by the much-scrutinised Simon Mignolet. The hosts continued to press, and Ashley Barnes headed over after setting a sweeping move going, finding Dean Marney out wide before meeting the return ball to put it over the crossbar. Brendan Rodgers felt Liverpool got a massive three points at Burnley and showed plenty of character Brendan Rodgers felt Liverpool got a massive three points at Burnley and showed plenty of character Dyche’s men went close once more 10 minutes before the break as they won a corner, and Arfield met a Liverpool clearance to volley a low effort which just deflected wide off the outstretched foot of Lucas. Both Dean Marney and George Boyd fired efforts over as Burnley tried to make their possession and territory count, but they could not find a way through before the break. Their pressure continued, albeit with less intensity, in the early stages of the second half, but the sucker punch came on 63 minutes as Liverpool moved in front. Philippe Coutinho flicked on Lucas's header forward, and Sterling raced on to the ball beyond the defence, rounding Heaton before firing the ball low into the empty net to give the visitors a surprise lead. The hosts looked dejected and struggled to fashion another decent chance to level matters, as Liverpool started to keep the ball with more authority. Coutinho fired a deflected effort wide inside the final 20 minutes, before substitute Rickie Lambert had the ball in the back of the net with a wonderful first-time shot, but the striker was denied a goal as the flag went up. Burnley continued to press as Vokes was given his first appearance in nine months, but Dyche's men ran out of steam as Liverpool held firm during the latter stages and gave Rodgers a much-needed victory.

First half Burnley were slightly the better side, Danny Ings hit the post, which was their best effort. Second half you expect Burnley to come out all guns blazing and Liverpool to step it up and try to take the game to Burnley but that didn’t happen. Just a long kick out for the goal, flicked on for Coutinho, he hooks it in behind the defence and it was a really good finish Sterling and that was that.

A quick corner on the right caught the Palace defence flat-footed, and Ward-Prowse’s floated cross to the near post was met with a towering header from Alderweireld that had too much power for Speroni to keep out. The Eagles goalkeeper got everything behind a fizzing strike from former Palace defender Nathaniel Clyne, while Dwight Gayle’s downward header at the other end was well blocked by Florin Gardos – making his first Premier League start. The classy Mane skimmed the top of the crossbar with a delightful curling effort from 20 yards before Dann gave the home faithful something to cheer on 85 minutes, heading Jedinak’s superb cross beyond the reach of Forster. The England keeper would not be beaten a second time, clutching a decent effort from James McArthur as Palace raised their game in the closing stages. But Southampton had already done enough to earn their second straight win which reclaimed fourth place in the table ahead of West Ham.

The visitors took the lead in the 38th minute of the Premier League contest when referee Lee Mason adjudged James McCarthy to have fouled Bojan, and the Spanish forward slotted in the resulting spot-kick. Steven Naismith had a header cleared off the Potters' line, Kevin Mirallas passed up a decent-looking chance to equalise and Leighton Baines' drive was parried by Asmir Begovic, but Everton struggled overall to create much against a solid Stoke outfit. In an inconsistent season, the Toffees have now lost three times at home in the league and won only one of their last six top-flight games. Gareth Barry says Everton were made to pay for missed chances and conceding a soft penalty. Gareth Barry says Everton were made to pay for missed chances and conceding a soft penalty. Roberto Martinez's men have slipped a place in the table to 12th, with Stoke - following only their second victory in seven matches - replacing them in 11th. The opening half of the game on a cold, wet day on Merseyside was characterised more than anything else by players hitting the turf. First to go down was Mirallas in the first few seconds, falling under the attentions of Bojan and having his appeals for a penalty waved away by Mason. Romelu Lukaku and Ryan Shawcross then both hit the deck following a nasty-looking, accidental clash of heads. Both were able to continue, although Shawcross sported a head bandage. Mark Hughes felt Stoke got their tactics right at Goodison Park and punished Everton on the break. Mark Hughes felt Stoke got their tactics right at Goodison Park and punished Everton on the break. John Stones - one of three Everton players, along with Mirallas and McCarthy, returning to the team after injury - subsequently required treatment after losing the ball when challenged by Glenn Whelan. The tackle had sparked a Stoke breakaway, but having received the ball from Bojan, Mame Biram Diouf could only fire into Tim Howard's arms. The lively Bojan then just failed to make contact with an attempted header in front of goal, before Phil Jagielka was on the receiving end of a firm Whelan challenge. The England defender was soon down again after jostling with Jonathan Walters in the box and looked hurt, but soldiered on for the time being. Marko Arnautovic was next to be tended to by medical staff after having his ankle stood on by Gareth Barry. Mason kept his cards in his pocket on that occasion, but did not take much longer to make the first booking of the game, cautioning Naismith for a foul on Bojan, who then sent a shot over the bar. The disjointed affair started to find some attacking rhythm as Mirallas saw a shot deflected narrowly wide, Barry meeting the resulting corner at the far post but miscuing things, sending the ball back across goal. Everton manager Roberto Martinez says Stoke should have had Jonathan Walters sent off Everton manager Roberto Martinez says Stoke should have had Jonathan Walters sent off Walters was then yellow-carded for holding back Baines - who had looked to be the last man - and moments later, Mason pointed to the spot at the other end as Bojan went to ground as he tried to get past McCarthy. The Everton midfielder looked amazed by Mason's decision and there were howls of protest from Toffees fans in the stands, but it did not bother Bojan, who finished coolly from the spot. As the first half approached stoppage time - of which 10 minutes were added on - Begovic clumsily gave away a corner and when the ball subsequently came to Naismith, his header was nodded off the line by Steven Nzonzi. A great opportunity then came Mirallas' way in the additional period, but he put his shot the wrong side of the post. Stoke were quick to stifle any advantage that Everton did create as they went in search of their first clean sheet in 13 games. The interval saw Jagielka come off for Antolin Alcaraz, while Howard, who had hobbled down the tunnel after the half-time whistle, was also substituted for Joel Robles. Martinez's side remained unable to show much intensity after the break, as Ross Barkley - who struggled throughout - struck wide and Lukaku shot tamely to Begovic. The Stoke goalkeeper did have to get down to push away a low Baines effort, but there was little to trouble him thereafter, while Nzonzi flashed an effort wide of Robles' goal. There was more tough tackling before the end, though, with Barry being booked for clattering Nzonzi and Potters substitute Charlie Adam receiving the same punishment for bringing down Mirallas. Matthew Le Tissier says Everton just ran out of ideas in their defeat against Stoke Matthew Le Tissier says Everton just ran out of ideas in their defeat against Stoke Soccer Saturday verdict - Matt Le Tissier \"I thought it was a penalty, I felt a bit sorry for McCarthy because Bojan had done him for pace. He came in on the angle, cut back across him and then there was definite contact on the back of his legs, enough to send Bojan off balance and to the floor. Tim Howard went the right way, almost got his fingertips to it but couldn’t keep it out. \"From that moment on Stoke defended really well, they were very well organised, worked tirelessly and on occasions threatened on the counter. Everton looked a little bit clueless, not what I have been used to seeing the last few years. They didn’t seem to have a game plan that was capable of breaking down a very organised Stoke defence.\" PLAYER RATINGS Everton: Howard (6), Coleman (6), Stones (7), Jagielka (6), Baines (7), McCarthy (6), Barry (5), Mirallas (7), Naismith (6), Barkley (6), Lukaku (6).

Harry Kane gave the visitors the perfect start at the King Power Stadium, firing home his 13th goal of the season from Nacer Chadli’s cross to give Spurs the lead after just a minute. However, Leicester fought back well and had their reward just after the break when Leonardo Ulloa tapped home Riyad Mahrez’s cross for his seventh goal of the campaign. The momentum was with the home side but they could not take advantage and it was Eriksen who made them pay, beating Ben Hamer at his near post from a free-kick. Leicester finished strongly as they went in search of an equaliser and they thought they could have had a penalty when Jamie Vardy was brought down by Jan Vertonghen, but it was Spurs who nervously held on for a 2-1 win to take all three points back to north London for the third game in succession. Nigel Pearson made two changes for the home side with Ulloa and David Nugent coming into the attack but it was Spurs who made an immediate impact on the game as they broke for the first time through Erik Lamela. Mauricio Pochettino says Tottenham almost paid the price for becoming complacent against Leicester Mauricio Pochettino says Tottenham almost paid the price for becoming complacent against Leicester The 22-year-old released Chadli down the left into space and he picked out a cross as Kane nipped ahead of Leicester captain Wes Morgan, before firing past Hamer into the bottom right hand corner to give the visitors a flying start. Despite being a goal down, Pearson’s side were enjoying plenty of possession but as has been their problem for most of the season, they were not creating enough to trouble Hugo Lloris. The Frenchman was finally called into action in the 18th minute as Ulloa flicked up the ball and fired a volley goalwards from outside the box which the goalkeeper comfortably tipped over the bar. However, it was Spurs who looked the more likely every time they moved forward and next it was Chadli who tested the keeper. Hamer could only parry the curling shot to Eriksen inside the box, but the Dane’s shot was well blocked. It was all becoming too easy for Spurs but with half-time approaching the home side, spurred on by their fans, came to life and should have scored the equaliser. Excellent work by Danny Drinkwater found Ulloa on the edge of the Spurs penalty area. The Argentine striker skipped past Danny Rose’s challenge and with the goal gaping missed his kick and the ball trickled out for a goal kick. Momentum was certainly now with Leicester as Mahrez forced Lloris into a smart save and then placed a brilliant cross on Ulloa’s head - but with most of the goal to aim at, the former Brighton striker could only hit the right hand post. Nigel Pearson says Leicester must start to make their own luck in both penalty areas Nigel Pearson says Leicester must start to make their own luck in both penalty areas Tottenham should have been out of sight just before the break as Kane rose highest to meet Lamela’s free-kick, but the England U21 international’s header flew wide with the goal at his mercy. Pearson would have been delighted with how his side finished the first half and despite replacing Andy King with Matty James due to injury, he would have wanted more of the same from his side. In contrast, Pochettino would not have been pleased with what he saw towards the end of the first 45 minutes and attempted to shore up his midfield by bring on Ryan Mason for Benjamin Stambouli. However, the move did not work as Leicester responded straight away after more good work from Mahrez. The Algerian international broke free down the right and produced a low cross along the edge of the six yard box. Ulloa used his strength to get in front of Fazio and was on hand to level the scores from close range. Minutes later, Leicester were denied the lead by the woodwork. The impressive Mahrez beat Lloris all ends up with his stunning free-kick but the ball cannoned back off the cross bar. There was nothing coming from Spurs as an attacking force and Pochettino reacted by throwing on Roberto Soldado to partner Kane, however, it was Leicester on the front foot again. This time it was Jeff Schlupp going close and it took a fine fingertip save from Lloris to push his thunderbolt shot around the post. Spurs eventually scored the winner against the run of play with 20 minutes remaining after Kane won a free-kick to the left of the Leicester penalty area. Eriksen seemed to be lining up to put in a cross but the Denmark international whipped in a free-kick which beat Hamer, who should have done better, at his near post. The goal sucked the life out of Leicester and Pearson responded by sending Vardy on with 15 minutes remaining. The change nearly had the desired effect as Vertonghen appeared to bring the forward down in the penalty area. There was no question the Belgium defender got a touch on the ball and there was more contact with the man, but referee Neil Swarbrick waved away the appeal. Their final chance came as the impressive Mahrez sent in another testing cross which Lloris was forced to deal with. The ball fell at the feet of Morgan, but with the goal at his mercy he could not make proper contact and the ball was cleared to safety by Spurs. Phil Thompson says Nigel Pearson must be wondering what he has to do to win another Premier League game Phil Thompson says Nigel Pearson must be wondering what he has to do to win another Premier League game The win means Spurs close the the gap to fourth place to just two points but despite another good Leicester performance, they stay rooted to the bottom of the table after going 13 games without a win in the Premier League. Soccer Saturday verdict - Phil Thompson \"Nigel Pearson will be absolutely gutted. He will be wondering what they have to do to win a match. They have been mugged by a great goal by Eriksen.

The England captain, playing in central midfield, netted a first-half double on Boxing Day and delivered an exquisite pass for Robin van Persie to score United’s third, as Newcastle fell to their fourth defeat in a row in all competitions. Papiss Cisse pulled one back from the spot late on for the visitors but Alan Pardew will rue the fact his side were not awarded a penalty when the game was goalless, as the Magpies slipped to 10th in the top flight. However, Pardew's fragile defence - which has now conceded 12 goals in their last four outings - was opened up with ease by a Manchester United side which has won seven of their last eight matches and sit 10 points adrift of Premier League leaders Chelsea. Wayne Rooney: Celebrates scoring Manchester United's opener The hosts had won their last 10 Boxing Day fixtures going into the contest and Rooney came close to putting them ahead with just three minutes on the clock when he headed Juan Mata’s chipped through ball goalwards, but was ruled offside. Newcastle then showed their threat on the counter-attack when 17-year-old Adam Armstrong - making his first Premier League start - outmuscled Jonny Evans and hooked a cross in for Ayoze Perez, who was unable to connect with a scissor kick. And just moments later, the visitors could have been awarded a penalty kick when Mata clipped the heels of Yoan Gouffran as he burst into the box, but referee Mike Jones waved away Newcastle's appeals. Van Persie headed home Rooney's pass for United's third Robin van Persie responded for the hosts, firing Rooney’s lofted pass into the side-netting after beating the offside trap, but Newcastle continued to pose problems and Daryl Janmaat drew a fine save from David de Gea from 25 yards out. However, it was Manchester United who made the decisive breakthrough on 23 minutes, when Radamel Falcao met Mata’s deep cross and squared for Rooney, who had surged forward from his central midfield role to convert a simple finish from six yards. Falcao should have doubled the advantage moments later when he glanced Ashley Young’s superb in-swinging cross wide of the far post but Rooney was on target again with 36 minutes on the clock to put the Old Trafford outfit in complete control. Falcao’s fierce tackle on Armstrong won the ball back and Mata slipped a simple pass through to the on-rushing and unmarked Rooney, who clipped in his eighth of the season from 12 yards. Moussa Sissoko fired straight at De Gea from long range as Newcastle attempted to strike back, but the home side went in at the break with a comfortable cushion and extended their lead just eight minutes after the re-start. Again Rooney was involved, lofting an inch-perfect pass into the penalty box for the loosely-marked Van Persie to head into the corner for Manchester United's third and his fifth in his last six Premier League appearances. Paul Walsh felt Ashley Young made a big difference to Manchester United against Newcastle Paul Walsh felt Ashley Young made a big difference to Manchester United against Newcastle The Dutchman then looked set to add a fourth on 56 minutes but Newcastle scrambled the ball away, before Armstrong fired a half-volley wide from the edge of the box after Colback's free-kick had been half-cleared by Rooney. Louis van Gaal's men were in full control of proceedings by the hour mark, though, and Jak Alnwick had to parry away a Rooney shot from the edge of the box after neat work from Van Persie and Falcao, before Rooney landed a 25-yard free-kick on the roof of the Newcastle net and Van Persie mistimed a right-foot volley from 10 yards out. Pardew threw Papiss Cisse and Remy Cabella on in search of a lifeline and Perez nearly pulled one back on 79 minutes after skipping past Paddy McNair, but was unable to beat De Gea at his near post from a tight angle. Manchester United looked on course to register their fourth clean sheet in five home games but Phil Jones carelessly stuck out a leg and tripped Colback in the box late on, allowing Cisse to fire a superb penalty into the top corner on 86 minutes. The goal failed to spark a grandstand finish from Newcastle, though, and Van Gaal’s side saw out the remainder of the match to continue their excellent run of results. Soccer Saturday verdict - Paul Walsh \"That was probably the best game I have seen Ashley Young have for a long time. He created so many opportunities for Man United, he was excellent. He has got his mojo back, he has that sharpness, that energy about him. The quality of his crosses, right foot or left foot, they are creating chances and making a difference. If you are Van Gaal you are thinking he is one of the first guys on the team sheet. He has to keep that level, if he does there is no doubt he can push for an England spot.\" PLAYER RATINGS Man Utd: De Gea (7), Evans (7), Jones (6), McNair (6), Carrick (7), Mata (8), Rooney (9), Valencia (6), Young (7), Falcao (7), Van Persie (7).

Adam Johnson had given the hosts the perfect start on Boxing Day, scoring in the opening 30 seconds, but goals from Gaston Ramirez on the half hour mark, James Chester five minutes into the second half and Nikica Jelavic at the death saw the Tigers take all three points. Johnson carried on from where he had left off, following Sunday’s last-minute Tyne-Wear derby winner, pouncing on Curtis Davies’ weak back pass, jostling with the centre-back for possession and then rounding Allan McGregor to give the hosts the lead inside a minute. Johnson featured heavily in an opening period in which Sunderland might have increased their lead with 16 minutes gone, had Liam Rosenior not managed to get a block on Sebastian Larsson's goal-bound shot. Steve Bruce felt his Hull side deserved their victory after fighting back from an awful start at Sunderland. Steve Bruce felt his Hull side deserved their victory after fighting back from an awful start at Sunderland. The Black Cats enjoyed the majority of possession and dominated the opening period of the game but were pegged back when Ramirez's shot from 20 yards skipped over a horrified Costel Pantilimon in the Sunderland goal. Poyet's men came close to restoring their advantage during a flurry of activity at the end of the half with Alex Bruce and Stephen Quinn fortunate to survive appeals for handball in the area before Sebastian Larsson had a header cleared off the line. McGregor then beat away a near-post shot from defender Santiago Vergini in stoppage time to ensure the sides entered the break level. Sunderland were unable to start the second half as they had the first and it was Hull who would take an early lead. With the Black Cats untidy during the opening minutes of the second half, Robbie Brady tested Pantilimon with a 50th-minute free-kick which was turned away for a corner. Sunderland manager Gus Poyet felt some big decisions influenced their defeat against Hull City. Sunderland manager Gus Poyet felt some big decisions influenced their defeat against Hull City. Ramirez delivered the resulting set-piece to the near post and Chester got in front of Vergini to power a header into the top corner. Sone Aluko spurned a great chance when he shot tamely into Pantilimon’s hands and it was left to substitute Jelavic to seal the win. With the hosts pushing for an equaliser in the closing stages, the Tigers broke through Ahmed Elmohamdy who fed the ball into the path of the Croatian who guided a low shot under the keeper to hand Hull their league first win since October and move them out of the bottom three.

The only goal of the game arrived in the 13th minute when Jores Okore felled Jefferson Montero on the edge of the area. Iceland international Sigurdsson stepped up to bend his right-footer over the wall and past Brad Guzan for his 50th goal in English football. Lukasz Fabianski was forced into two high-quality saves in stoppage time to deny Christian Benteke and then Gabby Agbonlahor from snatching a share of the spoils for Villa. Villa will consider themselves hugely unlucky not to return home to the Midlands with at least a point. Heavy morning rain had left surface water on the Liberty pitch but Swansea soon settled into their customary passing game to build early momentum. Gary Monk says his Swansea team were magnificent in difficult conditions and won the battle against Villa Gary Monk says his Swansea team were magnificent in difficult conditions and won the battle against Villa Although he was conceding several inches to Alan Hutton, Montero climbed above the Villa defender at the far post to head Nathan Dyer's cross over and the lively Ecuadorian was the man Swansea looked to cause problems in the opening exchanges. But Villa looked to spring quickly and Agbonlahor, cleared to play after the first red card of his career against Manchester United was rescinded by the Football Association on Tuesday, almost profited from a slick counter-attack. Aly Cissokho's cross was aimed for the head of Benteke but Neil Taylor intervened and the ball fell enticingly for Agbonlahor, whose 25-yard effort fizzed wide of the post. Villa were struggling to contain Montero and his mazy run saw him leave Hutton and Fabian Delph in his wake before he was upended on the edge of the area by Jores Okore. Sigurdsson had scored a free-kick special to defeat Arsenal last month - his previous Premier League goal - and he repeated the feat with a sweet strike over the Villa wall and past Brad Guzan into the top corner of the net for his third league goal of the campaign. But Swansea's momentum was slowed when Montero had to be helped from the pitch and the winger was seemingly in tears as he left the action. Villa manager Paul Lambert took plenty of positives from their performance, despite their 1-0 defeat Villa manager Paul Lambert took plenty of positives from their performance, despite their 1-0 defeat Montero's exit gave the visitors belief they could back into the game and Jonjo Shelvey was booked for stopping Agbonlahor leading a Villa break-out before Tom Cleverley's cross caused anxiety in the Swansea defence. Benteke looked favourite to reach the centre and when it cleared the Belgian's head, Cissokho was unable to collect at the far post with the Swansea defence stretched. Villa's best chance of an increasingly even first half arrived after 33 minutes when Benteke sent a 25-yard free-kick inches wide with Swansea goalkeeper Fabianski rooted to the spot. Benteke then headed Delph's free-kick wide close to half-time and Villa boss Paul Lambert changed formation at the break, with Andreas Weimann replacing Cissokho and playing four at the back. Villa were getting men higher up the pitch into the box but the delivery was often below-par. Swansea manager Garry Monk probably wanted some greater control and he responded to some pinball inside his side's penalty area by introducing Tom Carroll at the expense of Shelvey. But Villa were growing in stature and Weimann wriggled through after a tidy passing movement, although his shot lacked power and Fabianski saved comfortably. Weimann then surged past Williams and Federico Fernandez but his cut-back was poor and straight into the arms of Fabianski with eager Villa forwards waiting in the centre. The home crowd were worried but Ki Sung-yueng was put clean through in the 66th minute after a one-two with Sigurdsson, but the South Korean wasted the opportunity badly. Dyer could have put the issue beyond doubt in the final 10 minutes but Swansea were left to cling on and in the end thank their goalkeeper for victory.

Jose Mourinho’s men went six points clear before this game kicked off with a 2-0 win over West Ham on Boxing Day but City responded in emphatic style and had the game sewn up by half-time with three goals in the opening 34 minutes. A Ben Foster mistake handed Fernando a late Christmas present with just four minutes gone before Yaya Toure doubled the lead from the penalty spot on 13 minutes. West Brom had their chances but David Silva's 34th-minute goal gave City a lead that the hosts could not overturn. Brown Ideye netted a scrappy late goal but it was nothing more than a consolation for the hosts. Manuel Pellegrin says it was vital for City to start the busy festive period with a victory Manuel Pellegrin says it was vital for City to start the busy festive period with a victory West Brom came into this game with just one win from their last seven matches and their nerves were clear from the start as City took the lead inside four minutes. Christmas may have passed but West Brom’s goalkeeper Foster still was giving out gifts by spilling a routine cross right under the nose of Fernando six yards from goal. The City midfielder needed no second invitation and cleverly hooked the ball into the unguarded net. Things went from bad to worse for the hosts in front of a restless home crowd when Joleon Lescott, who endured a nightmare game against his former club, fouled Silva as he jinked his way into the penalty area. From the spot, Toure confidently stroked the penalty into the corner of Foster’s net. Despite being two goals down with just 14 minutes on the clock, West Brom responded well and Saido Berahino went close to reducing the deficit two minutes later but fired wide after being played through by James Morrison. Silva made the West Brom forward pay for that miss on 34 minutes when he got the goal his performance merited. Alan Irvine felt the goals West Brom conceded against Manchester City were self-inflicted Alan Irvine felt the goals West Brom conceded against Manchester City were self-inflicted Lescott squandered possession to Fernando on the half-way line and City broke at lightning speed. Jesus Navas, under no pressure from a West Brom defender, drove his way into the area before squaring the ball to Silva, who had all the time in the world to cleverly pick out the far corner with a precise finish. The only thing that looked likely to threaten a City victory was the snowstorm that engulfed The Hawthorns in the second half. As soon as the whistle was blown for the restart, the snow began to fall and did not relent for the remainder. Conditions became tricky as the snow began to settle and the game suffered in quality as a consequence but referee Mike Clattenburg never looked like considering an abandonment to the dismay of the home crowd who were chanting 'let it snow'. West Brom had the better of the play in the conditions but some wayward finishing by Sessegnon and a missed header from three yards out from Lescott failed to give West Brom a base to launch a comeback. Speaking after Chelsea's win over West Ham, Jamie Redknapp says Manchester City deserve credit Speaking after Chelsea's win over West Ham, Jamie Redknapp says Manchester City deserve credit Ideye did find the net late on for the hosts - his first goal for the club since his £10m move from Dynamo Kiev - but it was hardly one to remember as Joe Hart flapped at a cross and the ball bounced off the back of the forward’s head and into the net.

Sanchez saw an early penalty saved by Rob Green, but the Arsenal star got the better of the Englishman later on in the half, heading past him from eight yards for the opener. Olivier Giroud was sent off after the break for a headbutt on Nedum Onuoha, but the 10 men got a second through Rosicky, slotting past Green after good work from Sanchez. Charlie Austin’s penalty halved the deficit with 11 minutes remaining after Mathieu Debuchy’s trailing leg brought down Junior Hoilett, but Arsenal held on to return to sixth place in the Premier League. Sanchez battles with QPR defender Armand Traore The result means QPR have now lost nine consecutive Premier League away games, equalling a top-flight record in the process. Arsenal were under pressure even before kick-off after four of the five teams above them at the start of the day picked up wins, putting Arsene Wenger’s side down in eighth. But they started on the front foot, winning a penalty after eight minutes after former Gunner Armand Traore brought down Sanchez as the winger moved away from goal. Sanchez dusted himself off to take the spot kick, but Green guessed correctly and dived down to his left to bat away the tame effort. Rob Green saves a tame penalty from Sanchez early on QPR kept out the hosts for most of the half thanks to Steven Caulker and Rio Ferdinand, both thwarting Giroud in dangerous areas, before the Frenchman forced a good save out of Green from a free-kick 25 yards out. But Arsenal finally took the lead eight minutes before half-time, breaking the visitors’ resistance. Rosicky, who impressed throughout at the Emirates, combined well with Danny Welbeck and Santi Cazorla before Kieran Gibbs' drilled centre found Sanchez unmarked to head past Green. A minute later, Caulker’s diving header at the other end skidded a yard wide of Wojciech Szczesny’s right-hand post, a warning sign from the visitors. And Arsenal were down to 10 men on 53 minutes, with Giroud headbutting QPR defender Onuoha after complaining that he was pushed in the back as he went in to block Green’s clearance. Olivier Giroud is sent off for a headbutt on Nedum Onuoha Harry Redknapp made two changes shortly after the red card, bringing Hoilett and Leroy Fer on to alter their formation, but their man advantage didn’t tell as the hosts doubled their lead. Having glided between two QPR defenders, Sanchez offloaded the ball to Rosicky on the right-hand side of the penalty area, leaving the midfielder to slot past Green via a slight deflection. Sanchez nearly got his second, curling over from 15 yards, but QPR refused to back down as they found a way back into the game. Substitute Hoilett advanced into the area and was brought down by Debuchy, despite replays showing the defender got the slightest of touches on the ball, and Austin smashed the penalty down the middle with confidence for his 12th goal of the season. Hoilett and Niko Krancjar wasted several opportunities late on, but it was Mauricio Isla who came closest to equalising, seeing his goal-bound near-post header from a corner cleared by Mathieu Flamini. And Arsenal held on for all three points, giving Arsene Wenger his 400th Premier League victory and 600th in all competitions.

with 2-0 victory at Stoke Chelsea will be top of the Premier League table on Christmas Day after beating Stoke 2-0 at the Britannia Stadium. Chelsea were in front with just two minutes on the clock at the Britannia Stadium on Monday night when John Terry rose highest to force home a Cesc Fabregas corner. Stoke threatened briefly in the second period but Fabregas sealed victory for the visitors with 13 minutes left. John Terry speaks to MNF after scoring the first in Chelsea's 2-0 win at Stoke John Terry speaks to MNF after scoring the first in Chelsea's 2-0 win at Stoke The result means Jose Mourinho's men pull three points clear of Manchester City. Stoke had already dished out beatings to Arsenal and Man City this season, but were dealt a major blow inside two minutes as Terry gave Chelsea the lead. Fabregas whipped a dangerous corner from the right into the danger area and the Chelsea skipper determinedly out-jumped his marker Geoff Cameron to power a header into the net. Terry has now scored 35 top-flight goals and is Chelsea’s joint 10th top scorer in the history of the Premier League. Mourinho: More than three points Mourinho: More than three points The early goal silenced the home crowd as the visitors confidently stroked the ball around midfield, with Eden Hazard causing real problems on the left flank. Phil Bardsley took matters into his own hands on 20 minutes and received a booking for a wild lunge on Hazard by the touchline that visibly enraged Chelsea boss Mourinho on the sidelines. The booking seemed to spark the hosts into life and Steven N’Zonzi forced Thibaut Courtois into a save after his 20-yard shot took a deflection. Tough win pleases Matic Tough win pleases Matic Diego Costa always looked a threat on the break for Chelsea and he should have doubled the lead on 31 minutes when sent clear by Nemanja Matic, but he dragged his shot wide of the upright. Substitute Charlie Adam injected plenty of life into the Stoke midfield when he was introduced in the second half and he missed a great chance to level the game on 71 minutes. Usually so clinical with his left foot, Adam skewed a shot wide of the post from 20 yards after the ball had broken to him very kindly on the edge of the area. Hughes: We gave it a go Hughes: We gave it a go It was a missed chance that proved costly for the hosts as Fabregas wrapped up the points on 77 minutes. The brilliant Hazard picked out the former Barcelona man with a fine pass inside the area and two touches later, the ball was in the net. It may not have been Fabregas' most clinical strike, but his rather scuffed effort wrong-footed Asmir Begovic and the ball trickled into the far corner. Costa should have got his name on the scoresheet when he was released by Andre Schurrle with six minutes left but Begovic did well to deny the striker. The night was soured slightly for the league leaders when Hazard had to be replaced in injury time by Kurt Zouma after suffering a kick on his heel from Jon Walters, but Chelsea saw the job through with ease.

Newcastle as Adam Johnson's last-gasp strike at St James' Park sealed a 1-0 victory. Johnson rounded off a fine Sunderland counter-attack, which he had initiated himself, following a Newcastle corner in the final minute. Adam Johnson says he couldn't ask for anything more after scoring a late winner for Sunderland Adam Johnson says he couldn't ask for anything more after scoring a late winner for Sunderland The former England winger drilled substitute Will Buckley's knock-back past third-choice Toon keeper Jak Alnwick to send the travelling fans delirious when it appeared the spoils were destined to be shared. The counter came less than a minute after Costel Pantilimon acrobatically denied Moussa Sissoko's fierce 30-yard drive. Steven Fletcher and Connor Wickham came close to opening the scoring in an opening half where Newcastle began the brighter of the two teams, but the Scot saw his strike hit the bar before Wickham headed wide from a yard out. Ayoze Perez proved to be main threat for visitors in a hotly-contested and, at times, ill-tempered affair on Tyneside. But Johnson's 90th-minute strike sealed the points as Newcastle's dismal form against the Black Cats continued – Sunderland had never won four in a row against their bitter rivals before. Alan Pardew says losing in the last minute is as painful as it gets Alan Pardew says losing in the last minute is as painful as it gets The result moves Sunderland to within four points of their north-east rivals and four points clear of the relegation zone, while Newcastle remain ninth. The game certainly lived up to its pre-match billing as Lee Cattermole set the tone inside the opening 10 seconds with a strong challenge on Daryl Janmaat. Things soon came to boil again as last-minute addition Sebastian Coates, filling for Anthony Reveillere who picked up an injury in the warm-up, and Fabricio Coloccini saw yellow for either side. Newcastle made the brighter start of the two teams but it was Sunderland who had the better of the first half chances. Wickham wasted a glorious opportunity to put the visitors ahead when Johnson's free-kick found him unmarked at the back post, but he somehow headed wide when it looked easier to score. Fletcher then hit the bar after he stretched to connect with Sebastian Larsson’s instinctive pass upfield. Gus Poyet says Sunderland's last-minute winner against Newcastle was a perfect moment Gus Poyet says Sunderland's last-minute winner against Newcastle was a perfect moment After controlling Sissoko’s flick-on, Perez curled a shot just beyond the post for Newcastle in a moment of individual brilliance, but the hosts could not make their larger share of possession count in front of goal. Despite their lack of possession, Sunderland continued to create the clearer openings in the second half. Jordi Gomez missed the game’s clearest opportunity to break to deadlock as he failed to hit the target from 10 yards out after a Black Cats counter. The opportunity presented itself for Gomez while Newcastle were temporarily down to 10 men following defender Steven Taylor’s horrid face-first collision with the post as he made a desperate clearance to prevent Fletcher from heading into an open net. Taylor returned minutes later patched up – much to the delight of the home faithful – and it seemed to inspire Newcastle who built some momentum as they pursued an opener. Gus Poyet celebrates Adam Johnson's goal Perez forced a fingertip save from Pantilimon with a curler, and then Sissoko broke upfield for the fifth time in the game, narrowly missing Sammy Ameobi’s drilled cross into the area. Pantilimon then produced a wonder save to seemingly ensure the game ended goalless – tipping Sissoko’s drive over the bar. But less than a minute later Sunderland broke through Johnson who, after finding Fletcher on the left, headed towards goal. Fletcher found substitute Buckley inside the box and he laid the ball into the path of Johnson, who blasted home to seal an historic win for Gus Poyet’s men.

Adam Lallana believes Liverpool were the dominant team throughout their 2-2 draw with Arsenal Adam Lallana believes Liverpool were the dominant team throughout their 2-2 draw with Arsenal Philippe Coutinho gave Liverpool the lead after a quiet opening, driving low into the corner from 20 yards, before Mathieu Debuchy’s far-post header handed Arsenal an unlikely leveller just a minute later in first-half stoppage time. Arsenal took the lead on 64 minutes, Olivier Giroud picking up the ball after a one-two with Santi Cazorla to sweep home from six yards. Liverpool substitute Fabio Borini was sent off late on for picking up two bookings in the space of four minutes, before the 10 men earned a point with Skrtel's late header from a corner. Liverpool ended their weekend nine points off fourth, while Arsenal are sixth in the Premier League, four points off the Champions League places. Brendan Rodgers is confident Liverpool are on the right track Brendan Rodgers is confident Liverpool are on the right track Liverpool dominated possession in the opening 45 minutes, but for all their endeavour only seriously tested Wojciech Szczesny once before going ahead. Arsenal, who were 4-0 down in 20 minutes during February’s 5-1 defeat at Anfield, struggled to reach second gear, turning over possession in dangerous positions for both Adam Lallana and Coutinho to exploit. Lazar Markovic had the game’s first chance, receiving a ball from Steven Gerrard on the corner of the area before shaking off Danny Welbeck and Debuchy only for Szczesny to thwart the Serb from six yards. Arsene Wenger says the 2-2 draw was a fair result Arsene Wenger says the 2-2 draw was a fair result Markovic then lashed over from 20 yards after being put clear by Raheem Sterling, but the hosts were deservedly one up on 45 minutes. Giroud tamely gave the ball away in the final third to Jordan Henderson, who offloaded to Coutinho in space, before the Brazilian finished clinically off the post from just outside the area past the outstretched hand of Szczesny. But just a minute later Arsenal were level. Alexis Sanchez’s set-piece delivery was headed clear by former Gunners defender Kolo Toure, only for Mathieu Flamini to head back across the box to the lurking Debuchy, who got above Skrtel to head home. Olivier Giroud celebrates Arsenal's second goal with Danny Welbeck Flamini arguably should have been off the pitch five minutes earlier after the Frenchman’s flailing arm caught Lallana in midfield, but referee Michael Oliver did not deem it a second bookable offence. Gerrard’s low stooping header from Sterling’s cross went just over after the break, before the visitors took an unlikely lead. After great play on the left from Kieran Gibbs, Giroud exchanged passes with Cazorla before slotting into the net through the legs of Brad Jones in the Liverpool net from close range. Liverpool’s Lucas Leiva lashed over in a good position later on, before substitute Borini forced a good stop from Szczesny after finding space to head goalwards. Martin Skrtel's head had been bandaged in the second half, causing nine minutes to be added on Borini was first booked for throwing the ball away in frustration at a decision by Oliver, and four minutes later the Italian scraped his boot across Cazorla’s chest for a second yellow. Then, with 97 minutes on the clock after a six-minute stoppage for a head injury on Skrtel, the Slovakian defender himself popped up from Lallana’s corner to direct a powerful header past Szczesny.

goals from David Silva and Yaya Toure sunk Crystal Palace 3-0 at the Etihad Stadium. City, playing without a striker, missed a host of chances during the first half but the Premier League champions' dominance eventually paid off as Silva helped himself to two second-half goals before Toure rounded things off with 10 minutes to go. David Silva celebrates scoring Man City's second goal James McArthur had a header wrongly ruled out for offside for the visitors midway through the second half but in truth Manuel Pellegrini’s side ran out comfortable winners as they searched for a fourth goal to send them top of the league on goal difference. They did not find the goal they needed to top the table outright but the champions sent out a warning in the title race as they stretched their winning run to eight matches in all competitions, one short of equalling a club record. Pellegrini started the afternoon fielding a team without a recognised striker after injuries ruled out regular trio Sergio Aguero, Stevan Jovetic and Edin Dzeko. James Milner was used as an emergency striker with Silva and Samir Nasri providing support to the England international. Joel Ward is closed down by David Silva Palace made two changes, with Jason Puncheon and Fraizer Campbell coming in for Wilfried Zaha and the injured Marouane Chamakh, and it was the Eagles who made a positive start at the Etihad. Neil Warnock’s side forced an early corner which Joe Hart, fresh from signing a new five-year deal, needed to punch clear in commanding fashion. Just minutes later City produced their first chance of the match after an intricate passing move released Pablo Zabaleta down the right, but Nasri could not convert the full-back’s cut back. Yannick Bolasie shoots into the side-netting Pellegrini’s men were starting to tighten their grip on the game with Fernandinho and Nasri going close with long-range efforts, however the visitors looked dangerous on the break through the speedy Yannick Bolasie. In the 15th minute, the DR Congo international breezed past Zabaleta and once again Hart was forced into action, the England No 1’s parry falling to safety. Hart was called on again minutes later as he beat away another corner at the near post with Eagles skipper Mile Jedinak poised to pounce. Warnock’s side were now enjoying their best period of the game and they were inches from taking the lead when Campbell beat the offside trap, but his acrobatic over-head kick drifted just wide of the post. Joe Hart barks instructions at his defence The home side responded with chances of their own and Nasri was the man looking most likely to unlock the well-drilled Palace back four. The Frenchman produced a direct run into the penalty area before playing in Silva but the Spaniard poked his shot wide. Next it was Toure with a shot – after a brilliant one-two with Aleksandar Kolarov – but once again he failed to test Julian Speroni. Half chances fell to both Campbell and Bolasie as the visitors continued to trouble the City defence but the majority of possession was with the home side and they nearly made it tell just before the break. Pablo Zabaleta fails to score from close range Toure, who was starting to have more influence on the game, produced an inch-perfect through ball as Zabaleta timed his run to perfection, but with the goal gaping his lobbed finish shaved the outside of the post. City continued to press forward in search of the opener through their other full-back but Milner failed to make proper contact with Kolarov’s dangerous cross, allowing Joel Ward to clear the danger. Whatever Pellegrini said to his side at the interval worked as they came out with renewed attacking vigour and it paid dividends straight away as Fernandinho found Zabaleta on another storming run and the Argentine’s clever pass was fired into the net by Silva after a deflection. Joe Hart makes a save from Crystal Palace's Mile Jedinak The goal was no more than the home side deserved and they could have quickly doubled their advantage, but Toure’s powerful shot flew high over the bar. Palace were hanging on and Jesus Navas was next to test the visitors’ defence, driving past two defenders before putting in a testing early cross, but with Milner poaching at the front post Scott Dann cleared the danger. It was all City and they made their dominance count. This time it was the other full-back causing problems as Kolarov’s cross from the by-line found Silva, who pulled away from his marker to produce a tidy left-foot finish from six yards to score his second of the afternoon. Yaya Toure scores Manchester City's third Palace, who threw on Zaha for Campbell in the 67th minute, thought they grabbed a foothold back in the match and it was the lively Bolaise who was at the heart of it as his cross found McArthur, who beat Hart with a powerful header. But the flag wrongly went up with Fernandinho playing the midfielder onside. It was certainly a huge let-off for City, who replaced two-goal hero Silva with Frank Lampard, but the result was never really in doubt and all three points were secured with 10 minutes remaining when Toure finished a fast counter-attack with a thumping finish, beating Speroni at his near post. The win means City pile the pressure on Chelsea and move level on 39 points with Jose Mourinho’s side, who play Stoke City on Monday Night Football.

Louis van Gaal felt Manchester United were the better side at Villa Park but lacked aggression Louis van Gaal felt Manchester United were the better side at Villa Park but lacked aggression Christian Benteke put Villa ahead after 18 minutes at Villa Park, curling home superbly from just inside the area after escaping the attention of Jonny Evans. Radamel Falcao pulled United level after the break, getting in behind Ciaran Clark to head past Brad Guzan from Ashley Young’s superb left wing cross. Gabriel Agbonlahor was sent off for Villa in the 65th minute, going in hard on his former team-mate Young in a 50-50 challenge and catching the United man on the ankle. But Villa held on for a point, and even had a few chances of their own late on through Leandro Bacuna and Benteke. Paul Lambert says his Villa side played some excellent football in their 1-1 draw Paul Lambert says his Villa side played some excellent football in their 1-1 draw For all their possession in the opening 45 minutes, United could only create half chances as Villa’s defence worked tirelessly to snuff them out. Looking to keep up with Chelsea and Manchester City at the top of the Premier League, the away side went with Falcao up front alongside Robin van Persie. Early on, former Villa midfielder Young’s low ball into the box evaded the home defence as well as Van Persie, while the Dutchman’s volley from a fine Wayne Rooney diagonal pass was saved well by Guzan in the Villa net. Villa took the lead after Fabian Delph’s deep free-kick from the left fell to Benteke deep inside the box. The Belgian shook off United defender Evans, twisting one way and then the other, before his left-footed effort through a packed penalty area left David de Gea helpless. Radamel Falcao celebrates his equalising goal for Manchester United But United kept pressing and Falcao, put through by Van Persie inside the penalty area, couldn’t escape the pressure of Villa defender Jores Okore, seeing his tame shot fall into the arms of Guzan. In a half of few chances, Delph saw his effort blocked well by Evans inside the area while Young, continuously given plenty of time on the ball by Villa right-back Matt Lowton, saw his delivery come to nothing on numerous occasions in the first half. The game came to life again in the second-half; first Benteke offloaded to Delph in space, whose effort was blocked by Evans, before Benteke’s rising header from the resulting corner was tipped over by De Gea. United players walk away dejected after going 1-0 down after 18 minutes At the other end Guzan did superbly well to prevent Van Persie equalising after the Dutchman was put through one-on-one with the American stopper, but United did draw level on 53 minutes. Young got more joy down the left, getting the better of Lowton to provide a perfect cross for Falcao, who headed back across the goal and past Guzan. It was the Falcao’s second goal for United since joining on loan from Monaco in the summer, but no chances came the Colombian’s way thereafter. Aston Villa players surround the referee after he sent off Gabriel Agbonlahor Agonblahor was then dismissed in controversial fashion, swinging his leg into a challenge with Young near the centre circle, with referee Lee Mason deeming it to be dangerous play. It was Villa’s second red card in as many games. United forced two good saves out of Guzan after having the extra man, but it was the hosts who continued to press. Substitute Bacuna went close with a 25-yard effort which sailed just over De Gea’s goal and in injury time Bacuna’s low cross into the box evaded Charles N’Zogbia after United had committed men forward. And Villa held on for a credible draw when defeat looked more likely, while United dropped seven points behind second-place Manchester City, who beat Crystal Palace earlier on Saturday. Soccer Saturday verdict – Matt Le Tissier Matt Le Tissier believes Aston Villa were unfortunate to go down to 10 men Matt Le Tissier believes Aston Villa were unfortunate to go down to 10 men “Villa will consider themselves unfortunate in terms of going down to 10 men, but not in terms of the game itself. United dominated the possession and had the majority of the chances. They will feel disappointed they didn’t take all three points, but you have to give credit to Aston Villa, especially when they went down to 10 men. There was 25 minutes to go at that point and they dug in really well, defended for their lives and showed a little bit of attacking intent on the break.” Player ratings"},{"date": "20/12/2015",

only goal with Jonjo Shelvey and Bafi Gomis Hull City continued their winless home run as they lost 1-0 to a much-changed Swansea at the KC Stadium. Garry Monk made seven changes for Saturday's Premier League clash, but his side quickly found themselves in the lead when Jonjo Shelvey's 14th-minute shot was deflected off Ki Sung-yueng and wrong-footed Allan McGregor. While that represented a slice of luck, it was no less than the visitors deserved. Shelvey hit the post with a second long-range effort and Bafetimbi Gomis was also denied by the woodwork in the latter stages. Steve Bruce's Tigers, struggling with injury and suspension and second from bottom in the table, also hit the frame of the goal through Andy Robertson and had a last-gasp penalty appeal rejected but would have been flattered by a point. Hull manager Steve Bruce admitted his side simply were not good enough in their defeat to Swansea City Hull manager Steve Bruce admitted his side simply were not good enough in their defeat to Swansea City Since beating Crystal Palace at the start of October they have failed to win in 10 Premier League matches, collecting just four points from a possible 30. With Jake Livermore earning a fifth booking of the season and captain Curtis Davies coming off injured in the second half, things already appear bleak for the Boxing Day trip to Sunderland. The Swansea teamsheet appeared to give hope to the hosts, with top-scorer Wilfried Bony starting on the bench and Gylfi Sigurdsson, Leon Britton and Jefferson Montero all absent through injury. But the Tigers had troubles of their own to contend with, replacing the suspended Tom Huddlestone with Gaston Ramirez and the injured Michael Dawson with Alex Bruce. Ashley Richards of Swansea goes up for a header with Nikica Jelavic of Hull The game began vibrantly, Abel Hernandez hurling himself into tackles before Nikica Jelavic and Wayne Routledge wasted early chances at either end. James Chester was caught out by Ashley Williams' long ball, but Routledge pulled his shot wide of the near post. Ramirez also spurned a good chance, sending a wayward first-time effort into the stand after Neil Taylor diverted the ball into his path. The game did not have the look of a stalemate and the opener came in the 14th minute, Shelvey neatly creating room to shoot on his left foot. McGregor had it well covered but was left helpless as Ki's unwitting intervention saw the ball change course and bobble over the line. Jake Livermore tackles Jonjo Shelvey Hull were close to the ideal response eight minutes later, Robertson initiating a break down the left then reappearing in the box to collect Hernandez's lay-off. The Scotland international let rip but was denied by the crossbar and a fingertip save from Lukasz Fabianksi. That was as good as Hull's first-half efforts got, as passes began to go astray and Livermore collected his fifth booking of the season and a one-game suspension to go with it. Swansea came within a whisker of doubling their lead when Shelvey tried his luck from distance a second time. The midfielder took three touches without being closed down, with his fourth a fizzing effort off the outside of his right boot. McGregor was well beaten but the ball crashed off the post and came back across goal. Swansea manager Gary Monk felt his resolute back four were the key to victory at the KC Stadium Swansea manager Gary Monk felt his resolute back four were the key to victory at the KC Stadium Hull had a couple of chances after the break, Ramirez's free-kick briefly threatening before bending wide and Jelavic's header saved low by Fabianksi. But the pursuit of an equaliser almost cost them dear in the 54th minute when David Meyler carelessly lost the ball with Hull committed in attack. A lightning break ended with Tom Carroll threading a pass through Davies' legs and into the path of the unmarked Shelvey, who looked certain to score from eight yards. But McGregor threw himself forward and smothered the shot brilliantly with his feet. Bruce swapped a defender for an attacker on the hour – son Alex off for Sone Aluko – but the latter's first contribution was to go in the book for a sloppy foul on Taylor. Swansea failed once again to put the game to bed when Gomis got a slight touch on Marvin Emnes' cross in the 74th minute and watched as the ball wrong-footed everyone before nestling against the post. Davies hobbled off before the close, with Harry Maguire handed a Premier League debut, while Yannick Sagbo tumbled under pressure from Angel Rangel in the dying seconds. Soccer Saturday verdict – Paul Merson Paul Merson was left uninspired by Hull's performance in their 1-0 defeat to Swansea Paul Merson was left uninspired by Hull's performance in their 1-0 defeat to Swansea “I think Steve Bruce is a good manager and I don’t think there’s a need to panic. I am worried about Hull. They had 11 attempts and three on target – but I can’t remember any of them. I never once got out my seat excited and that was the worrying thing for me. Playing at home they didn’t get the fans off their seats, which will probably be a worry. They haven’t got a goalscorer and they haven’t got a player who is going to create something special.” Hull: McGregor (7), Bruce (6), Chester (6), Davies (6), Meyler (6), Hernandez (7), Livermore (7), Jelavic (7), Ramirezn (6), Robertson (7), Elmohamady (6).

QPR had a penalty appeal waved away minutes later when Barton went flying in the box under a Morrison challenge as he went to latch onto an Austin knock-down. QPR manager Harry Redknapp says Charlie Austin's goalscoring form is all down to his great attitude to the game QPR manager Harry Redknapp says Charlie Austin's goalscoring form is all down to his great attitude to the game Austin could have grabbed his hat-trick with 11 minutes remaining but was denied by Foster after substitute Junior Hoilett had dashed down the right and delivered a teasing cross. But the match ball would be his for keeps just six minutes later as he completed the comeback for the hosts. A superb Barton corner was met powerfully by the striker, who rose above Pocognoli to score his first Premier League hat-trick. There was still time for West Brom substitute Saido Berahino to strike the crossbar in injury time as his side pushed Foster into the attack from a flurry of corners. However, QPR stood firm and the win moves them out of the relegation zone – level on points with West Brom in 15th place. Soccer Saturday verdict – Phil Thompson Phil Thompson believes QPR would be lost without Charlie Austin Phil Thompson believes QPR would be lost without Charlie Austin \"It wasn’t a game of high quality, but excitement was there all the time. There were chances at either end. West Brom started so fast and thoroughly deserved to be 2-0 up. The big thing for QPR is the home form and they were 2-0 down against a team that will be around them in the table. Would that demoralise them? It didn’t! They showed absolutely fantastic character to come back. Charlie Austin is a great story – it’s 11 Premier League goals for him now.\" Player Ratings QPR: Green (7), Onouha (6), Caulker (6), Dunne (6), Suk-Young (5), Vargas (7), Henry (6), Barton (7), Fer (6), Zamora (6), Austin (9).

The home side were not at their fluent best but picked up their first league points since November 24 courtesy of a Romelu Lukaku own goal, Graziano Pelle's 12th of the season and a Maya Yoshida header. Harrison Reed says he did not expect to start against Everton and was glad he could help Saints to victory Harrison Reed says he did not expect to start against Everton and was glad he could help Saints to victory The win keeps Southampton fifth while Roberto Martinez's inconsistent side remain 10th after an insipid display that rarely tested Saints goalkeeper Fraser Forster. Everton began well, perhaps seeking to exploit any home nerves following their poor run of form, but failed to fashion a chance while on top – Jose Fonte's brilliant challenge denying Steven Naismith a clear shot at goal. And as Saints slowly warmed to their task, Sylvain Distin was lucky to avoid a booking – or even conceding a foul – for seemingly hauling down Shane Long on the break, while Pelle headed Nathaniel Clyne's cross over from 10 yards to serve warning of the home side's growing confidence. Ronald Koeman was delighted to put an end to Southampton's run of five defeats Ronald Koeman was delighted to put an end to Southampton's run of five defeats Pelle did have the ball in the back of the net midway through the half – the referee's whistle cutting short any celebrations after a foul in the build up – and the home fans were then screaming for a penalty when Long beat Phil Jagielka to a high ball and then tumbled under the England defender's clumsy challenge. Justice was served from the resulting corner though as James Ward-Prowse's inswinger was knocked into his own net from close range by Lukaku to continue a run of three consecutive own goals by Everton at St Mary's. And it might have been two a couple of minutes later as Long and Ryan Bertrand combined well down the left, but Pelle could only poke the resulting cross the wrong side of the post. Clyne's cross then fell just behind the on-rushing Ward-Prowse as Saints ended the half in the ascendancy. Roberto Martinez says it was a disappointing afternoon after Everton were defeated 3-0 by Southampton. Roberto Martinez says it was a disappointing afternoon after Everton were defeated 3-0 by Southampton. Everton's response after the break was to up their intensity, but they could find no way through a resilient Southampton defence superbly marshalled by Fonte – resorting to long-range potshots that rarely beat the first man. At the other end, Southampton were happy to be a threat on the break and Distin was at full stretch to cut out Bertrand's cross before Pelle grabbed the home side's second in the 65th minute. With little room to manouevre, Clyne did brilliantly to dig out a cross from the right and Long's knock-down fell to the Italian, who poked past Tim Howard from eight yards. Fonte then met another immaculate Ward-Prowse delivery with a stooping header that Howard did well to parry away in a crowded area, before Forster was finally forced into meaningful action with a full-stretch save to tip over Lukaku's 25-yard drive. But any hope of an Everton revival was ended eight minutes from time as Sean Davis' impudent cross with the outside of his boot was met by Yoshida, who ghosted between the two centre-halves to head home and complete the win.

I’d say 3-0 maybe flatters them a little touch because Everton were in the game for long periods without really troubling Fraser Forster too often. It was down to really good defending today.

A superb first Premier League goal from Erik Lamela helped Tottenham Hotspur cap off an excellent week with a 2-1 victory over Burnley at White Hart Lane. Mauricio Pochettino praised Erik Lamela's 'great' goal against Burnley Mauricio Pochettino praised Erik Lamela's 'great' goal against Burnley Spurs, who thrashed Newcastle United 4-0 in the Capital One Cup quarter-finals in midweek, took the lead after 21 minutes when Harry Kane headed home his first home league goal. Burnley levelled five minutes later thanks to a brilliant strike from Ashley Barnes that flew into the top corner. But Lamela restored Spurs’ lead with an even better effort after 35 minutes when he curled a wonderful shot into the far corner and out of Tom Heaton’s reach. Spurs survived a nervy second half with their one-goal lead intact to win only their fourth home league game of the season and move above Arsenal and up to sixth in the table. It was the perfect end to a good week for Spurs, who won at Swansea last weekend before sweeping aside Newcastle to reach the semi-finals of the League Cup. They only made one change from their victory at the Liberty Stadium, with Nacer Chadli starting in place of Roberto Soldado. Burnley manager Sean Dyche says that he's pleased to see his team adjusting to life in the Premier League Burnley manager Sean Dyche says that he's pleased to see his team adjusting to life in the Premier League Burnley were unchanged from the side that beat Southampton last time out and they could have taken the lead inside two minutes as Kieran Trippier picked out Scott Arfield with a back-post cross, but he failed to hit the target on the half volley. Spurs also threatened during a lively start to the match as Kane went for goal on a couple of occasions and Ryan Mason missed the target from the edge of the box. When the breakthrough did arrive after 21 minutes it was thanks to some quick thinking from Christian Eriksen. The Dane was a few yards offside when a quick free-kick was played through to him so opted to leave the ball for Chadli, who beat a defender and then crossed for Kane to head home from close range. It was Kane’s first Premier League goal at White Hart Lane but it was quickly overshadowed as Barnes levelled with a stunning strike five minutes later, collecting George Boyd’s pass and firing an unstoppable shot into the top corner. Harry Kane is tackled by Dean Marney. Kane should have quickly restored Spurs’ lead but failed to make contact with the ball from Lamela’s pull back with the goal at his mercy. Jason Shackell then headed wide at the other end when he should have hit the target before Lamela made it 2-1 with a wonderful effort. Cutting in from the right he picked his spot in the far corner and curled a superb shot beyond the dive of Heaton. Mason went close to making it 3-1 as he fired over the bar, but the midfielder then had to be taken off before half-time with an injury and was replaced by Benjamin Stambouli. After the break Burnley almost equalised immediately as Danny Ings twice went close in a matter of minutes. The England Under-21 international saw a near-post shot saved by Lloris after beating Fazio for pace and then was denied again by the keeper from the subsequent corner. Burnley continued to look the livelier side as Spurs struggled to ease their fans’ nerves with a third goal. Ashley Barnes celebrates scoring a superb equaliser. It took them until the final 10 minutes to create any clear openings but even then crosses from Kyle Walker and Eriksen didn’t find a team-mate. Fortunately for the home side their defence largely kept Ings and Barnes quiet and Lloris was only called upon to save a late free-kick from substitute Ross Wallace.

Nigel Pearson says his Leicester players keep spoiling their good performances with sloppy errors Nigel Pearson says his Leicester players keep spoiling their good performances with sloppy errors Carroll capitalised on Paul Konchesky's backpass midway through the first half to hand the hosts the lead just moments after he missed a glorious opportunity to break the deadlock.

The hosts set about imposing their physical and, at times, aerial game on the visitors from the offset.

Stewart Downing celebrates scoring West Ham's second Carroll was unable to connect with an acrobatic effort early in the second half and there was a moment of alarm when he appeared to jar his ankle and knee in an innocuous incident before he crashed into the advertisement hoarding and a photographer or two. But Carroll brushed himself down and was involved in the game's deciding goal. As West Ham reverted back to the classic route-one play, the striker made a nusciance of himself in the Leicester ranks and allowed Sakho to flick the ball into the path of Downing, who curled home an excellent astrike to all but seal the points. Nugent and Ulloa were denied by Adrian at point-blank range late on as Leicester rallied. Had either header gone in it would have set up a grandstand finsh, but as it was the Hammers eased to victory.

Ross Barkley capped off an inspired half with a superb individual strike on 33 minutes which sparked the game into life after an uneventful opening half hour on Merseyside. Kevin Mirallas doubled the hosts’ advantage two minutes before the break as he curled a heavily-deflected free-kick off Eduardo Vargas and past Rob Green. Barkley continued his influential performance in the second half and was involved in Everton’s third as Steven Naismith headed past Green in the Rangers goal to extend his side’s lead within 10 minutes of the restart. Jamie Carragher and Gary Neville discuss the contribution of Everton's Ross Barkley Jamie Carragher and Gary Neville discuss the contribution of Everton's Ross Barkley Rangers lacked a real presence up front for the majority of the opening hour, prompting Harry Redknapp to bring Bobby Zamora on. And having given his side a bit more bite up front the striker reduced the deficit 10 minutes before full-time, converting from close range after Tim Howard had parried Jordon Mutch’s shot. That, coupled with a nasty-looking injury to Mirallas in the closing minutes, was the only bad note on what was otherwise a great performance from Roberto Martinez’s side as they leapfrogged Liverpool into 10th in the Premier League, while QPR’s eighth consecutive away defeat leaves them in the bottom three, a point adrift of Burnley. QPR had arguably made the brighter start, with Matt Phillips guiding a tricky volley just over the bar and Junior Hoilett shooting straight at Tim Howard. The home fans were unhappy with the hosts' slow start but saw signs of the sort of play Goodison Park has become accustomed to in the 26th minute when Coleman broke down the right and crossed for Naismith, whose shot was inadvertently blocked by Romelu Lukaku. Everton goalscorers Steven Naismith and Ross Barkley give their reaction Everton goalscorers Steven Naismith and Ross Barkley give their reaction And seven minutes later the hosts took the lead through a moment of individual brilliance. Barkley picked up the ball by the halfway line and drove forward before unleashing a shot that arrowed into the top corner via a slight deflection off Mauricio Isla. And just 10 mintues later they doubled their lead after Joey Barton gave away a free-kick for catching Naismith with a trailing elbow and, from the resulting free-kick, Mirallas' shot deflected off Vargas and beyond Green. Vargas had enough time to get a deliberate touch but he could not have directed the ball into a worse position as far as his team and 'keeper were concerned. Everton were buoyed by their lead and almost managed a third before half-time, but this time Aiden McGeady's curling effort was just past the far post. Harry Redknapp praises his QPR side's performance despite going down 3-1 to Everton Harry Redknapp praises his QPR side's performance despite going down 3-1 to Everton QPR had never recovered from a two-goal half-time deficit in the Premier League and they showed no sign of achieving that once the second 45 got underway. The opening moments of the second half saw Mirallas appeal for a penalty after Richard Dunne put his arm across the Belgian but with contact appearing minimal referee Neil Swarbick waved the claims away. But the pressure soon told as the Toffees capitalised on a misplaced clearance from Green in the 53rd minute. Mirallas played in McGeady on the right and his cross found Naismith in yards of space to head the ball in despite the efforts of Nedum Onuoha and Dunne on the line. Roberto Martinez praises Ross Barkley after he shone in a deeper midfield role Roberto Martinez praises Ross Barkley after he shone in a deeper midfield role With that, Redknapp introduced Zamora and, with Everton appearing to ease off the gas, Rangers had some prolonged joy for the first time in the game. In the 80th minute Howard could only parry Mutch's shot straight to Zamora, the striker duly converted from six yards to reduce the arrears and bag his first goal of the season. The home fans were becoming frustrated as the game meandered to its conclusion, a conclusion which had a sour ending for the hosts as Mirallas was carried off after Mutch's poor challenge. The Belgian turned his ankle under the tackle from Mutch and appeared to be in some discomfort when he was carried from the field and replaced from Arouna Kone. The Ivorian made his second appearance since returning from injury himself and his first league appearance in a year. And Kone almost turned provider after he slipped Samuel Eto’o in in the closing stages but the veteran striker's effort struck the post just moments before the full-time whistle.

performance as Manchester United extended their winning run in the Premier League to six games with a 3-0 victory over Liverpool at Old Trafford. First-half goals from Wayne Rooney and Juan Mata and a third after the break from Robin van Persie saw Louis van Gaal’s side consolidate third in the table and close to within five points of second-placed Manchester City. Watch the Super Sunday analysis of De Gea's display Watch the Super Sunday analysis of De Gea's display However, their defensive frailties were all too apparent throughout the game and they were hugely indebted to De Gea, who produced no fewer than six excellent saves in a superb performance. Liverpool had little trouble creating chances against United’s porous back three, but defensive errors of their own and a mistake from the officials for Mata’s goal ensured they remain ninth in the table, seven points adrift of the top four. Brendan Rodgers saw plenty of positives for his Liverpool team but admits they need to cut out the mistakes. Brendan Rodgers saw plenty of positives for his Liverpool team but admits they need to cut out the mistakes. Sterling thwarted Brendan Rodgers's side started with pace and intensity and should have taken the lead when Adam Lallana slipped in Raheem Sterling after 12 minutes, but the England winger saw his low left-footed shot saved by the alert De Gea. United immediately went down the other end and scored through Rooney, who side-footed home from the edge of the penalty area after Antonio Valencia eased past Joe Allen on the right wing and cut the ball back beautifully. The goal settled the hosts down and they enjoyed more possession, yet it was Liverpool who continued to create the better opportunities. After Steven Gerrard had seen a right-foot strike from distance deflected into the arms of De Gea, the Spanish goalkeeper produced another point-blank save after 23 minutes to once again deny Sterling, who had skipped past a static Phil Jones in the left channel. David de Gea put in a Man of the Match performance to help Manchester United to a 3-0 victory over rivals Liverpool at Old Trafford. David de Gea put in a Man of the Match performance to help Manchester United to a 3-0 victory over rivals Liverpool at Old Trafford. The visitors were then made to pay for their profligacy when Mata doubled the lead by nodding home unmarked at the back post on 40 minutes, although they were not helped by the officials failing to spot that Van Persie had flicked Ashley Young’s left-wing cross on to the Spaniard, rendering him a couple of yards offside. Liverpool started quickly once again in the second half and should have been level within six minutes. However, Jordan Henderson sent a free header in the box inexplicably over, before De Gea produced yet another superb piece of goalkeeping to block a low shot from Sterling, who had pounced on a tame backpass from Ashley Young and was through one-on-one. Balotelli disbelief Louis van Gaal feels there is more to come from his Manchester United team Louis van Gaal feels there is more to come from his Manchester United team But De Gea’s best save was kept for half-time substitute Mario Balotelli, who looked stunned when he saw the United goalkeeper tip his goalbound shot on to the crossbar after 67 minutes. Liverpool appeared buoyed by the chances they were being afforded, but all belief then drained out of them when Van Persie added United’s third after 71 minutes. Dejan Lovren made a horrible mess of clearing Rooney’s cross and presented the ball straight to Mata, who could have shot but instead spread the ball right for the unmarked Dutchman to side-foot home. De Gea’s virtuoso display was not yet over, though, because he denied Balotelli twice more, first clawing a low shot out of the bottom corner eight minutes from time and then blocking the disbelieving striker’s effort when through one on one five minutes later.

If there was anyone the home side would have wanted bearing down on goal in the 23rd minute it would have been the in-form striker, but just as the Ivorian was about to pull the trigger on Jefferson Montero’s through-ball former Swansea star Ben Davies recovered brilliantly to make a last-ditch tackle. The home side were piling on the pressure now in what was becoming a feisty affair in South Wales – both Ryan Mason and Jan Vertonghen were booked for visitors – and once again it was Kane and Bony at the heart of the action. First, Kane tried to drag his side forward with a mazy run into the Swansea area. The 21-year-old went to ground with his side claiming a penalty, but referee Robert Madley was on hand to wave away the Spurs appeal. Then, after brilliant passing between Sigurdsson and Angel Rangel, the Spanish full-back was released into space down the right. His 43rd minute cross found Bony in space but his goal-bound shot was blocked by Fazio. Harry Kane and Christian Eriksen scored Tottenham's goals Harry Kane and Christian Eriksen scored Tottenham's goals Spurs were rocking and in desperate need of the half-time break as Routledge made a clever run in behind the Spurs defence but failed to make contact with Neil Taylor’s long pass. The pattern of play after the interval was in much the same vein as the first half and Swansea were finally rewarded for their efforts. It was that man Bony who did the damage. Routledge found plenty of space down the right and had all the time in the world to pick out his man. The Ivorian duly delivered, finally beating Lloris after his first attempt was blocked by Fazio. It was the least the home side deserved and Mauricio Pochettino reacted by bringing on Mousa Dembele for the ineffective Roberto Soldado as his side tried to stem the flow of Swansea’s attack. Ki Sung-yueng was the next to try his luck at Lloris’ goal but the South Korea international could not direct his glancing header on target. Despite all Swansea’s possession, Tottenham did enjoy a decent spell of pressure as first Mason tried his luck from long range and then Kane sent a curling shot inches wide of Gerhard Tremmel’s far post. Garry Monk left stunned after his Swansea failed to make the most of the chances they created against Tottenham Garry Monk left stunned after his Swansea failed to make the most of the chances they created against Tottenham It was end-to-end stuff at the Liberty Stadium as both side’s searched for a winner and Sigurdsson, who was playing against his former club, curled a left-footed shot into the side netting. Heading into the final 20 minutes Swansea regained their foothold on proceedings with substitute Jonjo Shelvey and Montero both going close. But Tottenham finished strong and Kane thought he’d won it for the Pochettino’s men with just over 10 minutes remaining after connecting with another Eriksen corner. This time his header drifted just wide of the far post. Time was running out for both sides to grab a winner but with just a minute remaining of normal time Eriksen picked up Jazz Richards’ poor clearance and fired a powerful strike past Tremmel from the edge of the box to hand the visitors a dramatic victory. The win lifts Spurs up into seventh in the race for the top four and extends their unbeaten record over Swansea in the Premier League.

goal Burnley moved out of the Premier League relegation zone after Ashley Barnes’ second-half strike handed the hosts a 1-0 victory against Southampton. However, goalkeeper Tom Heaton was arguably the hero for the home side after he saved Dusan Tadic’s penalty on the hour mark. Burnley manager Sean Dyche says he is very happy with his side Burnley manager Sean Dyche says he is very happy with his side Burnley went on to capitalise with 17 minutes to go as a defensive horror show from Southampton, who are on a run of four straight league defeats, allowed Barnes to ghost in unmarked and the 25-year-old’s deflected shot beat Fraser Forster at his near post. Sean Dyche’s men worked tirelessly to hold on to their advantage in the closing stages and it was to be their day as they picked up their first Premier League win in December to move one point clear of the relegation zone. Dyche resisted the temptation to make unnecessary changes after his side lost to relegation rivals QPR last Saturday and the move paid dividends as Burnley looked to make amends right from the first whistle. Danny Ings was clearly fired up for the clash against his former club and saw an early sight of goal after good work from George Boyd down the Burnley right, but the England Under-21 striker could not direct his header on target. Southampton manager Ronald Koeman is frustrated that his side didn't take their chances Southampton manager Ronald Koeman is frustrated that his side didn't take their chances Just minutes later, the 22-year-old was driving at the heart of the visitors’ defence again and this time he had Forster scrambling, but his powerful drive crept inches past the post. Burnley were starting to pile on the pressure and were having plenty of joy down the right as Kieran Trippier sent in two dangerous crosses which Jose Fonte and Nathaniel Clyne had to deal with. Midway through the first half, Southampton started to find their passing range, but James Hesketh, on his first senior start, and Ryan Bertrand could not trouble Heaton in the Burnley goal. The visitors were forced into a change when Hesketh could not shake of a knock after a challenge from Michael Keane, but substitute James Ward-Prowse nearly made an immediate impact with a 25-yard shot, but Heaton was once again up to the challenge. After the break, Burnley started the brighter of the two sides. Trippier continued to cause the Saints' back four plenty of problems with his crossing ability and Scott Arfield was the beneficiary as he climbed highest at the far post, but his header bounced of Clyne and away from danger. But it was Southampton who responded and produced their best moment of the match as Tadic and Graziano Pelle combined to release Sadio Mane just inside the penalty area, but the Senagalese winger failed to hit the target. The pressure was starting to build on the home side and they appeared to buckle when Boyd brought down Ryan Bertrand in the penalty area. Dusan Tadic reacts after having his penalty saved by Burnley's Tom Heaton Clattenburg had no hesitation in pointing to the spot and up stepped Tadic, but Heaton, who saved two of the six penalties he faced last season, was up to the task, diving low to his left to tip the shot round the post. The save spurred Burnley back into life as Ings tested Forster with a stinging drive from long range, but it was to be a mistake from Clyne that proved to be Ronald Koeman’s side’s undoing. In the 73rd minute, the England full-back lost possession deep in his own half, with the ball falling into the path of Barnes, whose deflected shot was enough to beat Forster at his near post. Southampton pushed forward for an equaliser right to the final whistle but Burnley’s work rate never dropped, with Ings and Barnes putting the visitors under constant pressure. Koeman threw on Shane Long with just over 10 minutes remaining. Fonte had the best chance from Ward-Prowse’s free-kick, but his header was directed straight at Heaton. Southampton’s final chance came in the dying seconds through Victor Wanyama, but the midfielder could not direct his free header on target as Burnley moved up to 17th in the table with their third win of the season.

Hazard scored in the early minutes and set up Diego Costa for Chelsea's second goal just after the hour, a goal that came not long after Tom Huddlestone had been sent off in a game that frequently threatened to boil over. Jose Mourinho doubts Gary Cahill is the type of player to dive Jose Mourinho doubts Gary Cahill is the type of player to dive Hull's players were upset with referee Chris Foy on more than one occasion, but he had little option but to dismiss Huddlestone for a nasty challenge that ended any chance the visitors had of taking advantage of a Chelsea display that rarely reached a level above subdued when it was 11-a-side. Chelsea, beaten by Newcastle last weekend to end their unbeaten start to the season, were keen to get Branislav Ivanovic involved down the right flank in the early minutes, but it was a move down the left that cut a swathe through Hull’s defence for the seventh-minute opener. Jon Obi Mikel and the impressive Nemanja Matic worked hard to win the ball in midfield and the latter fed Oscar, whose cross was perfectly placed between two static Hull defenders for Hazard to head past Allan McGregor. Referee Chris Foy shows a red card to Hull's Tom Huddlestone after a challenge on Filipe Luis Hull lost Michael Dawson soon after to an apparent hamstring injury, but they grew into the game and Sone Aluko fired over the bar with their first decent chance after Mikel had lost the ball cheaply. Brave defending from James Chester denied Costa a chance and Gary Cahill headed way over the bar as Chelsea tried to grab hold of the game back after a quiet spell. Cahill was lucky to escape more serious censure than a yellow card after going in over the top on Aluko, with Nikica Jelavic only able to hit the Chelsea wall with the resulting free-kick from a dangerous spot. Hull started the second period brightly, with the Blues still strangely subdued going forward, and Jake Livermore was not far off target with a snap-shot from just outside the box. Dismissed Visiting players were again surrounding Foy on 52 minutes when Cahill appeared to take a dive in the box – his claims for a penalty were waved away but there were no further sanctions taken against the England centre-half. Eden Hazard took great delight in a rare headed goal that set Chelsea on their way to victory Eden Hazard took great delight in a rare headed goal that set Chelsea on their way to victory The tetchiness continued as Alex Bruce was booked for a foul on Willian, and what seemed an inevitable sending-off arrived just before the hour when Huddlestone went in late on Filipe Luis and was rightly dismissed for what eventually turned into a stamp on the Spaniard's ankle. Chelsea were soon on the front foot and made it 2-0 on 68 minutes, with Hazard at the centre of things again as he linked up with Ivanovic and then played a cute through-ball for Costa to fire across McGregor into the net.

Any attacking instinct Hull had before the dismissal disappeared after it, and Chelsea were happy to play the ball around, with Jose Mourinho bringing on Andre Schurrle, Didier Drogba and Ramires for a run-out off the bench.

McArthur gave the home side the lead in the 11th minute with his first goal for the Londoners after Yannick Bolasie used his pace to beat Phil Bardsley down the left, before sending a cross into the box for the Scot to head past Asmir Begovic. But Crouch quickly levelled for the visitors. Bojan’s cut-back from the byline was met by Jonathan Walters and when his shot came off a home defender, it fell perfectly for the former England international to tap it home. The draw leaves Palace only one point above the relegation zone after just one win in 10 games, while Stoke remain in 11th. The distinct lack of rhythm will worry both managers, with the away side also left to sweat on the fitness of star forward Bojan, who hobbled off early in the second half. James McArthur left frustrated after draw James McArthur left frustrated after draw Neil Warnock might be hankering after a goal-poacher in the January transfer window, but leaving Marouane Chamakh up front alone hardly proved conducive to widespread threat. Bolasie, Wilfried Zaha and McArthur were tasked with rushing forward to join the lone front man - fine in theory, but too often Palace lacked the killer option. Warnock's system cried out for the attacking midfield trio to race beyond Chamakh whenever he dropped off to link play. That happened just once in the opening hour and brought McArthur's goal. A turgid first half yielded just two chances, both converted, but beyond that quality was only conspicuous by its absence. The sprightly Bolasie laid on a neat cross for McArthur to flick a back header over Begovic to hand the hosts the lead. McArthur redirected the ball with as much neck as head, hence the reasonably sheepish celebration. Stoke goalkeeper Asmir Begovic is happy with a point against Crystal Palace after making several crucial saves. Stoke goalkeeper Asmir Begovic is happy with a point against Crystal Palace after making several crucial saves. Stoke's immediate riposte fooled the crowd into expecting lift-off. Crouch tapped in Walters' deflected shot to level, only for the battle to deflate once more. The malaise continued after half-time, and injury to Stoke's only creative outlet, Bojan, only made things worse. The longer Stoke failed to fire, the more the home side passed over repeated invitations to steal victory. With no clear chances after the break, neither side merited the three points. Soccer Saturday verdict – Paul Merson Paul Merson full of praise for Crystal Palace's pacy threat Paul Merson full of praise for Crystal Palace's pacy threat “It was a very even game and there was nothing in it. It wasn’t really Bojan’s day. He was involved in the goal with a great bit of skill, but he didn’t really get into it. Palace were just about the better team, but at the same time Stoke were comfortable. As the game went on it fizzled out and it reminded me of a European first-leg game where nobody wants to lose the game and they’re both happy with what they had.” Player ratings"},{"date":

goal of the game at Leicester Manchester City remain three points behind leaders Chelsea after Frank Lampard’s 175th Premier League goal earned them a hard-fought 1-0 win at bottom side Leicester. While City will be delighted with three more vital points, the injuries are mounting up for Manuel Pellegrini’s men; both Edin Dzeko and Vincent Kompany picked up knocks. There was a blow for City before the match had even started as Dzeko picked up an injury during the warm-up and had to be replaced in the line-up by Jose Pozo. Frank Lampard scored to draw level with Thierry Henry in fourth place on the all-time Premier League goalscoring list Frank Lampard scored to draw level with Thierry Henry in fourth place on the all-time Premier League goalscoring list City then squandered the first good opportunity to open the scoring when Eliaquim Mangala met a free-kick at the back post but put his header across the face of the goal-mouth. Mangala then did well at the other end, managing to get the ball out for a corner after Jamie Vardy had turned in the box. Leicester more than held their own in the first 20 minutes however, and Esteban Cambiasso went close with a fine free-kick from 30 yards out which was only just wide of the post. But the visitors then began to take charge and Leicester goalkeeper Ben Hamer, starting in place of the injured Kasper Schmeichel, had to catch a Pozo volley after his own weak punch. And Hamer then produced a really good save to keep out a low shot from Yaya Toure after the midfielder had received from David Silva. Nigel Pearson found plenty to be positive about despite defeat to champions Man City Nigel Pearson found plenty to be positive about despite defeat to champions Man City Breakthrough City then got the breakthrough five minutes before half-time when Samir Nasri did brilliantly, advancing down the left-hand side of the area before sending over a low cross which Lampard adroitly turned into the net from the edge of the six-yard box. Toure then scuffed a shot wide from the edge of the area and Leicester made it through to half-time without any further concessions. The hosts strove for a breakthrough at the start of the second half and a free-kick bounced dangerously around in the City box before Vardy’s touch let him down when he looked to be in on goal in a subsequent attack. The lively Nasri tried to tee up Silva at the other end but his cross took a slight deflection which caught out the Spaniard and the ball bounced off his leg and out for a goal-kick. Leicester then had half-hearted penalty appeals waved away when Mangala challenged Vardy in the box, and the Foxes brought Leonardo Ulloa off the bench to try and give them more of a threat up front. City seemed to be more than content with 1-0 and both Nasri and goalkeeper Joe Hart were booked for delaying the action. And there was yet more bad news for City on the injury front as captain Kompany limped off with 15 minutes left on his return to action, apparently with a hamstring problem. Desperate for something from the game, Leicester made a chance with 10 minutes left but Ulloa’s goal-bound shot was blocked by a City defender after good play from Riyad Mahrez. Toure shot high and wide from a tricky angle at the other end, substitute Jesus Navas then volleyed over as City counter-attacked after a Leicester free-kick was blocked and Hamer got down well to save a low Nasri effort. Leicester struggled to create clear-cut chances despite pumping some balls into the City area as the minutes ticked down, Ulloa volleying a late half-chance over the bar as they made it 10 Premier League games without a win. Nigel Pearson’s men are now three points adrift at the bottom of the standings, while City will be grateful to loanee Lampard, who is now level with Thierry Henry in fourth place in the list of Premier League goalscorers.

Maybe they were looking at the young lad up front and thinking, ‘We can’t knock any long balls to him’, and there was not really anything that threatened Leicester City. They must have been quite happy and there were very few chances in the game until the goal. “Leicester had good energy, which you expect from every team, but not enough quality to break down a team like Manchester City, who were in second gear, particularly in the final third.” Player ratings Leicester: Hamer (7), Konchesky (7), Simpson (6), Morgan (6), Wasilewski (6), Cambiasso (7), Drinkwater (5), King (5), Mahrez (7), Schlupp (5), Vardy (6).

Gus Poyet was left frustrated with Sunderland’s inability to find a winner in their 1-1 draw with West Ham. Jozy Altidore missed a superb chance for Sunderland just before half-time and Andy Carroll fired centimetres wide in the 90th minute for West Ham as both teams spurned fine opportunities to claim victory. The result sees West Ham remain fourth in the table, level on points with third-placed Manchester United, while Sunderland stay 15th after their fifth draw in six games. Sluggish Sunderland West Ham made the more potent start and could have been out of sight inside 10 minutes. Carl Jenkinson and Diafra Sakho both had point-blank shots saved by Costel Pantilimon from promising positions inside the area, and then Carroll should have done better than head over from 15 yards after a superb cross from Downing. The hosts looked toothless in attack and equally susceptible to the counter, with Downing on the left, Sakho on the right and Carroll through the middle all threatening to overwhelm the Sunderland back line. Adam Johnson won Sunderland a penalty after contact from James Tomkins However, down the other end, Adam Johnson was proving just as a dangerous and when he ran at an exposed James Tomkins in the right channel, the slightest of contact was enough for him to go down and referee Phil Dowd gave a penalty, much to the disgust of an irate Allardyce. Gomez converted comfortably, but it was only a brief lead for Sunderland, whose defenders inexplicably allowed Downing to shoot left-footed from the edge of the area eight minutes later. The strike needed a deflection to defeat Pantilimon and find the bottom corner, but it was nevertheless a well-deserved equaliser. Sakho had a fine chance to give West Ham the lead after another direct ball down the right cut hapless Sunderland left-back Anthony Reveillere out of the game, but once again the Senegal striker couldn’t capitalise and pulled his shot wide. Fluffed lines Sakho's miss was made to look forgivable on the stroke of half-time when Altidore – six yards out and unmarked - inexplicably failed to make contact with a low Sebastian Larsson cross. Stewart Downing and James Tomkins pleased with point at Sunderland Stewart Downing and James Tomkins pleased with point at Sunderland Sunderland improved markedly after the break, but it was still West Ham who enjoyed the better chances and Aaron Cresswell saw a low shot stopped by Pantilimon after a deft pass from Downing. The visitors’ shot tally continued to rise, with Carroll chipping narrowly over after a latching on to a loose ball 10 yards out, before Winston Reid found the roof of the net with a looping header. Sunderland manager Gus Poyet responded by sending on Steven Fletcher for the ineffective Altidore, and the Scot almost repaid him with a rasping left-foot shot that Adrian in the West Ham goal did well to save. The game was now wide open and Connor Wickham thought he had stolen victory for the hosts with a shot that was tipped narrowly over, but the best chance fell to Carroll, whose low right-footer on the cusp of injury time flew just the wrong side of the post.

Charlie Nicholas believes Gus Poyet will be the happier of the two managers after Sunderland's 1-1 draw with West Ham. “Gus Poyet might be the happier manager. I think Sam Allardyce will be pretty agitated to have the penalty given against him. As the game wore on he ended up having a little bit of a chuckle with the referee and by the time it was level it was obviously easier for him. West Ham didn’t get too many decisions given to them, but it was a half-decent game. It lacked a bit of quality and a bit of drive at times, but West Ham were more ambitious.

Craig Gardner’s first Premier League goal in over a year gave West Brom a much-needed 1-0 victory over 10-man Aston Villa at The Hawthorns. The visitors were up against it after just 21 minutes when Kieran Richardson was shown a straight red card for a studs-up tackle on Stephane Sessegnon. The dismissal forced Villa on to the back foot and their resistance was finally broken in the 72nd minute following the introduction of Saido Berahino. Just minutes after coming on, Berahino put in a dangerous cross from the right that Brad Guzan couldn’t clear and the ball fell for Gardner - a former Villa player and Birmingham City fan - to fire home. Christian Benteke wasted Villa's best chance to equalise in the dying stages when he shot wide, but in the end it was a deserved and important victory for West Brom. Mike Dean shows Kieran Richardson a straight red card for his tackle on Stephane Sessegnon. Certainly the importance of Gardner's goal was clear on the touchline as Baggies boss Alan Irvine pumped his fists in celebration at the strike. Irvine has been under pressure in recent weeks following the disappointing run but was positive with his team selection as he handed starts to Silvestre Varela and Brown Ideye. Villa made one enforced change from their win over Leicester City, with the injured Ashley Westwood replaced by Richardson. Neither side offered much of a goal threat in the early stages, although most of West Brom’s best moments came down the left. Sebastien Pocognoli forced Guzan into a save from a tight angle after he stepped inside Alan Hutton, while Valera also beat the full-back but saw his dangerous cross into the six-yard box cleared. Alan Irvine was full of praise for matchwinner Craig Gardner Alan Irvine was full of praise for matchwinner Craig Gardner With 20 minutes gone there looked to be little between the sides, but Richardson then did the Baggies a huge favour when he went lunging in on Sessegnon and was dismissed. The former Baggie was always chasing the ball after a heavy touch and Mike Dean had little choice but to show him a straight red for the studs-up tackle. But the Baggies were unable to make the most of their numerical advantage before the break and didn’t test Guzan until the 41st minute, when Sessegnon had a shot that the keeper saved with his legs. After the interval it was a different story as West Brom dominated possession and started to threaten more regularly. Varela saw a close-range volley blocked before Ideye missed a header and then blazed over the bar from eight yards out when he should have at least hit the target. Craig Gardner praised his West Brom teammates after scoring his first goal for the club Craig Gardner praised his West Brom teammates after scoring his first goal for the club Villa were seeing little of the ball but it looked as though they might hold out until Gardner finally broke the deadlock in the 72nd minute. Berahino, who had only come on a few minutes earlier, put in a dangerous cross from the right that Guzan didn’t deal with properly. The ball fell to Sessegnon and although his shot was blocked, Gardner made no mistake with the follow-up as he fired into the bottom corner. It was no more than West Brom deserved for their second-half dominance, but Villa almost snatched a draw after a couple of late openings. First, Benteke flicked a shot past the far post in the 80th minute, before the Belgian sliced wide from the edge of the area after a knock down from Gabriel Agbonlahor in stoppage time. That was to be the last chance for Villa as the Baggies held on to secure a vital victory.

Alan Pardew says his side were not good enough but caught Arsenal on a good day. Alan Pardew says his side were not good enough but caught Arsenal on a good day. Ayoze Pérez pulled one back for Newcastle on 63 minutes but Cazorla grabbed his second from the penalty spot after Welbeck was fouled by Paul Dummett. Arsenal started at a ferocious tempo and Per Mertesacker, who came in for criticism from Jamie Carragher for his performance in last weekend’s 3-2 defeat at Stoke, came close to opening the scoring when heading a Cazorla corner against the crossbar. The early pressure from the hosts did finally tell on 15 minutes when Giroud and Sanchez linked up to brilliant effect. Olivier Giroud rises highest to score the opening goal. Sanchez found space on the right-flank before delivering a pin-point cross for Giroud, who rose above Daryl Janmaat and hammered a header into the top-corner. Welbeck could have added a second minutes later but his goal from a tight angle was disallowed for a trip on Janmaat. Newcastle had a penalty appeal of their own turned down on the half-hour mark when Welbeck handled the ball in the area before Mike Williamson and Papiss Cisse were both denied by the returning Wojciech Szczesny, who produced two point-blank saves to keep his side in front. It turned out to be a very happy 30th birthday for Cazorla as he grabbed the first of his two goals on 54 minutes. Santi Cazorla celebrates scoring Sanchez was once again the man with the assist as he found the Spaniard with a precise ball in the area. The diminutive midfielder danced through a Fabricio Coloccini challenge and dinked the ball into the far corner. Arsenal continued to press forward at pace with an obvious gameplan to target Dummett down the Newcastle left. That ploy reaped more rewards four minutes later when the impressive Bellerin beat his marker down the flank and sent in a cross that was flicked home at the near post by Giroud, who has now scored six goals in five Premier League appearances against Newcastle. The visitors did briefly threaten when Perez gave his side hope with a clever header that found the net following a Jack Colback centre but any hopes of another famous Toon comeback against Arsenal were dashed as Alan Pardew's men struggled to create clear cut chances. Giroud chose to share his MOM award with Cazorla Giroud chose to share his MOM award with Cazorla It was Arsenal that looked the more likely scorers and after a chorus of “only one Arsene Wenger\" rang around the Emirates, Cazorla grabbed a fourth with two minutes remaining from the penalty spot. Welbeck was fouled by Dummett and Cazorla cheekily chipped the ball home - otherwise known as a “panenka” - to seal a victory that closed the gap between Arsenal and Manchester United in third to just two points.

The visitors took the lead on 11 minutes when Jose Fonte’s sloppy back-pass was seized upon by the Dutchman and he slid the ball past Fraser Forster. Neville: United grind out results Neville: United grind out results Southampton were always the team showing more energy and levelled things up on 31 minutes as Graziano Pelle fired home after Dusan Tadic’s shot deflected into his path. Van Persie's post-match reaction Van Persie's post-match reaction But the hosts could never get their noses in front and paid the price with 19 minutes remaining as Wayne Rooney’s free-kick evaded everyone but Van Persie, who skilfully prodded home from a tight angle. The result moves Louis van Gaal’s men above Southampton - beaten for the third straight game - and into third place in the Premier League. Both sides made two changes from their midweek games, with Maya Yoshida and Sadio Mane coming in for Southampton and fit-again Rooney and Paddy McNair starting for United. Despite making a bright start, Southampton fell behind early on as Van Persie was given an early Christmas present by Saints skipper Fonte. Van Gaal responds to Neville comments Van Gaal responds to Neville comments Under no pressure, the defender played a poor back pass to his goalkeeper Forster and Van Persie was onto it like a shot. The striker composed himself before rolling the ball under the advancing goalkeeper to score his second goal in his last three games. For a team that were on a four-match winning run, United looked short on confidence as Southampton’s game plan of pressing high up the pitch caused the visitors problems and their task was made more difficult when Chris Smalling picked up an injury on 18 minutes and had to be replaced by Jonny Evans. Koeman left to rue mistakes Koeman left to rue mistakes The equaliser came midway through the first half when Marouane Fellaini gave away possession in the middle of the field and the hosts broke down the right-hand side. From a Shane Long cross Tadic showed great composure to control and fire a shot goalwards and although his effort was blocked, Pelle was quickest to react from six yards for his first goal since October. The leveller gave Southampton a lift and another cross was not dealt with by McNair, but Long could only fire over from 12 yards when he had time to pick his spot. Van Gaal: We were lucky Van Gaal: We were lucky That mistake was McNair's last involvement in the game as Van Gaal ruthlessly replaced the youngster with midfielder Ander Herrera and moved Michael Carrick into central defence. Southampton continued to have the upper hand after the break and David de Gea had to be alert to divert a Long header away from goal after Tadic found the former West Brom man with a wonderful cross. Ronald Koeman's side were left to rue that missed chance on 71 minutes as Van Persie showed his predatory skills to restore United's lead. Rooney sent in a whipped cross from the touchline that found the space between Forster and the defence and as the ball flew deep into the box, Van Persie was quickest to react at the back post and flicked the ball in the net. There was time for De Gea to once again deny Pelle with a one-handed save down to his left as United defended deep and soaked up pressure for the remaining 15 minutes, but they held on for a victory that their manager later described as \"lucky\". Gary Neville's verdict \"It was so bad at times. It got slightly better in the second half, but it wasn’t a good United performance even if it was a great result. They’ll think that's all that matters but they are going to have to step it up. They’ve got away with murder tonight really with that performance.

Wilfried Bony had given the visitors the lead against the run of play with a smart first-time finish from Jefferson Montero’s pass, but Carroll powered home his first goal since March to send the sides in level at the break. The England striker doubled his tally when he headed home a Stewart Downing corner on 66 minutes and Swansea were reduced to 10 men two minutes later when Lukasz Fabianski was sent off for rushing out of his area and denying substitute Sakho a clear goalscoring opportunity. Garry Monk will be frustrated to see replays that indicated the West Ham forward handled the ball shortly before he was tripped and it was Sakho who completed the scoring three minutes from the end with a powerful shot past substitute goalkeeper Gerhard Tremmel. The Super Sunday panel discuss Lukasz Fabianski's red card during Swansea's 3-1 defeat at West Ham The Super Sunday panel discuss Lukasz Fabianski's red card during Swansea's 3-1 defeat at West Ham Sam Allardyce opted to pair Carroll with Enner Valencia up front for the match and West Ham started brightly with Downing playing at the front of a midfield diamond behind the strike duo. The home fans claimed two early penalties when Carl Jenkinson’s cross struck the elbow of Ashley Williams before Downing went down under a challenge from Leon Britton. Referee Chris Foy was unmoved on both occasions. Kevin Nolan forced a smart save from Fabianski after a clever free-kick from Downing in the 18th-minute and moments later was made to pay for his miss as Bony opened the scoring. Gylfi Sigurdsson played a clever ball in to Montero on the Swansea left, the Ecuador international getting in behind Jenkinson and rolling the ball back to Bony, who beat Adrian with a crisp side-footed shot from inside the six-yard box. Two headers from Andy Carroll and a late goal from Diafra Sakho saw West Ham climb to third Two headers from Andy Carroll and a late goal from Diafra Sakho saw West Ham climb to third The home team were visibly rattled and Swansea looked to double their lead when Sigurdsson and Bony tried their luck from range, but both failed to beat Adrian. Carroll looked to be the main outlet for West Ham throughout the first half and it was the big Englishman who found the equaliser with a trademark header. Jenkinson delivered an inch-perfect cross from the right and Carroll peeled away from his marker and looped the ball back across goal and over Fabianski into the net. Garry Monk was annoyed by the sending off of Lukasz Fabianski Garry Monk was annoyed by the sending off of Lukasz Fabianski The goal buoyed West Ham, who threw on top scorer Sakho for Valencia at half-time and started the second period in a positive mood, looking for impressive full-back Jenkinson to break down the right at every opportunity. But it was Swansea who had the first big chance of the half when Montero broke and fed Bony, who got the ball out of his feet and smashed a ferocious shot onto Adrian’s crossbar. The game was then turned on its head in a dramatic two-minute spell as Carroll put West Ham into the lead before Swansea were reduced to 10 men. The big striker jumped to powerfully head home a Stewart Downing corner on 66 minutes, despite the best efforts of Leon Britton on the line. Allardyce praises Hammers character Allardyce praises Hammers character The shell-shocked visitors then saw their goalkeeper sent off when Sakho raced through on goal and Fabianski rushed out of his area, only to impede the West Ham striker. Sakho carried on and struck the post from a tight angle, but referee Foy decided a clear goalscoring opportunity had been denied and he sent Fabianski for an early bath. However, Swansea boss Monk will not be happy to see replays suggesting Sakho may have handled the ball with his left arm shortly before the contact. Sakho hit the woodwork once again when he shot low across substitute goalkeeper Tremmel instead of crossing to strike partner Carroll, who was screaming for a hat-trick chance at the far post. But Sakho did eventually score three minutes from time when a long ball was flicked on by Carroll in the centre circle and he rushed past Richards before producing a powerful finish to beat Tremmel. The result sees West Ham complete a hat-trick of wins this week and climb above Manchester United and Southampton into third place.

Villa won at home for only the second time this season as they came from behind to beat Leicester City 2-1. Leonardo Ulloa gave the visitors the lead after 13 minutes when he tapped in from close range after a mistake from Brad Guzan, but Villa were soon level as Ciaran Clark headed home Ashley Westwood’s free-kick a few minutes later. Westwood was carried off on a stretcher before half-time after a challenge from Jamie Vardy but Villa secured victory when Alan Hutton fired a low shot past Kasper Schmeichel in the 71st minute. Leicester ended the game with 10 men after Paul Konchesky was shown a straight red card following an altercation with Hutton. The win moves Villa up to 11th in the Premier League table while Leicester remain bottom. The Super Sunday panel discuss the red card shown to Leicester's Paul Konchesky at Aston Villa The Super Sunday panel discuss the red card shown to Leicester's Paul Konchesky at Aston Villa Both sides made two changes from their midweek matches, Charles N’Zogbia and Carlos Sanchez coming in for Villa and Danny Simpson and Liam Moore starting for Leicester. The Foxes had struggled for goals on their travels this season – scoring just three in their previous seven matches – but they were given a helping hand for the opener by Guzan. The Villa goalkeeper should have gathered Riyad Mahrez’s low shot in the 13th minute but looked to be wrong-footed and instead could only deflect it out for Ulloa to tap in. Fortunately for the American it did not take his side long to respond as just four minutes later Westwood curled in a fine free-kick that Clark stooped to head home from eight yards out. Agbonlahor happy with home win Agbonlahor happy with home win Buoyed by the goal, Villa looked the better side for the rest of the half as they worked the ball around well without creating too many chances. Guzan was also largely untroubled at the other end but did narrowly avoid conceding a penalty when he came rushing out to try to beat Vardy to a ball over the top and just got there ahead of the forward. The half ended on a sour note for Villa when Westwood had to be carried off on a stretcher after a tackle from Vardy. Leicester were also forced into a change at the interval after Ulloa picked up a knock late in the half and was replaced by David Nugent. Lambert delighted with win Lambert delighted with win Both sides went close during a bright start to the second half as Tom Cleverley and Jeffrey Schlupp failed to hit the target from promising positions. Christian Benteke then spurned an excellent opportunity to give Villa the lead when he was played in by Kieran Richardso only to be foiled by Schmeichel who came diving out at his feet. Schmeichel saved from Agbonlahor a few minutes later while at the other end Guzan also had to make a sharp stop to palm Nugent’s dipping half-volley over the bar. A few minutes later Villa found the winning goal when Agbonlahor broke away down the left and passed inside for Benteke, who clipped a pass over the top for Hutton as he came charging up from right-back. Pearson: We need a victory Pearson: We need a victory The defender had not scored for four years but showed good composure to take a touch and volley a low shot past Schmeichel. It was the first time Villa had scored in the second half since April 5 but their efforts to add to their lead were thwarted by Schmeichel, who saved well from a Benteke header and then kept out another effort from the following corner. Leicester's task was made more difficult when Konchesky was shown a straight red card in the 80th minute following a clash with Hutton. It was unclear whether the defender was dismissed for the challenge or the following altercation with Hutton, but Leicester could not stage a late comeback with 10 men as their run without a victory extended to 10 matches.

Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho was looking for a first ever League win at Newcastle but Papiss Cisse came off the bench to put the hosts 2-0 up. Mourinho accepts defeat Mourinho accepts defeat The Magpies then had Steven Taylor sent off and Didier Drogba pulled a goal back for Chelsea but the hosts held on to secure a famous win. Chelsea were comfortably the better side for the first half-hour and Willian twice put shots from the edge of the area just wide of Rob Elliot’s post, while Gary Cahill headed over from a Cesc Fabregas corner. However, the hosts eventually roused themselves and almost took the lead when Ayoze Perez played in Jack Colback with a delightful little reverse pass, only for Thibaut Courtois to charge off his line and pull off a fine save. Pardew proud of players Pardew proud of players But the visitors finished the half in the ascendancy and Oscar was not far wide with an acrobatic overhead kick just before half-time. Newcastle goalkeeper Elliot picked up an injury when making a clearance just before the interval and had to be replaced by Jak Alnwick. And the promising youngster was soon called into action, punching a Fabregas free-kick clear as Chelsea made a lively start to the second period. Newcastle boss Alan Pardew decided a further change was necessary and his decision to bring Cisse on for Remy Cabella paid a swift dividend. Moussa Sissoko made inroads down the left before setting up Sammy Ameobi for a low cross which Cahill failed to cut out at the near post, allowing Cisse (57) to turn the ball into the net from close range. Sissoko then headed over the bar after the ball had bounced around following a corner, and Mourinho decided his side needed a revamp. Costa: Challenged by Dummett Andre Schurrle came on, and swiftly tested Alnwick with a low effort from 30 yards out, and he was soon followed off the bench by Drogba and Filipe Luis. Chelsea began to dominate possession but Newcastle defended valiantly, led by captain Fabricio Coloccini, who brilliantly blocked a Diego Costa shot. And Eden Hazard was then unlucky to see a shot come back off the post after he had been picked out in the box by Branislav Ivanovic. Costa: In action for Chelsea But Newcastle then stunned the leaders by doubling their lead with a breakaway goal. The hosts worked it neatly in the middle of the park, allowing Colback to play Sissoko in on goal and, although the midfielder got his legs in a mess and seemed to have squandered the chance, he poked the ball across to Cisse (78), who calmly fired into the empty net. Chelsea were on the ropes but they got a lifeline when Taylor picked up his second yellow card of the match for a lunge on Schurrle 30 yards out. And there was even greater encouragement for the visitors when Fabregas chipped the subsequent free-kick into the goal mouth and Drogba (83) got there before Alnwick to nod Chelsea right back into contention. With seven minutes left, plus ample injury-time, Chelsea laid siege to the Newcastle goal and Alnwick produced a great save to tip a Costa shot over the bar. The Newcastle goalkeeper then kept out a raking Luis drive from distance but there were more scares to come in six minutes of injury-time. However, Ivanovic shot wide and Drogba glanced a header the wrong side of the post from Chelsea's point of view, as Newcastle hung on to triumph after a tumultuous second-half which opened up the

through for visitors Goalkeeper Allan McGregor's top-class performance helped to halt Hull's losing streak in a 0-0 draw at home to West Brom. A ninth-minute penalty miss from Graham Dorrans summed up another frustrating afternoon for the Baggies, who remain just one point above today’s opponents in 15th. Hull drop into the relegation zone, but things could have been worse were it not for the display of their goalkeeper, who pushed away a routine spot-kick to keep the sides level. Jake Livermore left Michael Oliver without much choice when he wrestled Victor Anichebe to the ground, but the failure from the spot set the tone for the rest of the afternoon. McGregor: Kept clean sheet and saved penalty Anichebe won the early penalty and was lively throughout the game, so it was easy to see why he had started ahead of the more slightly framed Saido Berahino. For Hull, Sone Aluko had kept his place after his vital goal in midweek, and Abel Hernandez started alongside him. Going forward, it doesn't look like a partnership that will work long-term as Aluko was shifted out wide and Hernandez seems to prefer playing as the lone striker. The visitors had already been denied a third-minute shout after Anichebe fell under the challenge of Craig Dawson in the box, but referee Michael Oliver showed no hesitation shortly afterwards when the same player was pulled back by Livermore. Dorrans' penalty was placed well enough but Hull keeper Allan McGregor guessed right to dive to his left and paw the ball clear to the delight of the Tigers fans behind his goal. McAuley return pleases Irvine McAuley return pleases Irvine The first half at the KC Stadium witnessed a mere six shots and only one on target, so it was no surprise the fans didn’t even wait until half-time to go and get their hot drinks. Hull showed some signs of stirring after the break with Aluko scuffing a deflected shot wide before the hosts almost snatched the lead just before the hour mark. Livermore caused problems again two minutes later when a spell of home pressure ended in the former Tottenham man tugging a low shot straight at Foster from 18 yards. Final ball disappoints Bruce Final ball disappoints Bruce The Baggies' best chance came in the 72nd minute when Craig Gardner was fouled by Tom Huddlestone and from the resulting free-kick Gardner drew a rare save out of McGregor. Irvine had seen enough, immediately introducing Berahino, to the obvious pleasure of the visiting Baggies fans. But as with so many of Berahino's recent performances since his call-up by Roy Hodgson for last month's double-header against Slovenia and Scotland, he seemed curiously off the pace and never threatened McGregor in the home goal. Hernandez came close with a late header for Hull and Brown Ideye could have won it for the Baggies three minutes into injury-time but once again, McGregor was there to save his teammates. Baggies goalkeeper Ben Foster only made just two saves in a disjointed 90 minutes. Alan Irvine will likely be the happier of the two managers, a contrast to the exasperated Steve Bruce who spent most of the second half pacing his technical area. SOCCER SATURDAY ANALYSIS - Charlie Nicholas Nicholas: Hull offered nothing Nicholas: Hull offered nothing For the first 20 minutes, maybe a little bit more, West Brom were the better team - but only because Hull had nothing at all to offer going forward. Hull played a back four but I was surprised he left young Andrew Robertson out. I’d always play him in the home games. He can pin the opposition back. That’s the one thing West Brom didn’t want, because they didn’t have Berahino up front. West Brom got a penalty. It was a bad decision from Livermore, hanging onto Anichebe. He turned him for fun and all of a sudden he was dragged back. Penalty. It was a poor penalty from Dorrans, though. He tried to steer it to McGregor’s left. He’s got half-decent pace on it but McGregor is so good at penalties and made a lovely save. After that no efforts from Hull or West Brom, it was a really poor first half. The second half got better, but only when Bruce made some changes. Bruce will be more disappointed because he’s at home, whereas Irvine is thinking 'we weren’t really troubled at all until the last few minutes'. It was a decent away result and clean sheet for Irvine and West Brom.

The former England captain was named on the bench by Brendan Rodgers with crucial games against Basel and Manchester United coming up next week, but was thrown on after 65 minutes to try to help break the deadlock. However, Gerrard could do little to rescue a forgettable performance from the home team and Sunderland returned to the north east with a deserved Premier League point. Rodgers: Players gave everything Rodgers: Players gave everything Indeed, Gus Poyet will feel his side could have gone home with more after seeing a strong penalty appeal turned down in the third minute before Wes Brown headed over the best chance of the game on the stroke of half-time. The big talking point ahead of kick-off was Rodgers’ decision to leave out his captain for the second Saturday in a row, opting instead to play Adam Lallana, Philippe Coutinho and Raheem Sterling behind Rickie Lambert. And without Gerrard, Liverpool struggled to make an impact in the early stages. Midway through the first half, Sunderland boasted 63% of the possession and were the better side for long spells. They might have had a penalty as early as the third minute when Connor Wickham went down under a challenge from Martin Skrtel, but referee Neil Swarbrick waved play on. Opportunity missed for Poyet Opportunity missed for Poyet Liverpool’s first real chance came in the 23rd minute when Lallana turned his man inside out and delivered a delicious early ball to Lambert at the far post, but his header was wide of the target. Sunderland forward Wickham called for another penalty when he went down in the 36th minute, but this time Swarbrick had an easy decision to make as there was clearly no touch from Lucas. Santiago Vergini picked up the first booking of the game in the 41st minute for a tug on Sterling when the Liverpool man was trying to scamper away and was perhaps lucky not to pick up another – and an early bath – when he tripped the same player three minutes later. The best chance of the first half came with the final touch of the opening period when Seb Larsson’s corner found the head of an unmarked Brown inside the six-yard box. It looked easier to score than to miss, but the defender headed over the bar and into the Kop. Sunderland continued where they left off after the break when Skrtel's attempt to clear Adam Johnson's corner fell straight to Wickham who unleashed a left-footed volley from 10 yards out, but he fired across Simon Mignolet's goal and wide of the target. The Sunderland striker, playing wide of a front three, found more room on the edge of the Liverpool area moments later, but his deflected effort hit the side netting. Rodgers reluctantly threw on Gerrard for Lallana in the 65th minute and he promptly produced the pass of the game with a brilliant measured ball out to Coutinho, only to see his team-mate waste the opportunity. Sterling was frustrated for long spells, but looked Liverpool’s best outlet in the closing stages and almost created the first goal when he won the ball inside his own half and raced to the edge of the opposition area. His square ball found Coutinho on the edge of the area, but his firm shot was pushed away by a good save by Costel Pantilimon. At the other end, Mignolet was also called into action when he pushed away a 20-yard rasping effort from Jordi Gomez. Sterling called for a penalty with seven minutes left when his mazy run took him into the area and he went down under a challenge from Brown. The England winger might be embarrassed to see the replays, which suggested hardly any contact. That was the last moment of note in a largely forgettable game, which leaves Liverpool in ninth and Sunderland in 14th. SOCCER SATURDAY ANALYSIS - Paul Merson Merson shocked by Liverpool display Merson shocked by Liverpool display I couldn’t believe how bad Liverpool were. They had no real play about them, they gave the ball away cheaply and didn’t keep it for more than six passes. Sterling was the only player who ran at people. I was really disappointed in Liverpool. Steven Gerrard has to play, tired or not tired. For me, this was a bigger game than Tuesday night [against Basel in the Champions League]. I think Gerrard is still top drawer. He hit one pass that was unbelievable. Sunderland left Cattermole out and brought Bridcutt in but they were really comfortable. The goalkeeper made two saves, one from Lucas, which I would have saved, and one from Coutinho, which was straight at him. He had nothing to do. Sunderland worked their socks off and thoroughly deserved a draw.

Sean Dyche's side arrived at Loftus Road on Saturday looking to extend a four-match unbeaten run, but they found Robert Green in inspired form in the opening half and failed to breach a well-marshalled home defence after the break. Austin was sent off for a second bookable offence moments after doubling the lead for the hosts, but Burnley could not make their numerical advantage count over the final 20 minutes. The outcome could have been vastly different had Burnley converted some clear-cut openings in an entertaining first 45 minutes, but a combination of Green and the woodwork kept the scoreline goalless. Redknapp hails 'big win' Redknapp hails 'big win' After Ashley Barnes had sliced wide from the edge of the box, Scott Arfield appeared set to break the deadlock when Green collided with Mauricio Isla as he attempted to claim a cross. But Green picked upself up to block Arfield's shot with his face and Richard Dunne was on hand to mop up and clear the danger. Both teams looked to get forward at every opportunity, but they were let down by the final ball when getting into a threatening position. However, Green then pulled off one of the saves of the season to deny George Boyd after the home side had failed to fully clear a Burnley corner on the half-hour mark. Boyd's well-struck 25-yarder looked destined for the top corner, but Green flung himself to his left and got just enough glove on the ball to deflect it onto the post. QPR then responded with a flowing move that resulted in a huge chance for Eduardo Vargas, who cut in from the left and beat Tom Heaton only to have his shot blocked on the goalline by Michael Keane. Jason Shackell threw himself in front of a decent shot from Fer as QPR began to get on top, and Shackell then did well to deny Austin a shooting chance seconds before the interval. Dyche feels Burnley delivered Dyche feels Burnley delivered Shackell was again well-placed to divert another Vargas effort behind before QPR's bright start to the second half was rewarded with the opening goal on 50 minutes. Bobby Zamora's delightful flick released Austin and the former Burnley striker squared for Fer, whose shot took a huge deflection off the sliding Ben Mee and ballooned over Heaton and into the net. Burnley responded in positive style, but Danny Ings headed wastefully wide at the far post before Boyd blazed over the bar and Heaton got down well to his right to keep out Joey Barton's low fizzer at the other end. But Heaton was powerless to prevent QPR's second goal in the 73rd minute as Isla picked up a superb crossfield pass from Niko Kranjcar and squared for Austin to power home from six yards. Austin had been booked a minute before scoring, and he received his marching orders moments afterwards after appearing to catch Keane in the face with a loose arm as they contested a header. Boyd escaped a yellow card for a similar challenge on Dunne, who got his head to a number of balls into the box as Burnley opted for route one in the closing 10 minutes. But it was QPR who came closest to scoring again when Barton latched onto a precision pass from Fer before having his shot beaten away by Heaton. Green's goal was rarely under threat over the final five minutes, and Hull's goalless draw at home to West Brom allowed Harry Redknapp's side to move a point clear of the drop zone.

The Gunners are the team Stoke relish taking on more than any other and the home fans were in dreamland after Peter Crouch, with the fastest goal of the Premier League season, Bojan Krkic and Jonathan Walters handed the Potters a remarkable 3-0 advantage before half-time. Hughes happy with fast start Hughes happy with fast start But after Bojan had a fourth ruled out for offside, Arsenal staged a fightback with Santi Cazorla scoring from the penalty spot before Aaron Ramsey further reduced the deficit. However, Calum Chambers was shown his second yellow card with time running out and the home side held on for maximum points to inflict more misery on Arsene Wenger. The result brought an end to Arsenal's run of three successive wins and ended a losing sequence of three for the hosts. Crouch praises 'incredible' Stoke Crouch praises 'incredible' Stoke Arsenal stay in sixth spot with 23 points while Mark Hughes' men move up to 12th position. The bad blood between these teams dates back to the challenge made by Ryan Shawcross on Ramsey nearly five years ago that broke the Arsenal player's leg. Wenger was unhappy with pre-match comments from Shawcross hyping up the rivalry and the Stoke captain's name was greeted with loud boos from the visiting fans. But they were silenced only 19 seconds into the match as Steven Nzonzi got away down the right and sent over a cross that Chambers failed to clear under pressure from Mame Biram Diouf. The ball ran to Crouch - making his first start in more than a month - and he had the simple task of tapping it in after goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez lost his balance and fell over. Teenage defender Hector Bellerin was making only his second Premier League start for Arsenal and his fine cross in the 11th minute should have set up an equaliser but Olivier Giroud headed wide. Bojan has grown into Stoke's main creative force and his link-up play, in particular with Crouch, was causing Arsenal real problems. Stoke were relishing the lively atmosphere and tempo and full-back Phil Bardsley got into the spirit with a fierce shot that Martinez could only push uncomfortably away. Fortunately for the Arsenal keeper, Chambers reacted quickly to ensure Crouch could not take advantage of the rebound. Wenger: We were dominated Wenger: We were dominated Arsenal looked sporadically dangerous and Asmir Begovic may well have been struggling had Cazorla's 20-yard effort been on target rather than just over the bar. But largely the game was being controlled by Stoke and it was no more than they and Bojan deserved in the 35th minute when the Spaniard classily converted Walters' terrific cross. The gleeful chant of '2-0 to the rugby team' rung around the stadium - mocking a famous Wenger jibe about Stoke's style of play under former manager Tony Pulis. But even the Arsenal boss must have been impressed by the fluidity of Stoke, who were simply outplaying his side. Begovic had to be alert to preserve the lead in the 38th minute when a Giroud header deflected off Shawcross, but just before half-time Stoke added a third. Stoke surprise Mertesacker Stoke surprise Mertesacker Bojan's corner was headed down by Crouch and an unmarked Walters slammed the 100th club goal of his career high into the net. Unsurprisingly, Wenger shuffled things around for the second half, sending on Danny Welbeck for Bellerin, with Mathieu Flamini moving to right-back. Welbeck was straight into the action, seeing a shot deflected wide, but Stoke continued to pose plenty of problems. Martinez was having an uncomfortable afternoon and he was caught out by a Bojan free-kick in the 51st minute. The keeper had to dive back towards his goal to keep it out and was fortunate the ball arrived at Geoff Cameron's feet too quickly for the defender to do anything with it. At the other end, Alexis Sanchez almost made Nzonzi pay for an error when he ran through on goal, beating Shawcross and Begovic, but shot against the post. It looked curtains for Arsenal when Bojan found the net for the second time in the 65th minute, but a belated offside flag cut short the celebrations. The Gunners went down the other end and won a penalty when Diouf tripped Flamini. Begovic got a hand to Cazorla's shot but could not keep it out - and two minutes later Ramsey reduced the deficit to a single goal. Begovic produced a fine save from Welbeck but Sanchez's corner picked out Ramsey at the back post and he shot through a crowd of players. Arsenal pushed hard for an equaliser but found themselves reduced to 10 men 12 minutes from time when Chambers was shown a second yellow card for pulling Bojan. And, despite putting Stoke under a lot of pressure, the equaliser did not come. SOCCER SATURDAY ANALYSIS - Matt Le Tissier Le Tissier: Stoke worthy winners Le Tissier: Stoke worthy winners I'd say Stoke were worthy winners, based on that first-half alone. They got a massive boost after 19 seconds when Crouch tapped in. It was poor defending and Calum Chambers should have done much better with the cross when it came in, but Crouch was there on the spot. Stoke worked their socks off in that first half. Arsenal had a fair bit of possession and Giroud should have equalised with a header but once Bojan got the second goal Stoke were really in the ascendency and Walters, just before half-time, seemed to put the game to bed at 3-0. Then Stoke looked like they'd got a fourth. It took the referee so long to decide they weren’t going to count it, we were waiting for the kick-off. But he gave Diouf offside, saying he was in the keepers eyeline when Bojan had the shot, and then Arsenal went down the other end and won the penalty. All of a sudden the whole momentum changed and Aaron Ramsey, a few minutes later, put them back in the game. At that point you would have put money on Arsenal getting something out of the game. Stoke couldn’t get out of their own half. Chambers then got sent off, picking up a second yellow for an innocuous looking challenge. I thought it was pretty harsh to send him off for that. Stoke held on after that for a great win. Bojan, in particular, was very good today. He’s taken a while to settle in but he was bang on his game today and impressive throughout.

Tottenham Hotspur's struggles at White Hart Lane this season continued as they were largely second best in a goalless draw with Crystal Palace. The closest either side came to breaking the deadlock was when substitute Jason Puncheon smashed a shot against the bar late in the second half. Spurs’ best chances largely fell to Roberto Soldado, but the out-of-form striker failed to even hit the target from three decent openings. Joe Ledley also fired over from a couple of promising positions inside the box while Hugo Lloris saved well from Scott Dann and Yannick Bolasie. The draw keeps Palace just above the relegation zone while Spurs remain 10th. Marouane Chamakh holds off Ryan Mason It was another disappointing result and performance for Spurs, who showed two changes to the side that lost at Chelsea in midweek, with Soldado and Eric Dier starting ahead of Aaron Lennon and Vlad Chiriches. Palace made just one change from their defeat against Aston Villa, as Ledley replaced Dwight Gayle. After a cagey start, it was Christian Eriksen who created the first opening when he turned Martin Kelly with a brilliant piece of skill in the corner but then wastefully fired into the side netting. That, though, did not signal a spell of Spurs pressure and instead it was Palace who threatened to break the deadlock. Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino said his side were tired after a busy week. Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino said his side were tired after a busy week. Bolasie looked a constant threat down the left wing with his pace and willingness to run at defenders and he created a great opening for Ledley in the 21st minute. Just as Eriksen did to Kelly, Bolasie pulled off a wonderful trick in the corner to escape Eriksen, run along the byline and pull the ball back for Ledley on the penalty spot, but he shot over the bar under little pressure. Spurs had a couple of chances of their own shortly afterwards when Soldado fired over from Ben Davies’ low cross from the left and then failed to hit the target with a header from Eriksen’s cross. In between Soldado’s efforts, Palace went closer when Lloris had to dive at full stretch to keep out a Dann header from a corner. Wilfried Zaha curled a shot narrowly wide towards the end of the half following another superb piece of skill that saw him jink between two Spurs defenders. The hosts made a change at the break as the ineffective Erik Lamela was replaced by Nacer Chadli, but it failed to spark Spurs into life. Neil Warnock said he was proud of his players following the draw. Neil Warnock said he was proud of his players following the draw. Instead it was Palace who continued to threaten more, with Bolasie and Zaha testing the opposition full-backs every time they picked up the ball. Still, Spurs could have taken the lead on the hour mark when Eriksen slipped in Soldado with a neat pass, but the striker again failed to even hit the target when he should have at least tested Julian Speroni. The chance was a rare opening for Spurs in the second half and it was Palace who raised the tempo and piled on the pressure in the final 20 minutes. They went closest to taking the lead when Bolasie’s cross deflected into the path of Puncheon and he lashed a shot against the underside of the bar. Lloris then saved well from Bolasie before Ledley again failed to test the keeper from a promising position inside the box after a clever one-two with Puncheon. Spurs looked more threatening with the late introduction of Lennon but could not grab a winner and the final whistle was greeted with a smattering of boos around White Hart Lane. SOCCER SATURDAY ANALYSIS - Phil Thompson Phil Thompson on the goalless draw at White Hart Lane. Phil Thompson on the goalless draw at White Hart Lane. The better chances fell to Crystal Palace, they worked the keeper more. Spurs had the most possession but it was all negative, playing around the back and in midfield. Speroni has made about two saves, but they weren’t difficult, while Lloris made two absolute world-class saves. One was from a Scott Dann header and one from Puncheon, who had come on and had a real impact. It was in the wide areas, where Palace caused problems. Boos rang out when Spurs went off. Soldado had a couple of chances but Harry Kane looked tired. The three subs didn’t make any impact, unlike Puncheon. A draw was a fair result and Palace have enough to survive in this division. They keep feeding Bolasie and Zaha, while Dann and Hangeland were absolutely terrific.

It killed a good pre-match atmosphere and City struggled to get the crowd going as both sides endured a sloppy opening spell. City broke the deadlock inside 25 minutes, though, as Toure slid a pass through for Milner and the midfielder got a touch on the ball before Jagielka came across to make a challenge. Referee Andre Marriner pointed to the spot straight away and Toure coolly slotted the penalty into the bottom corner. The second half proved a much more open affair as youngster Pozo – who replaced Aguero – was denied low by Howard after excellent work by Milner out wide.

Martinez soon introduced Barkley to the action, and the change seemed to spur the visitors on as they enjoyed much more time on the ball.

JAMIE REDKNAPP’S VERDICT “When you put it into context – you lose your star striker after two minutes, you’ve got no Vincent Kompany, no David Silva – it’s a huge result. That’s so important, especially after what happened with Chelsea earlier. Those three points are vital. They weren’t at their best, but with those games you just need to win, to get across the line, and that’s what Manuel Pellegrini will be so pleased about.” Player Ratings Manchester City: Hart (7); Zabaleta (7), Demichelis (7), Mangala (5), Clichy (7); Fernando (6), Toure (7); Jesus Navas (6), Milner (9), Nasri (8); Aguero (5).

The Chile international finally beat Fraser Forster, who had produced a couple of superb saves earlier in the game, to quieten the frustrations of the home support a minute from the end of another game that saw the Gunners struggle in the final third until Olivier Giroud came off the bench. Defeat was tough on Southampton, who produced a far more solid defensive display than their defeat by Manchester City last time out, and a point would have been a decent reward after finishing the game with 10 men, the superb Toby Alderweireld limping off after Ronald Koeman had made all his substitutions. After a cagey opening Arsenal created the first chance on six minutes, but Danny Welbeck failed to hit the target after being set free by a lovely Sanchez through-ball. Southampton’s first opening should really have seen Graziano Pelle end his goalless streak at five games, but the Italy striker, after doing all the hard work to get on the end of a Steven Davis knock-down, smashed his volley way over with only Emiliano Martinez to beat. Sanchez and Santi Cazorla continued to probe for Arsenal without much in the way of end-product, until midway through the half when Forster was finally forced into a save, getting down quickly to keep out a low Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain drive. Welbeck almost gave Arsenal the lead in cheeky fashion with a back-heeled effort after a mistake from sub Maya Yoshida but a deflection took the ball wide of Forster’s goal. Pelle tested Martinez from 25 yards, but the Arsenal keeper was equal to his rising drive, and the best chance of the half eventually fell to the home side in added time, with a glancing header from Welbeck coming off Alderweireld and forcing Forster into a fine reaction save. Gunners boss Arsene Wenger changed things around at half-time, moving Sanchez up front and Welbeck out to the left, but it was Southampton who started on the front foot with Laurent Koscielny blocking a goalbound effort from the industrious Pelle. Home frustrations grew as moves continued to break down around the box, Southampton’s usually stingy defence looking solid, and the visitors remained dangerous on the break with Shane Long making a hash of a chance after a superb flowing move from deep. Cazorla blazed way over the bar, bringing whistles from the crowd, and the collective sighs grew every time a simple pass ended up in touch or in Southampton's possession. Wenger introduced Olivier Giroud with 25 minutes left on the clock, for a disappointed Oxlade-Chamberlain, and the Frenchman almost made a quick impact - he was played in by another delicious Sanchez pass but saw his left-foot volley punched away by Forster. Seconds later, with Arsenal suddenly finding their stride, Giroud's deft flick set Welbeck up for another chance but the England 'keeper stretched full-length and tipped his shot around the post. Southampton continued to create chances on the counter with sub Sadio Mane wasting a decent shooting chance and then having an effort blocked by Per Mertesacker. They were forced to play the last seven minutes with 10 men, losing the influential Alderweireld - who excelled at the back and later in a defensive midfield role - to what seemed to be a hamstring injury. Arsenal pushed for a winner and it so nearly came with four minutes remaining, Giroud pulling away to the far post and heading across Forster, only for the 'keeper to come up with another superb save. But the vital goal did arrive just a minute later as Sanchez made the most of some rare space in the box to convert an Aaron Ramsey pull back as a number of home players were berating the officials for not giving a penalty for handball. The wind was firmly out of Southampton's sails and Arsenal, who climb into sixth in the table, held on comfortably for only their third home win of the season and closed within two points of the Champions League places. Paul Walsh’s verdict “Southampton defended brilliantly and you can see why they’ve got a good defensive record. They really frustrated Arsenal. The first half was a really even contest and it really ebbed and flowed, but it seems they made a conscious decision to sit deep on the edge of the box and protect the central area, not allow Arsenal to play through them and play on the counter-attack. In the end, that man Sanchez slid one home right at the death of the game.” Player ratings Arsenal: Martinez (7), Chambers (7), Monreal (5), Koscielny (6), Mertesacker (6); Flamini (5), Ramsey (6), Cazorla (6), Sanchez (8), Oxlade-Chamberlain (6), Welbeck (6).

After Harry Kane hit the bar with an early header, Chelsea broke the deadlock in the 19th minute when Eden Hazard fired past Hugo Lloris from close range. A poor clearance from Lloris was punished five minutes later when Oscar slipped in Didier Drogba - who started in place of the suspended Diego Costa - to double the advantage. The result was firmly put beyond doubt in the 73rd minute when substitute Loic Remy slid a shot into the corner. Eden Hazard celebrates scoring the opening goal. The victory – Chelsea’s seventh in a row at home in the league this season – keeps the Blues six points clear at the top of the table while Spurs slip down to 10th.

After a bright start from the visitors, Kane headed against the crossbar in the eighth minute from Aaron Lennon’s right-wing cross with Thibaut Courtois beaten. Kane then went close again a few moments later when he dispossessed Gary Cahill, drove into the box and fired a shot across goal inches wide of the far post. Chelsea had offered little in response at the other end until they took the lead against the run of play in the 19th minute. Hazard played the ball into the feet of Drogba in the box and the striker laid it off nicely for the on-rushing Belgian to collect and fire past Lloris. While some of the blame for the goal must go to Lennon for not tracking Hazard’s run into the area, there was no doubt the Spurs stopper was at fault for the second. The keeper’s poor clearance landed straight at the feet of Hazard, who worked the ball quickly forward to Oscar. He slipped in Drogba and the striker held off Jan Vertonghen’s challenge before firing home. The five-minute double seemed to sap Spurs’ confidence and they created nothing more of note before the break. Willian saw a couple of shots comfortably saved by Lloris at the other end but in the second half Chelsea were content to sit back and soak up Spurs’ pressure.

They’ve got a fantastic goalkeeper and one of the strongest defences – Gary Cahill may have to miss a few games so that won’t do them any favours. In midfield, Matic and Fabregas are fantastic and you’ve got the creation with the other midfielders. They have a choice of three players up front. Apart from Manchester City, it’s hard to see which team could beat them. \"With Spurs there was a lot of pass, pass, pass for the sake of it.

The visitors started brightly on Merseyside but it was Everton who grew into the opening half, taking the lead in the 34th minute through Romelu Lukaku’s sixth league goal of the season. Sone Aluko's equaliser at Goodison stopped a run of four straight league defeats. Sone Aluko's equaliser at Goodison stopped a run of four straight league defeats. But the Tigers, who were staring down the barrel of a fifth straight defeat in the league, showed plenty of fighting spirit and hit back just after the break through Sone Aluko’s brilliant solo effort to earn a point. Steve Bruce reacted to his side’s 3-0 defeat against Manchester United last weekend by making four changes to his starting line-up with Liam Rosenior, Tom Huddlestone, Stephen Quinn and David Meyler all coming in and the move had the desired effect with the visitors enjoying the best of the opening stages. Romelu Lukaku was frustrated with 1-1 draw at home to Hull. Romelu Lukaku was frustrated with 1-1 draw at home to Hull. Much to the frustration of the Goodison faithful, Roberto Martinez’s side were slow out of the traps and it took until the 14th minute for Everton to muster any chance of note as Lukaku turned sharply but fired straight at Allan McGregor. Midway through the first half the home side started to dominate possession and smart interplay between the impressive Ross Barkley and Gareth Barry should have served as a warning to the visitors. Seamus Coleman is challenged by Mohamed Diame The England pair exchanged passes on the edge of the Hull box with the ball eventually finding its way to Lukaku, but his shot was well blocked by Rosenior. The Belgium international was not to be denied for much longer, though, and he finally broke the deadlock after brilliant work from Kevin Mirallas down the Everton left 11 minutes before half-time. After a fine run he laid the chance on a plate for his fellow countryman to power home from six yards. Hull’s early work was undone and they looked to respond through an Ahmed Elmohamady cross but former Everton man Nikica Jelavic could not direct his header on goal. Roberto Martinez says he is proud of the character his side showed against Hull. Roberto Martinez says he is proud of the character his side showed against Hull. After the break it was Bruce’s men who once again looked the more likely with Mohamed Diame creating space inside the Everton box, however the former West Ham man’s shot was easily blocked. Everton again went forward through Lukaku, who this time turned provider, but Mirallas’ extravagant chip landed on the roof of the net. Hull were eventually rewarded when Aluko, who was a 53rd-minute replacement for the injured Diame, ghosted past Sylvain Distin before beating Tim Howard at his near post to hand his side a deserved equaliser. It could have got even better for Bruce’s side minutes later with Aluko again involved, but once again Jelavic guided his header just wide of the post. Martinez reacted by throwing on Steven Pienaar and Aiden McGeady for Mirallas and Muhamed Besic but Everton just could not find a way through Hull’s resolute defence. Steve Bruce was happy his Hull side stopped their four-game losing streak in the league. Steve Bruce was happy his Hull side stopped their four-game losing streak in the league. Chances were few and far between for both sides in the closing stages, but Everton had one final chance to steal all three points when they won a corner deep into injury-time. However, Barkley’s corner was a poor one and Hull, who have not won on their travels since August, held on for a point to move up to 17th in the table. Everton remain in 11th. Iain Dowie’s verdict “Hull started brightly, but Everton got going with a brilliant piece of play. When Lukaku bulleted it into the net you thought it was going to be all Everton, but in the second half, Everton didn’t come out. For Hull’s goal Tim Howard, who went down too early for Soldado’s goal at the weekend, was three yards outside his post and it was poor. I think Everton don’t know whether to play early to Lukaku to get the best out of him or continue the lovely passing game. It’s a bit of a dichotomy at the moment.” Player ratings Everton: Howard (6), Coleman (5), Jagielka (6), Distan (5), Baines (6), Besic (6), Barry (6), Barkley (6), Osman (6), Lukaku (6), Mirallas (7).

The champions did not have it all their own way in the first half and were made to come from behind after Connor Wickham deflected Pablo Zabaleta’s tackle beyond Joe Hart to hand the hosts a 19th-minute lead. Sergio Aguero again proved to be the inspirational figure for City, by firing home the equaliser in emphatic style within a matter of minutes before setting up Stevan Jovetic for the visitors' second five minutes before half-time. Zabaleta’s nonchalant chip beyond Costel Pantilimon in the Sunderland goal 10 minutes after the interval, followed by Aguero’s second 15 minutes later, sealed the three points for Manuel Pellegrini’s side who stay six points behind Chelsea at the top of the table. Pablo Zabaleta praised Sergio Aguero for his form and the effect he is having on the whole team. Pablo Zabaleta praised Sergio Aguero for his form and the effect he is having on the whole team. City looked like they meant business from the start with Jesus Navas sending in a cross which eluded Aguero's outstretched boot by inches with less than four minutes on the clock. Unfazed by their opponents' dominance in the opening exchanges, Sunderland had the first real opening of the match. Will Buckley, who deputised for former City winger Adam Johnson, ran into space on the right and crossed for Jack Rodwell whose shot was blocked by Zabaleta in the City box – the former City man would have been disappointed with his tame effort. Will Buckley says the game plan that served them well against Chelsea didn't work against Man City. Will Buckley says the game plan that served them well against Chelsea didn't work against Man City. Sunderland then grabbed a shock lead in the 19th minute when Sebastian Larsson threaded the ball towards Wickham and despite Zabaleta getting his foot on the ball first, he could only deflect it into the net off the striker. Sunderland’s celebrations lasted just a matter of minutes as City went in search of an immediate equaliser - and their top scorer Aguero duly obliged. Fernandinho exchanged passes with Yaya Toure and the Brazilian midfielder played it back to Aguero who, after collecting the ball and nutmegging the on-rushing Sebastian Coates, unleashed a fierce strike which nestled in the back of Pantilimon’s net before he had a chance to adjust his footing. Gus Poyet highlights the busy schedule as a reason for Sunderland's struggle against Man City. Gus Poyet highlights the busy schedule as a reason for Sunderland's struggle against Man City. The goal handed City an air of confidence with Toure orchestrating the game for large spells - and his incisive through-ball to Aguero on the edge of the box led to City’s second. After a 29-pass move, the Argentine played a neat flick into the path of Jovetic - who gratefully drilled his side's second under Pantilimon from close range. Sunderland were struggling to create much in the City half but they still came close in first-half injury-time when a Larsson corner found the head of Rodwell. In the resulting melee the hosts had a penalty shout for handball against Fernandinho turned down. City were in cruise control at the start of the second half, and after 10 minutes in which they passed the ball exquisitely, they extended their lead with another well-worked goal in the 55th minute. Manuel Pellegrini is pleased that his side have scored seven goals in two games. Manuel Pellegrini is pleased that his side have scored seven goals in two games. Samir Nasi picked up a short pass on the right side of the Sunderland box and fed Zabaleta, who produced a deft little chip to defy the onrushing John O'Shea and beat Pantilimon to put City 3-1 up. The hosts were given more of an opportunity to string together some moves as the away side sat back, but the City rearguard, which had shown signs of weakness in the early stages, coped with each effort comfortably. And Aguero wrapped up a sensational individual performance in the 71st minute when he was picked out by City substitute James Milner and turned to coax the ball past Pantilimon to round off the game and finally end their sorry run of four consecutive 1-0 defeats at the Stadium of Light. City cemented their position as Chelsea's main title rivals, while Sunderland failed to capitalise on Saturday's positive result against Chelsea and remain 14th in the table. Neil Mellor’s verdict \"I was really impressed with the performance overall, but it was a shaky start from City. Sunderland started better and got in their faces, but by the end of the game the confidence was flying for City. If Aguero is fit then you would fancy City to give anyone a game. You want that little bit of magic in the final third and City have got that with Aguero.

Midfielder George Boyd gave the home side a deserved lead after 34 minutes with a crisp shot from just outside the penalty area. However, the Magpies drew level right at the start of the second period thanks to Papiss Cisse’s well-taken volley, with neither side then doing enough to claim all three points. After a scrappy opening quarter to the match, it was the home team who began to take control of proceedings. First in-form Clarets frontman Danny Ings forced Newcastle No 1 Rob Elliott, who was replacing the injured Tim Krul in the visitors’ goal, into a fine one-handed reflex save. Alan Pardew: Pleased with his side's reaction to going one goal down Alan Pardew: Pleased with his side's reaction to going one goal down Then his strike partner Ashley Barnes shot over when well placed in the penalty area. Meanwhile, the Magpies had two half-chances with which to take a first-half lead, however, both forward Sammy Ameobi and then holding midfielder Mehdi Abeid were denied by Burnley goalkeeper Tom Heaton. And the visitors were made to pay for their profligacy in front of goal when Scotland international Boyd fired the home side in front 11 minute before the break. Right-back Kieran Trippier decided to go route one from the back and when Ings neatly headed his long ball down into the path of Boyd, the midfielder produced a fine finish through a crowd of Newcastle defenders to give Burnley the breakthrough. In fact, the Clarets should have doubled their advantage in first-half injury time after a lovely move involving both Boyd and Ings, however, after the latter’s neat back heel had given the onrushing David Jones a clear sight of goal, the midfielder blazed high and wide. Sean Dyche: Happy with Burnley's progress Sean Dyche: Happy with Burnley's progress And the north-east outfit took full advantage of that miss by equalising just three minutes after the interval, although Burnley will be kicking themselves after playing a helping hand in Newcastle’s goal. As after good work down the left by Ameobi, Trippier’s rash clearance fell straight at the feet of the Magpies’ half-time substitute Remy Cabella, and despite the Frenchman’s close-range shot being blocked, the ball was still worked out wide before Yoan Gouffran’s clever dummy gave Cisse the chance to level matters from six yards out. Thereafter, though, neither keeper was seriously threatened as the contest petered out to an inevitable draw, a result that suited Burnley far more than their opponents. Indeed the Clarets, unbeaten in their last four Premier League matches, are now out of the drop zone, while Newcastle slip away from the top four places. SOCCER SPECIAL ANALYSIS - PHIL THOMPSON Burnley moved out of the bottom three so it’s got to be a decent point for them. There was bad defending for both goals. The first one, Ings – who was the best player in the first half – cushioned a diagonal ball into the ‘D’, which should have been dealt with by the centre-backs and George Boyd, given time, put it in. For the Newcastle goal, it was just after half-time and it was shambolic by Burnley. Their defending was poor but Cisse was alive and alert when Gouffran flicked it on with his knee and put it into the back of the net.

"Steven Gerrard celebrates scoring Liverpool's second goal Steven Gerrard made the difference as Liverpool came from behind to beat 10-man Leicester 3-1 on Tuesday night. Gerrard was rested at the weekend amidst reports suggesting a rift with manager Brendan Rodgers, but the Reds skipper inspired his side to victory on his return. Leicester took an early lead when Leonardo Ulloa’s close-range shot bounced back off the post and deflected in via Simon Mignolet, but Liverpool quickly equalised through Adam Lallana. Gerrard slotted his team in front before Wes Morgan was shown a straight red card for bringing down Rickie Lambert as the last man, and then substitute Jordan Henderson wrapped up the points late on. Brendan Rodgers and Nigel Pearson give their reactions to Liverpool's 3-1 win at Leicester Brendan Rodgers and Nigel Pearson give their reactions to Liverpool's 3-1 win at Leicester Rodgers' controversial decision to rest Gerrard for the scrappy home win over Stoke on Saturday was vindicated as the former England captain inspired his team to only their third away league win of the season. Liverpool needed his injection of energy after they fell behind because of sloppy defending, with Mignolet almost gifting Esteban Cambiasso an open goal before sending the ball into his own net from Ulloa's shot. Lallana found the near corner from Lambert's knockdown in a familiar scene from their days together at Southampton, but Leicester were still very much in the game by the break. Ulloa: Celebrates Leicester's opener Gerrard began to pull the strings in the second half however, and found Raheem Sterling in a good position on the left; the winger's shot half-cleared by Morgan before dropping into Gerrard's stride to score. Gerrard was then involved in the move that led to Morgan's dismissal, with Lambert getting the better of the defender and clean through had he not been pulled down by his shirt by the Leicester captain. The Reds were in firm control from then on and Henderson found an empty net when Sterling cut the ball back from the byline on 83 minutes. It means a seventh defeat in nine Premier League games leaves Leicester bottom in the table. Lallana: Joy after equaliser SOCCER SPECIAL ANALYSIS - CHARLIE NICHOLAS Leicester were in the game for a long period but Wes Morgan had a crazy red card. He tried to be clever with the pass back, he could still have got there but he got desperate. Defensively Leicester are really struggling. Going forward they’ve got good energy, a good appetite for it. They had decent quality, too, and got in front tonight. But there was a big comeback from Liverpool. Steven Gerrard wasn’t fantastic but he’s still got a major part to play. His critics can sit back and say it’s over a period of time, but he scored the second goal to put them in front and overall his display was very solid indeed.

"report": "Manchester United recorded a fourth successive Premier League win after a 2-1 win against Stoke City at Old Trafford. Things seemed to be going United's way when Marouane Fellaini bagged his first Old Trafford goal in a red shirt with a towering header at the back post. But Stoke hit back when Steven Nzonzi rifled home his stinging drive into the far corner for his first Premier League goal of the season and his first goal anywhere since March to make it 1-1 at the break. There was some debate about who scored the winning goal as Juan Mata's free-kick looked to go straight through a crowd of players although Marcos Rojo claimed that he got the all-important touch. Marouane Fellaini was pleased to get on the scoresheet. Marouane Fellaini was pleased to get on the scoresheet. Then, in a nerve-jangling finish David de Gea made a stunning save to deny Mame Biram Diouf and then Ashley Young came to United's rescue with a sensational goal line clearance in the fourth minute of stoppage time as the hosts held on to move to within a point of third-placed Southampton. It was not until United were gifted an opportunity after 17 minutes that they came to life, as Stoke goalkeeper Asmir Begovic passed to Robin van Persie. The Dutchman powered into the box and pulled back to Herrera but the Spaniard was too hasty and shot over. Ander Herrera quickly made amends for that miss as four minutes later he collected a pass from Mata and lofted a dangerous cross for Fellaini at the back post. Erik Pieters failed to pick up the Belgian, who timed his leap superbly to head past a helpless Begovic. United also had a good appeal for a penalty turned down as James Wilson - starting in place of the injured Wayne Rooney - appeared to be kicked by Geoff Cameron but referee Jon Moss gave nothing. Louis van Gaal believes his Manchester United side have more to offer. Louis van Gaal believes his Manchester United side have more to offer. Stoke tried to respond and Pieters whipped in a good ball from the left looking for Stephen Ireland or Bojan Krkic, but Rojo intervened. It was clear Stoke were not prepared to surrender in the manner Hull did at the same ground on Saturday and they pulled back level before the break. Controversy arose as Fellaini went down clutching his neck as Assaidi won a 50-50 ball. Assaidi may have caught the United midfielder on the hand or top of the thigh in the challenge but not his neck, as the Belgian appeared to claim. Whatever occurred, Moss saw nothing untoward and both sides played on. Mark Hughes says that his side had no luck and bemoaned several refereeing decisions. Mark Hughes says that his side had no luck and bemoaned several refereeing decisions. Bojan ran at the heart of the United defence and was crowded out as he reached the edge of the area. United failed to clear, however, and the ball ran into the path of Nzonzi, who lashed home a fierce shot from just inside the 'D'. Fellaini continued to hold his neck but it did not seem to be affecting him just before half-time as he went close to restoring United's lead. United won a free-kick outside the box on the right and a shot from Van Persie took a deflection and found its way to the Belgian in front of goal. This time he scuffed a shot and Begovic saved at the second attempt. Stoke, who lost Steve Sidwell and Glenn Whelan to injury at the weekend, had another scare early in the second half when Pieters needed lengthy treatment after a clash with Van Persie. That incident occurred during a scrappy spell but United reclaimed the lead just before hour as Mata floated in a free-kick from the right. The ball appeared to dip over everyone in the area and bounce in at the far post, although Rojo claimed to have got a touch. Wilson, the 19-year-old who scored twice on his debut last season, almost scored a third for United after a good run from just inside the Stoke half but he clipped his shot just wide. Wilson made another charge but was crudely hacked down by Ireland, who was booked. Another good break led to a chance for Fellaini but he blasted wide. United were almost made to pay for those misses in a breathless four minutes of injury time. But De Gea, who had had a quiet game, remained alert to the last as he kept out a Diouf header and a powerful Marko Arnautovic strike. The latter seemed to no avail as the ball rolled along the line to Diouf, but Young dramatically hacked clear from under the crossbar. SOCCER SPECIAL ANALYSIS - PAUL MERSON That's four wins on the trot and it’s been a year since United have done that. They had to ride their luck at the end. De Gea made two unbelievable saves in the last two minutes, and Ashley Young cleared the ball off the line, when it was three-quarters of the way over the line. Bar that I thought United played well, if they didn’t pepper the goal. They closed Stoke down and with Wayne Rooney and Angel di Maria in the team they would have been better. It’s another win. You’ve got to keep on winning – that’s what this game is all about. Stoke will feel hard done by at the end, they threw the kitchen sink at them.

Wayne Routledge's accurate finish five minutes later wrapped up the points for the hosts and lifted the Swans above Arsenal into sixth in the table. For the best part of 80 minutes another frustrating outing appeared to be on the cards for Garry Monk's side as former England international Green produced one of the goalkeeping performances of the season during a somewhat uneventful opening 45 minutes in south Wales. Garry Monk commends his Swansea side and praises Wilfried Bony after the Swans beat QPR 2-0. Garry Monk commends his Swansea side and praises Wilfried Bony after the Swans beat QPR 2-0. In-form striker Wilfried Bony saw numerous attempts thwarted as too did Gylfi Sigurdsson, whose fierce near-post free-kick required the use of goal-line technology to ascertain whether it had crossed the line - somehow Green had clawed the ball out. But in the end the pressure told for Rangers who failed to produce anything more than a handful of clear-cut chances as Monk's side atoned for Saturday's disappointing draw with Crystal Palace to rightfully claim the three points their bright and persistent performance deserved. After Niko Krancjar had failed to keep his inviting first-minute free-kick on target Swansea took notice and quickly settled into their dominating possession game, limiting their opponents to fleeting ventures into opposition territory. Slick in possession and determined to stretch the Rangers defence, Swansea turned to their wide players Routledge and Jefferson Montero to unlock the resolute Rangers defence. Green made the first of a series of superb saves when Kyle Bartley’s thundering near-post header was parried away in the eight minute. The rebound fell to Bony who was unable to adjust his feet and steer a second shot on target. Montero was keen to test his Rangers marker Nedum Onuoha at every opportunity and he started another free-flowing move which ended with Neil Taylor squaring to Sigurdsson and the Icelandic international's shot squirming wide courtesy of a deflection off Joey Barton. Harry Redknapp admits his side were second best to an 'excellent' Swansea side. Harry Redknapp admits his side were second best to an 'excellent' Swansea side. Swansea came closest to breaking the deadlock after 37 minutes when Barton was booked for bringing down Routledge and Sigurdsson curled the free-kick around the Rangers wall. Green dived to his left to keep the shot out with television replays showing how close the ball was to crossing the line, only fractions preventing Swansea from taking the lead. But having dominated the first half there was almost a nasty sting in the tail for Swansea when Kranjcar crossed for Leroy Fer to steal into the box, but his header was sent straight at Lukasz Fabianski on his goal-line. The first-half pattern of Swansea creating chances but failing to take them continued within three minutes of the restart when Sigurdsson slipped Bony through, but Dunne raced back to block and the ball ended up on the roof of the Rangers net. Ashley Williams had to react smartly to stop Eduardo Vargas reaching a loose ball on the edge of the area and Swansea had to stay patient to work their way through a committed Rangers rearguard. Rangers were relieved when Green flapped at Montero's cross and no Swansea player gambled in the six-yard box, with Yun Suk-young allowed to scramble the ball to safety. Then Bony should have scored when Leon Britton and Routledge combined, but his finish was weak and straight at Green. Moments later Bony connected far better with Montero's centre but Green made an excellent stop low at his near post. But their resolute defending was to count for nothing as Swansea finally broke through in the final 12 minutes and Bony was close to adding a third in stoppage time when he struck a post. SOCCER SPECIAL ANALYSIS - MATT LE TISSIER If you’re going to stay up in this league you have to win at least two or three away games and QPR have got problems at the minute. That game was goalless for 78 minutes because of one person – Rob Green had an absolutely brilliant night. He was the only one unfortunate to be on the losing side; he was superb. He made some cracking saves and denied Bony three or four times in that game. It was only a matter of time before Swansea got the first goal.

Neil Warnock's side paid the price for failing to convert dominance into goals, although they found Villa keeper Brad Guzan in inspiring form throughout an entertaining battle at Selhurst Park. Benteke's first goal in nine months on his return from suspension handed Palace their fifth defeat in eight games, but the home side will be left to reflect on their lack of composure in the final third after dominating the majority of the match. Wilfried Zaha and Yannick Bolasie were constant threats to the Villa defence from the first whistle, but time and again the final ball was poorly-executed to the immense frustration of the vibrant home faithful. Paul Lambert heaped praise on Belgian striker Christian Benteke. Paul Lambert heaped praise on Belgian striker Christian Benteke. Zaha, in particular, gave Aly Cissokho a rough ride in the early stages and forced a series of corners, while Palace had the ball in the net in the sixth minute only to be denied by the offside flag. Guzan spilled a poor cross from Bolasie, but Dwight Gayle had strayed offside ahead of attempting to stab home the loose ball before Scott Dann rifled into the roof of the net. The Villa goalkeeper was alert to keep out a deflection from Cissokho after Gayle had failed to connect with Joel Ward's long ball, while Mile Jedinak's ambitious back-flick was also dealt with by Guzan. Benteke then left Dann trailing with a sublime turn on the edge of the Palace box, but his curling effort was palmed away by Julian Speroni and Guzan stood firm again as he held a decent strike from Martin Kelly. Neil Warnock says his side were not clinical enough. Neil Warnock says his side were not clinical enough. Dann was then at fault for Villa's goal on 32 minutes when he was carelessly robbed of possession on the wing by Benteke, who had plenty to do as he surged towards goal and placed a measured finish beyond Speroni and into the far corner. Palace responded instantly as Guzan threw up a strong right hand to beat away Zaha's powerful drive, and Bolasie's follow-up cannoned off Ciaran Clark's forehead. Guzan pulled off another smart save to keep out another Bolasie piledriver, and Palace wandered into the half-time interval wondering how they were a goal down having dominated the opening 45 minutes. The pattern continued after the break, with Marouane Chamakh heading wide under pressure from Clark before Zaha headed high and wide from Bolasie's deep cross. Guzan displayed excellent awareness to beat Frazier Campbell to the James McArthur's neat flick forward, and Campbell had appeals for a penalty waved away by Michael Oliver moments later after the Palace striker tangled with Clark. Andreas Weimann then spurned a glorious chance to double Villa's lead after the ball deflected to him via Brede Hangeland, but the Austrian hurried his shot and Speroni got down well to save with his shins. Villa's resolute defence continued to deal with a number of long punts into the penalty area as Palace continued their fruitless search for an equaliser, while Bolasie had another goalbound effort deflected wide by Jores Okore. The home side almost grabbed a point in the final minute of normal time as Zaha wriggled his way past three defenders and clipped over his best cross of the night, but the ball evaded both Bolasie and Dann and Villa held on to snatch a priceless three points which propelled them to 12th in the Premier League table.

The defeat pushes the Baggies further into the mire, and heaps the pressure on boss Alan Irvine. The home side had taken the lead just 10 minutes into the game through Craig Dawson; and it seemed to knock the confident Hammers who started the day in fifth.

James Tomkins’ nightmare start was compounded when he was beaten for pace by the recalled Victor Anichebe, and Dawson evaded the visiting defence to head home. But West Brom could not maintain their lively start and the Londoners grew into the game with captain Kevin Nolan getting more involved alongside striker Andy Carroll. It wasn’t long before they levelled and it was through that man Nolan. Just after the half an hour mark, Ben Foster parried Carroll’s bicycle-kick and Nolan headed home. Alan Irvine knows his side need to start getting results quickly. Alan Irvine knows his side need to start getting results quickly. Then on the stroke of half-time, Tomkins redeemed himself to give the Irons the lead, powering in a header from Stewart Downing's corner. Irvine clearly gave his men a talking to as they pushed forward to get an equaliser. Anichebe and England starlet Saido Berahino both had half-chances but failed to trouble Adrian sufficiently. By the end of the game, the home side had four strikers on the pitch including Silvestre Varela who gave Carl Jenkinson a challenge as he sent some probing balls into the box, but Tomkins, Winston Reid and substitute James Collins held firm. The home side eventually made the Londoners' goalkeeper work as Anichebe got himself into some good space but his snapshot was well saved. It looked like they may get a point when the ball fell kindly to Dorrans on the edge of the penalty area. He could only direct his shot wide of the post before the final chance of the game fell to first-half scorer, Dawson, but his volley was well blocked as the Hammers held on.

The champions claimed all three points despite seeing France international Eliaquim Mangala dismissed with 15 minutes remaining at St Mary’s after the centre-back picked up a second yellow card for a foul on substitute Shane Long. Frank Lampard and Gael Clichy feel that team spirit was the key to City’s victory over Southampton Frank Lampard and Gael Clichy feel that team spirit was the key to City’s victory over Southampton However, second-half goals by Yaya Toure, substitute Frank Lampard and left-back Gael Clichy allowed City to cut the gap on Chelsea at the top of the table to just six points after the Blues were held at Sunderland on Saturday. Despite the first half ending goalless, the visitors would have been aggrieved not to have led at the break after in-form striker Sergio Aguero was brought down in the box by Jose Fonte just nine minutes in - only for referee Mike Jones to book the Argentinian for diving. Both sides also had great chances to break the deadlock in an evenly contested opening 45 minutes, but firstly Saints frontman Graziano Pelle failed to beat City keeper Joe Hart from just six yards out. Manuel Pellegrini felt going down to 10 men actually helped Man City as it encouraged Southampton to attack more Manuel Pellegrini felt going down to 10 men actually helped Man City as it encouraged Southampton to attack more And then when City forward Stevan Jovetic was played through on goal on the half-hour mark, Saints No. 1 Fraser Forster half kept the Montenegrin's effort out, before centre-back Toby Alderweireld produced a last-gasp goal-line clearance to complete the job, and keep the scoreline level at half-time. However, Saints head coach Ronald Koeman was forced to make an enforced switch at the break after Morgan Schneiderlin picked up a calf injury in the first period, with the Dutchman opting to move Alderweireld forward from his position at the heart of the Southampton back four into a holding midfield role. City, though, were the team to score the crucial first goal after man-of-the-match Aguero pulled the ball back for the onrushing Toure to fire home through a crowd of players from the edge of the penalty area. Ronald Koeman says Southampton were made to pay for making mistakes against a team of Man City's quality Ronald Koeman says Southampton were made to pay for making mistakes against a team of Man City's quality And while the powerful Ivorian's 51st-minute opener may have taken a slight deflection off Alderweireld before flying past a helpless Forster, the home team could have no such complaints when City doubled their lead with only 10 minutes remaining on the south coast. By that point of the match, Mangala had already received his marching orders for hauling down Long as the Republic of Ireland international ran through on goal, with spaces suddenly created for City's forward-thinking players to exploit on the counterattack. And that is exactly what happened late on as the hard-working Aguero found Lampard with time and space on the edge of the Saints box, before the veteran midfielder fired low into the corner of the net past a flat-footed Forster. Meanwhile, Clichy added a slightly flattering third after 88 minutes when that man Aguero again unselfishly picked out his unmarked team-mate at the back post, with the Frenchman scoring his first-ever goal for the club with a simple finish. JAMIE CARRAGHER'S VERDICT There is no one better who we have seen over the last 10-20 years in terms of that position of coming on to a ball than Lampard. Jamie Carragher says Man City should do all they can to keep Frank Lampard Jamie Carragher says Man City should do all they can to keep Frank Lampard I think he is only one Premier League goal now behind Thierry Henry – that is an unbelievable stat for a central midfield player, and City have to keep him.

"Tottenham staged a superb first-half comeback as they came from behind to beat Everton 2-1 at White Hart Lane on Sunday. Kevin Mirallas put the visitors in front inside the opening quarter of an hour with a stunning curling effort, but Christian Eriksen levelled things seven minutes later before Roberto Soldado completed the turnaround in first-half stoppage time with a cool finish. Seamus Coleman was denied by Hugo Lloris as the visitors searched for an equaliser in the second half, but the hosts held on to halt Everton’s five-game unbeaten run in the Premier League. Man-of-the-match Harry Kane and Jan Vertonghen feel that Tottenham showed character Man-of-the-match Harry Kane and Jan Vertonghen feel that Tottenham showed character Both sides made plenty of changes after their midweek triumphs in the Europa League, with Mauricio Pochettino adding five new faces from the 1-0 win over Partizan Belgrade as Federico Fazio, Nabil Bentaleb, Ryan Mason, Christian Eriksen and Harry Kane all returned. Everton, meanwhile, welcomed Leighton Baines back from a hamstring injury, while Gareth Barry and Ross Barkley also returned to Roberto Martinez’s starting XI in three changes from their 2-0 victory over Wolfsburg. Tottenham have made a habit of letting in early goals, and Pochettino’s men conceded inside 15 minutes for the sixth time this season after Vlad Chiriches gave away a free kick near the edge of the box. Baines’ delivery was cleared but only as far as Mirallas, who cut inside his man before unleashing a superb curling shot which flew past Hugo Lloris and into the far corner. Martinez: A harsh result Martinez: A harsh result Spurs heads didn’t drop, however, and they were soon back on level terms as new fans’ favourite Harry Kane tried to get the hosts back on level terms with a low shot from the edge of the box. Howard saved the youngster’s effort but could only parry it into the path of Eriksen, who sent the ball back across the goal and into the far corner. The hosts were buoyed by the equaliser and looked far more assertive in midfield than the visitors, who have only kept two clean sheets in their last 22 Premier League visits to London. The turnaround was complete before the break as Gareth Barry was caught in possession by Kane and Aaron Lennon played the ball into the path of Soldado, who coolly fired low into the net to score his first Premier League goal in nine months. The hosts continued to dominate after the break, and Martinez threw on Leon Osman – who netted in their last Premier League outing – as well as Aiden McGeady as he looked to get back on level terms. Coleman had a glorious opportunity saved as he was played through in the box from a wonderful Ross Barkley pass, but the defender’s dinked effort was diverted behind by Lloris. Both sides had penalty shouts late on as the ball hit Federico Fazio's arm off Romelu Lukaku's header before Muhamed Besic barged Kane over at the other end, but neither was given and Spurs closed the game out to register their third win in eight days. Gary Neville, Jamie Carragher and Glenn Hoddle assess Harry Kane's performance against Everton Gary Neville, Jamie Carragher and Glenn Hoddle assess Harry Kane's performance against Everton GLENN HODDLE'S VERDICT \"I think [Harry Kane] has done a job coming back for the team and dropping in defensively, but it’s helped them offensively because when he won it he had the energy to run at people. \"He likes to run with his head up, and I think he’s got a bit of calmness about him. Once he’s created a bit of space he comes off on the energy side of things and he’s just got that little calm moment, and he’ll pick the right pass, put the right cross in or get a finish him himself.

The striker scored his seventh goal for the club and first since mid-October when he beat his marker to power home Santi Cazorla’s cross on 60 minutes. Arsene Wenger’s side, who sealed their first victory in three Premier League games, had a string of chances to take a first-half lead, with Welbeck going closest. West Brom only came to life in the last 15 minutes and Saido Berahino had their best chance to equalise when he headed against the crossbar late on. Welbeck: impressed in front of England manager Roy Hodgson Welbeck returned from injury after missing the midweek Champions League victory over Borussia Dortmund, as Olivier Giroud made his first league start of the season and Laurent Koscielny also returned. And the former Manchester United striker looked lively from a wide-right position, latching on to Cazorla's neat pass midway through the first half only to see his shot well saved by Ben Foster. Soon after the keeper was robbed by Giroud, only for the striker's cross shot to fly across the face of an empty goal. The visitors were guilty of trying to be too precise but were being granted too much space by the Albion midfield as they tried to pick their way through. And Foster was needed a number of times in the opening period to deny Cazorla and Alexis Sanchez, but his team failed to test opposite number Damian Martinez before the break and struggled to threaten at all in the final third. Arsenal suffered another injury when Nacho Monreal was forced off and replaced by Kieran Gibbs but they stayed in command in the second half, taking the lead after a brilliant run and cross from Cazorla. Arsenal fans: a section of the support is unhappy with their manager It was all the Gunners deserved and they remained in their comfort zone with little to concern them until the final 10 minutes when Albion mounted a muted rally. West Brom have won just once at home all season and Berahino's late header against the goalframe was the only time they truly threatened. The final whistle came as a relief to the Arsenal manager on a day when a banner in the visiting fans' stand was calling for him to leave - 'Arsene - thanks for the memories, but it's time to say goodbye' - with Gunners fans still frustrated with their team.

a point for Burnley A late Danny Ings penalty helped Burnley grab a share of the spoils in an entertaining 1-1 draw against Aston Villa at Turf Moor. The Clarets were thankful to Ings' fourth goal in five Premier League matches late in the game after Joe Cole handed Villa the lead. Villa looked to be on course for their first win in nine games when Cole grabbed his first top flight goal on the season on his first start for the club in the first half. The former England International slotted home Andreas Weimann's sliderule pass seven minutes before the break. But Jores Okore dragged down Lukas Jutkiewicz in the area for a penalty late on in the game and Ings made no mistake from the spot for the equaliser. Ashley Barnes: Battles for the ball with Carlos Sanchez Burnley were looking to make it three wins in a row in the top flight for the first time in almost 40 years and Ings could have scored his fifth goal in five games but hit the post in stoppage-time. Cole was at the heart of things straight away, linking up well with Gabriel Agbonlahor, Andreas Weimann and Tom Cleverley. Villa almost went ahead inside five minutes, with Agbonlahor's deflected shot earning a corner from which Dean Marney headed smartly off the line after Jores Okore's poked effort had spun towards the top corner off Keane. Burnley looked particularly vulnerable from Ashley Westwood's corners, and Marney was on hand again shortly afterwards with a vital block when Ciaran Clark got his head to another inswinger. The Clarets struggled to clear their lines but, when they did, they looked dangerous on the break and Carlos Sanchez had to be alert to stop Ings running through on goal from his own half. Michael Kightly also threatened after a smart turn in the area fooled Villa but his shot just missed the far post. Agbonlahor was finding lots of space and should have done better in the 19th minute when he was cleverly played in by Cole but shot tamely at Tom Heaton. The former England man was at the heart of everything and it was fitting he should be the man to open the scoring. A misplaced Burnley header played in Weimann down the right and his smart pass was turned in at the near post by Cole, who was definitely onside despite the protests of the home side. Ings was Burnley's brightest spark and he tested Brad Guzan with a fierce shot after a fine piece of control on the edge of the area. Joe Cole: Scored the opening goal of the game Ashley Barnes came even closer in injury time with a header against the far post but referee Graham Scott, taking charge of his first Premier League game, errantly ruled the ball had come off his hand and then showed Barnes a yellow card for his protests. Burnley continued to push for an equaliser early in the second half, with George Boyd seeing a tame shot blocked and then Kightly doing superbly to break through the Villa defence only for Guzan to pull off an excellent save, with the ball cleared from in front of the line. Paul Lambert felt his Aston Villa side dominated the game against Burnley Paul Lambert felt his Aston Villa side dominated the game against Burnley The game remained open, and it was Heaton showing good reactions in the 57th minute to block an effort from Weimann. Burnley boss Sean Dyche made a double substitution with 25 minutes to go, sending on Lukas Jutkiewicz and Scott Arfield for Barnes and Kightly. Jutkiewicz almost made an instant impact but Kieran Trippier's dangerous free-kick just evaded the big striker in front of goal. Sean Dyche was left wondering how his Burnley side didn’t beat Aston Villa Sean Dyche was left wondering how his Burnley side didn’t beat Aston Villa Cole's afternoon also came to an early end, Jack Grealish the man replacing him, but the midfielder had certainly more than justified his place in the side. The game looked to be petering out until a ball over the top caught out Okore, who clumsily brought down Jutkiewicz in the box. The Villa defender was fortunate only to be shown a yellow card but Ings exacted the main punishment by lashing the penalty high into the net in the 87th-minute. Burnley had the better of a frantic finish, with Ings and Jutkiewicz both missing great chances, while Villa will also feel they could have won it after Grealish shot straight at Heaton.

ended a run of three straight Premier League defeats as Glen Johnson's late header gave them a 1-0 win over Stoke after a nervy encounter at Anfield on Saturday. Johnson reacted quickest to a Rickie Lambert header which hit the bar, after the visitors went close on numerous occasions, with Bojan Krkic hitting the post and Mame Biram Diouf denied by Raheem Sterling’s clearance. After a drab opening 45 minutes, the game opened up massively and both sides spurned some superb opportunities. Lucas and Joe Allen both missed chances inside the box, while Bojan drew a spectacular stop from Simon Mignolet in stoppage time. But the hosts held off some late Stoke pressure to record their first win in November and alleviate some of the pressure mounting on manager Brendan Rodgers. Mark Hughes has blamed his Stoke side for switching off in the defeat to Liverpool Mark Hughes has blamed his Stoke side for switching off in the defeat to Liverpool Rodgers rested captain Steven Gerrard on the 16th anniversary of his debut for the club, with Philippe Coutinho coming in, while Kolo Toure was given the nod ahead of Dejan Lovren in central defence and Jose Enrique started in place of Alberto Moreno. Stoke, meanwhile, were without Victor Moses after the winger was injured against Burnley, so Marko Arnautovic filled in on the left wing. Mark Hughes also made two changes at the back, with Marc Wilson and Erik Pieters coming in. The crowd were left frustrated in the opening 45 minutes as Liverpool failed to impose themselves in the middle of the park, even after Stoke had to withdraw Steve Sidwell early on, with the midfielder failing to recover from a 50-50 challenge with Rickie Lambert. Glenn Whelan, who replaced the injured Sidwell, had to be withdrawn himself at the break and Charlie Adam was introduced against his former club. The midfielder almost had an effect straight away, but at the wrong end as he gave the ball straight to Sterling before recovering to cut out his pass for Lambert. Lambert's header led to Johnson's winner Moments later Henderson, who was captain in place of Gerrard, drilled a volley inches wide as Liverpool started to find their feet. Rodgers’ men were almost caught out at the other end as Bojan found Diouf in behind and, with Mignolet electing not to come out, the striker tested the goalkeeper for the first time in the match, forcing a low save from the Liverpool shot-stopper. Gerrard was benched by Rodgers Things continued to open up, and Bojan flew in from the left before drilling a shot against the near post, then moments later Sterling dragged a left-footed effort inches wide. Sterling was involved again as he intercepted Arnautovic’s pass and Liverpool momentarily had five against three. The winger played in Lucas, but the Brazilian’s lack of goals shone through as he drilled his shot straight at Begovic. Brendan Rodgers is hoping the 1-0 victory over Stoke will help get confidence back into his squad Brendan Rodgers is hoping the 1-0 victory over Stoke will help get confidence back into his squad Allen then spooned a close-range shot over after some neat play from Coutinho and Sterling as the hosts just couldn’t find the back of the net, while Stoke looked like they would rue their missed chances. Mark Hughes must have thought it wouldn’t be his side’s day when a corner fell to Diouf six yards out, but his shot on the turn was blocked on the line by Sterling. Just a couple of minutes later the deadlock was finally broken, and Gerrard was inevitably involved in the build-up. The midfielder’s cross was met by Lambert, who powered a header against the crossbar and Johnson reacted quickest, charging in to head the ball low into the net. It was a huge blow for Stoke, who would have felt they could have taken all three points, but they couldn’t get back on level terms despite some late pressure inside the Liverpool half. Soccer Saturday reaction - Charlie Nicholas Charlie Nicholas reflects on the game Charlie Nicholas reflects on the game I didn’t think Liverpool deserved it. Stoke were worthy of something from the game. It’s about the three points for Liverpool – but Mark Hughes will think his side should have won this game, never mind got a point. I thought Stoke were pretty good today. Not a great deal happened in the first half; Stoke’s shape was good and Liverpool didn’t really hurt them. But the second half exploded. Charlie Adam has got a beautiful left foot but he’s not really a holding player, he doesn’t have the discipline, and that meant the game started to spread and there was a lot of space. Everything that was good from Liverpool came through Sterling but it was Johnson who got the winner with about five minutes to go, heading in after Lambert’s header had come back off the crossbar. Bojan was much, much better in the second half and had smashed one against the post after skipping past a couple of players. If he’d just been more clinical with his final pass in the first half then it would have opened up – and if Stoke had scored first they’d have won this match.

The home side surprised many by switching to a flat back four from the three-man defence they utilised in their 2-1 win at Arsenal last weekend. But that change had no impact on United's fluency as they dominated proceedings right from the kick-off, and it was no real surprise when centre-back Smalling gave them a 16th-minute lead following a Juan Mata corner on the left. Tony Pulis says Manchester United were in total control of their 3-0 win over Hull Tony Pulis says Manchester United were in total control of their 3-0 win over Hull The England international reacted quickest after seeing his initial header at the back post palmed away by Allan McGregor in the Tigers goal, before poking the ball over a crowded goal-line. However, it still needed referee Anthony Taylor to consult his watch before being given the go-ahead to award the goal, with TV replays subsequently confirming that the whole of the ball had indeed just crossed the goal-line. And despite United losing influential playmaker Angel di Maria early on to a hamstring problem – the 42nd injury that the Red Devils have picked up already so far this campaign – they still managed to double their lead three minutes before half-time through in-form striker Rooney. Rooney continued his fine scoring form against Hull The move was started by Mata and when the ball was eventually worked to the England skipper some 20 yards out from goal after good build-up play from both substitute Ander Herrera and Van Persie, Rooney side-footed past McGregor. And that goal by Rooney was his seventh in just five matches against Hull, while United's captain also now has an impressive 67 strikes inhis last 101 Premier League contests at Old Trafford. Louis van Gaal was impressed with the way his Manchester United dominated the game Louis van Gaal was impressed with the way his Manchester United dominated the game Meanwhile for the visitors, the second half was simply a case of damage limitation after an opening 45 minutes in which United No. 1 David de Gea did not have a single shot on target to deal with. However, hard as they tried, the north-east outfit struggled to carve out many meaningful openings after the break, apart from a Nikica Jelavic header that flew narrowily off target. For the home team, though, the icing on the cake came midway through the second period when the previously misfiring Van Persie finally ended his recent goal drought, and in some style too after the Dutchman rifled home an unstoppable finish from the left-hand corner of the penalty area. Steve Bruce was left disappointed by the way his Hull side gifted goals Steve Bruce was left disappointed by the way his Hull side gifted goals Van Persie had scored only eight goals in 21 league games this year heading into this afternoon's encounter, down from 19 in 29 in 2013, and while the forward is still some way off the levels he displayed in his memorable debut campaign at the Theatre of Dreams, finding the back of the net in such style today may now see him retrurn to his normally deadly best in front of goal. The Red Devils even had time to reintroduce Radamel Falcao into the fray for the final 20 minutes following a recent layoff with a calf injury, with the Colombian goal machine coming on for Van Persie. And as for Van Gaal's rapidly evolving United team, that is three straight top-flight wins for the first time since December, while for Steve Bruce and Hull a long hard season clearly awaits.

Harry Redknapp described QPR's 3-2 win over Leicester as a great game Harry Redknapp described QPR's 3-2 win over Leicester as a great game Charlie Austin headed in the winner on 73 minutes - his seventh league goal of the season - after the Foxes failed to clear from an umpteenth Rangers corner. The hosts had to come from behind in the first half, drawing level from Wes Morgan’s own goal after Esteban Cambiasso fired the Foxes into a fourth-minute lead. Leroy Fer blasted Rangers into the lead just before the break before Jeffrey Schlupp equalised early in the second half from distance. Leicester manager Nigel Pearson thinks there were positives to take from the loss Leicester manager Nigel Pearson thinks there were positives to take from the loss Lively Leicester striker Jamie Vardy could also have scored with a glancing header that rattled the crossbar before Austin's winner. But a sixth league defeat in eight games means Nigel Pearson’s side drop to the foot of the table themselves and they will feel hard-done-by after a good performance. Cambiasso steered in his first league goal for the club from 18 yards and both Vardy and Leonardo Ulloa had chances to find a second before Morgan’s mistake gifted Rangers a way back in. Poor marking from the away side allowed Fer to power home his first goal for the club from close-range but Leicester were deservedly back in the game on 67 minutes when Schlupp found the bottom corner. However, yet more indecisive defending caused a melee in the box that saw Nedum Onuoha's shot blocked by keeper Kasper Schmeichel and bounce up for Austin to nod easily into the corner. Matty James had Leicester's best chance for a late equaliser but he volleyed just over the crossbar in stoppage time.

for Palace Swansea City missed the opportunity to climb the table as Mile Jedinak's first-half penalty rescued a point for Crystal Palace in a 1-1 draw at the Liberty Stadium. Wilfried Bony’s 15th-minute strike had handed the hosts a well-earned lead but Jedinak, who entered the field with a cricket bat and cap in a mark of respect to the late Australian cricketer Phillip Hughes, levelled proceedings to grab a point for his side. Swansea started the day in seventh place with manager Garry Monk saying the next nine games would define their season - whether they could make a challenge for a European place or be looking over their shoulder at the teams below them. Merson: Gayle injury changed game Merson: Gayle injury changed game The game appeared to be a formality in the opening exchanges with Swansea applying a sustained onslaught on the Palace area in a dominant opening spell. It took Swansea just a matter of minutes to get into their usual rhythm of possession football and, undeterred after having a penalty appeal waved away by Martin Atkinson when Neil Taylor went down in the area, Jefferson Montero and Wayne Routledge caused mayhem down Palace's flanks. Bony twice went close as the Swans looked to open the scoring and Gylfi Sigurdsson sent over an angled free-kick before the home side took a deserved 15th minute lead. After a series of spurned opportunities, Swansea's in-form striker duely obliged, with Bony coolly slotting past Julian Speroni in the Palace goal after he turned and swivelled at the edge of the box following Sigurdsson’s neat interplay. Wilfried Bony of Swansea City celebrates with Gylfi Sigurdsson as he opens the scoring It was the Ivorian's 18th Premier League goal of the calendar year - the best record in the division. It seemed a matter of time before Swansea would build on their lead but the game turned just over 10 minutes later when, against the run of play, the visitors ventured forward for the first time though Yannick Bolasie, with the Congo international winning the first in a succession of corners. Jonjo Shelvey - recalled into the starting XI in place of loan signing Tom Carroll - got on the wrong side of Marouane Chamakh in a congested penalty area after the second corner and the Palace forward fell to the floor. Referee Atkinson adjudged the England midfielder to have fouled the Moroccan and pointed to the spot, thereby giving the visitors an unlikely route back into a game in which they had been outplayed for the most part. Jedinak stepped up and fired straight down the middle to draw his side level, with the equaliser appearing to turn the tide and give Palace a foothold in the game, while also acting to dampen the promising start the Swans had made to the game. Swansea manager Garry Monk and Palace boss Neil Warnock share a joke prior to kick-off Bolasie finally got into the game and linked up with Chamakh - who was lucky to stay on the pitch after a succession of repetitive fouls and a handball - as Palace ended the half noticeably better than which they started it. Chamakh went into referee Atkinson's book for scything down Neil Taylor and he was perhaps fortunate to still be on the field as he had escaped a blatant show of dissent in the opening stages when throwing the ball down in disgust at the award of a Swansea free-kick. Neil Warnock was happy with how Crystal Palace recovered in their 1-1 draw against Swansea after describing their opening play as chaotic and as bad as he' Neil Warnock was happy with how Crystal Palace recovered in their 1-1 draw against Swansea after describing their opening play as chaotic and as bad as he' Bolasie clipped the Swansea crossbar from 20 yards with referee Martin Atkinson adjudicating that Fabianski had got a touch on it - but Palace were sent a warning that the threat from the home side was not over. Slick passing play between Bony and Sigurdsson opened up the space for Routledge to run through unattended but his left-foot shot lacked power and Speroni saved comfortably. The Moroccan still emerged for the second half despite the fact he was walking a very thin line and Palace were encouraged by Jedinak firing at Fabianski and Bolasie having his shot deflected wide. Mile Jedinak converted from the spot to equalise for Crystal Palace but Swansea manager Garry Monk felt that the penalty was inconclusive. Mile Jedinak converted from the spot to equalise for Crystal Palace but Swansea manager Garry Monk felt that the penalty was inconclusive. Swansea had wrestled control back for the most part but openings were not too forthcoming, although Sigurdsson's effort 12 minutes from time was too close to the far post for Palace's comfort. Sigurdsson was the most likely player to grab a winner but when he blazed over after taking Angel Rangel's pass Palace's point was secure. It was Palace’s resilience in defence, and their ability to prevent Swansea from dominating the game as they had in the first half, which ultimately decided the outcome of the game. Soccer Saturday reaction - Paul Merson \"Swansea started very well and got a great goal by Bony; all in one movement he turned and ‘bang’ put the ball in the corner. It was a great start. But there was a blessing in disguise for Crystal Palace. Gayle got injured and McArthur came on. If that didn’t happen, the game would have been over at half-time. \"They were all over the place. But when James McArthur came on, Chamakh went up front, Palace got more men behind the ball and they were much, much better. That for me was the game changer. I don’t think it was a penalty for the equaliser, though. Chamakh turned, Shelvey didn’t touch him and the ref gave a penalty.

The Hammers full-back scored his first goal for the club, lifting them into fifth in the Premier League table, and Moussa Sissoko's late dismissal capped off a frustrating afternoon for Newcastle at Upton Park on Saturday. Newcastle started with a confident swagger after six straight wins and Ayoze Perez nearly snatched an opener, spinning and shooting past the far post after he was teed up by Yoan Gouffran. Andy Carroll, facing his former club, gave a glimpse of his aerial power with a flick-on and Stewart Downing’s low drive tested Newcastle goalkeeper Rob Elliot. Cresswell: Scored his first goal for West Ham West Ham were settling well, starting to show the slicker brand of football which has propelled them up the table. But Cheikhou Kouyate spoiled a sweeping counter attack with a horribly sliced cross. Starved of possession, Newcastle were reliant on Perez for much of their attacking threat. The Spaniard was denied by a timely tackle from James Tomkins, but then fired into the side netting from a tight angle. West Ham appealed passionately for a penalty just before the break, with Carroll convinced that Mike Williamson had blocked the ball with his arm, but referee Mike Dean was unmoved. Williamson and Jarvis: Battling at Upton Park Downing sent a rising shot over the bar during a frantic start to the second period, while Newcastle’s Jack Colback was equally wayward, ballooning the ball into the crowd. But it was the Hammers who took the lead soon afterwards in scruffy fashion. A mishit shot from Kouyate bounced perfectly into the path of Cresswell (56), who steered his shot into the bottom corner. Newcastle searched for an instant response and Adrian smothered a near post shot from the lively Perez. But an uphill task for the Magpies was made to appear even steeper when Sissoko (76) was sent-off. The French midfielder earned a second yellow with a crunching challenge on Carroll. West Ham were unable to take advantage in the dying minutes as Downing's low cross drifted across the box, while substitute Mauro Zarate was crowded out after bursting clear. Sam Allardyce singled out goalscorer Aaron Cresswell for praise Sam Allardyce singled out goalscorer Aaron Cresswell for praise Soccer Saturday reaction - Matt Le Tissier A draw would have been a fair result. Neither of the sides dominated for great periods of time. Neither of them created a load of chances. The goal was a bit of a fluke as well. Kouyate hit a shot so badly it trickled past the Newcastle defence, it fell into Cresswell’s path and he finished it well. It wasn’t a game of great quality and it was probably appropriate that a goal that wasn’t of great quality settled it. Williamson and Dummett played Carroll very well and kept him quiet. Anything that came into the box, they were very tight on him and didn’t allow him any free headers at goal. They marshalled him pretty well and he was ineffective. Matt Le Tissier didn't think that Newcastle deserved to lose to West Ham but admits it was a poor quality game at Upton Park Matt Le Tissier didn't think that Newcastle deserved to lose to West Ham but admits it was a poor quality game at Upton Park As for Moussa Sissoko’s red card, he got two yellows in about a minute. The first was for kicking the ball away, which was a little silly and seconds later he appears to scrape his studs down Carroll’s shin and push him in the chest. The ref thought that was worthy of a second yellow and he was off. I like the look of Perez. His movement is good up front, he’s always showing for the ball, he’s always lively and he caused a few problems for the West Ham defence. He’s going to be a very good footballer. Newcastle didn’t look like a team that had won six on the bounce, though.

Chelsea failed to score for the first time this season as they were held to a goalless draw by Sunderland on Saturday Night Football. Both sides hit the woodwork in the first half as Willian struck the post with a low shot and Santiago Vergini saw an effort bounce off the bar. Sunderland continued to frustrate the Premier League leaders after the break and held firm to record their third draw in a row. The stalemate sees Chelsea extend their advantage at the top to seven points while Sunderland move up to 13th. Mourinho praises Sunderland defence Mourinho praises Sunderland defence The Black Cats were fully deserving of their point too after an impressive defensive display at the Stadium of Light. While they invited pressure by sitting deep in their own box at times, they always made life difficult for Chelsea and presented them with very few clear chances on goal. The only time they were nearly caught out in the first half was when Chelsea broke swiftly from a free-kick and Willian struck a low shot against the post from just outside the box. Wilian was involved in another decent chance on the half-hour mark after linking up with Branislav Ivanovic on the right. The defender continued his run into the box but saw his effort deflected over the bar by Costel Pantilimon. That, though, was to be Chelsea’s best opening of the half as Sunderland continued to make it difficult for the visitors and started to grow in belief and confidence themselves. Frustration for Costa Frustration for Costa Just moments after Ivanovic’s shot was saved, the hosts spurned a great chance to take the lead when Lee Cattermole's cross from the right was deflected into the box and into the path of Vergini, who hooked the ball over Thibaut Courtouis but on to the bar. The Black Cats continued to hold firm in the second half and perhaps even had the better chances to break the deadlock as Chelsea attacks repeatedly broke down on the edge of the Sunderland box.

Connor Wickham nearly caught Courtouis by surprise with a snap shot before Adam Johnson dragged an effort wide on his wrong foot when he should have at least hit the target from inside the area. The visitors, who saw Diego Costa pick up a booking that will keep him out of the midweek match against Tottenham Hotspur, were largely restricted to long-range shots, but none really tested Pantilimon. Jose Mourinho threw on Loic Remy and Didier Drogba in a bid to force a late winner but Sunderland were still able to snuff out all of Chelsea’s attacks and hold on for a well deserved draw.

While Saints manager Ronald Koeman made just the one change to the side that won against Leicester last time out, Villa were forced into three, all in defence. Alan Hutton, Ciaran Clark and Jores Okore were handed starts, with captain Ron Vlaar, Philippe Senderos and Nathan Baker all out. The defence looked far from make-shift, though, as they restricted Saints to only a handful of opportunities throughout the match. Paul Lambert hailed a 'big point' against high-flying Southampton Paul Lambert hailed a 'big point' against high-flying Southampton While the visitors enjoyed more of the possession in the early stages, they too often wasted it when they got into the final third. Villa didn’t fare much better in front of a sparse crowd at Villa Park but they did give their fans something to cheer about when they took the lead in the 29th minute through Agbonlahor. There looked to be little danger when Clark cleared the ball downfield from midway inside his own half, but some indecision from Forster proved costly. After initially going forward, he went back, before coming out and getting beaten to the ball by Agbonlahor, who finished into an empty net. It was only the sixth goal Saints had conceded in the league this season and they came close to levelling before the break when Brad Guzan dived to his right to palm away a curling effort from Mane.

Ciaran Clark and Gabriel Agbonlahor were disappointed to throw away a 1-0 lead against Southampton at Villa Park. But that was a rare test for the American keeper as Saints, who had won their previous league matches in a row without conceding a goal, continued to struggle to break down a dogged Villa defence. It still didn’t click for them in the second half and they were fortunate not to fall 2-0 behind in the 78th minute when Andreas Weimann fired wastefully over the bar from 10 yards out after a swift counter-attack. Just minutes later the scores were level as Bertrand showed good strength to get away from Weimann down the left and pulled the ball back for his fellow full-back Clyne to finish from the penalty spot.

Helped Palace to memorable win Liverpool endured another forgettable afternoon at Selhurst Park on Sunday as they were beaten 3-1 by Crystal Palace. Brendan Rodgers saw his side make the perfect start, as Rickie Lambert netted inside the opening 90 seconds, but there was to be more pain for the men from Merseyside. Best of the match Man of the match: Yannick Bolasie. Always a threat and had a hand in two of Crystal Palace’s goals. Goal of the match: Mile Jedinak left Simon Mignolet clutching at fresh air as he curled a brilliant free-kick into the top corner. Moment of the match: Liverpool really should have built on their early opener, but instead they allowed Palace to work their way back into the game. Talking point: Will Crystal Palace steer well clear of trouble this season? What next for Brendan Rodgers and his deflated troops? Liverpool saw their title dreams dashed in south London last season, as they squandered a three-goal lead, and they were once again unable to prevent Palace from pegging them back as Dwight Gayle, Joe Ledley and Mile Jedinak found the target. Lambert’s first goal for his boyhood club offered the visitors a dream start, as he was freed by a brilliant pass from Adam Lallana and fired low under Julian Speroni. The hosts grew into the game, though, and drew level on 17 minutes when the lively Yannick Bolasie saw a skidding drive cannon back off the base of the post and Gayle bundle home the rebound. Things got even better for Neil Warnock’s men after the interval, as they clambered out of the Premier League drop zone, with Joe Ledley firing through the legs of Simon Mignolet on 78 minutes and Jedinak curling a spectacular free-kick into the top corner nine minutes from time. Memorable Dwight Gayle: Lively display and equalising goal Palace scored three times in the last 11 minutes at Selhurst Park last season to record a memorable 3-3 draw and all-but end Liverpool's title hopes - leaving Luis Suarez in tears. That fixture came on the back of a home defeat to Chelsea and, just like the back-end of last campaign, Rodgers' side could not respond with a win in the capital. Mario Balotelli was ruled out with a groin injury having yet to make much of an impact since moving to Anfield. He is still searching for his first Premier League goal but it was his replacement Lambert who achieved his own landmark early on. The boyhood Liverpool fan was on hand to gather a pinpoint pass from his fellow former Southampton favourite Lallana to net his first goal for the club since his summer move. Rickie Lambert: Dream start, but Liverpool faded badly Being on the pitch at such an early stage is not something Lambert has been accustomed to, with this just his second league start of the season, but the England international has now staked his claim to stay in Rodgers' side. The Reds have not won in the league since a late 3-2 victory at QPR over a month ago, but flew out of the blocks at a wet Selhurst Park as Lambert collected Lallana's pass and slotted home past Julian Speroni with aplomb to finally break his Liverpool duck with just 90 seconds on the clock. Enthralling Dwight Gayle came off the bench to grab two of the goals in the enthralling draw last season and it was the former Peterborough man who was on hand to equalise for the Eagles. Brendan Rodgers believes that his Liverpool team must stick together Brendan Rodgers believes that his Liverpool team must stick together Bolasie picked the ball up and was allowed to canter into the Liverpool half unchallenged before his fierce drive came off the post and into the path of Gayle, whose shot was too strong for Mignolet to keep out. Lambert could not hit the target with two headers either side of another arrowed shot from Bolasie that forced Mignolet into a smart save. He was the man causing all of the problems for Liverpool, who were caught on the counter-attack by the blistering pace of the Congo international before he exchanged passes with Jason Puncheon and saw his shot blocked behind by Javier Manquillo. The Spanish defender had no answer to Bolasie moments later but this time the Palace winger could only hammer his shot wide as the first half ended with the sides level.

There were no clear chances in the early stages of the second half with neither side really creating enough in the final third. Impact Steven Gerrard, who had little impact on much of the proceedings, could only hammer a free-kick into the stands before Manquillo side-footed a chance from inside the area out for a Palace throw-in. Rodgers reacted to his side's lack of cutting edge by introducing Fabio Borini and Emre Can in place of Lallana and Joe Allen. Crystal Palace manager was full of praise for his side after they beat Liverpool 3-1. Crystal Palace manager was full of praise for his side after they beat Liverpool 3-1. But it was the hosts who were celebrating the lead soon after and it was fitting that Bolasie was once again at the centre of the move. The undoubted man of the match flicked the ball over Dejan Lovren's head and, having left the Croatian sprawled, crossed for Ledley to calmly finish and turn the game on its head. The points were secured shortly afterwards as Martin Skrtel felled Gayle 30 yards from goal and Eagles skipper Jedinak, returning to the side following a one-match ban, curled in a beautiful free-kick. Liverpool could not mount the kind of comeback that saw Palace snatch a point here in amazing circumstances six months ago and remain 18 points behind leaders Chelsea with just 12 games gone, with the Eagles two points further back."},{"date": "23/11/2015", "arena": "KCOM Stadium", "attendance": 23561, "home_team": {"name": "Hull City", "lineup": [{"name": "Allan McGregor", "yellows": [], "reds":

Diego Costa set Chelsea on their way with the opener and the impressive Eden Hazard added a second to secure the win for Jose Mourinho's side as they set a new club record of 12 matches unbeaten from the start of a top-flight season. West Brom were forced to play for an hour with just 10 men after Claudio Yacob, who was making his first Premier League start of the season, was sent off for a reckless challenge on Costa. Best of the game Man of the match: Eden Hazard proved a constant threat to the West Brom defence and got on the scoresheet. Goal of the match: Diego Costa controlled Oscar's pass before volleying past Ben Foster for his 11th Premier League goal of the season Save of the match: Foster was overworked in the West Brom goal and he produced a fine save to keep out Oscar's swerving shot and then Costa's follow up effort Moment of the match: Claudio Yacob's red card ended the match as a contest as West Brom were forced to play for over an hour with 10 man already two goals down Talking point: Can Chelsea go the whole season unbeaten? Will West Brom find themselves in a relegation battle? Chelsea came flying out of the blocks and went close to opening the scoring after just five minutes when West Brom were caught napping from a corner as Cesc Fabregas found John Terry inside the six-yard box and his close-range shot was brilliantly saved by the feet of Ben Foster. The home side broke the deadlock on 11 minutes with top scorer Costa netting his 11th Premier League goal in just ten games. Eden Hazard scored Chelsea's second goal as they stretched their unbeaten start to 12 Premier League games Eden Hazard scored Chelsea's second goal as they stretched their unbeaten start to 12 Premier League games Oscar picked out Costa inside the box and as the West Brom defenders appealed for offside the striker chested the ball down before volleying it past Foster from close range. Foster came to West Brom's rescue on 15 minutes when he produced a fine one-handed save to keep out Oscar's swerving shot from the edge of the box and the keeper showed great reaction to prevent Costa scoring from the rebound. Costa should have made it 2-0 on 19 minutes when he got in front of his marker to get on the end of Branislav Ivanovic's cross from the right, but the normall deadly striker slid his shot wide of the far post. Chelsea did double their lead on 25 minutes as they again caught West Brom sleeping from a quickly taken corner as Fabregas found Hazard unmarked inside the box and the Belgian fired his deflected shot past Foster at his near post. Things got worse for West Brom just before the half hour mark when Yacob was shown a straight red card by referee Lee Mason for a reckless two-footed tackle on Costa on the edge of the box. It was all one-way traffic for the remainder of the first half with Foster working overtime to stop Costa scoring from Hazard's pass and then getting back to his feet quickly to stop Oscar latching onto the loose ball to score. Chelsea picked up where they left off at the start of the second half and they really should have made it 3-0 seconds after the restart when Nemanja Matic ghosted into the box unmarked to get on the end of Hazard's pass, but with only Foster to beat the Serbian volleyed his shot over the crossbar. Jose Mourinho was full of praise for the Chelsea fans and their support after his side beat West Brom 2-0 Jose Mourinho was full of praise for the Chelsea fans and their support after his side beat West Brom 2-0 The home side were in total control in the second half and it was a case of damage limitation for West Brom as they defended deep to frustrate Chelsea. Foster denied Chelsea a third goal on 73 minutes when he rushed quickly off his line to block Hazard's shot with his feet after Fabregas had picked out the Belgian with a superb slide-rule pass. Chelsea played out the closing stages with ease as they made it six straight wins at Stamford Bridge in the Premier League to further strengthen their grip at the top of the table.

With the sending off after about half an hour of Yacob, it became Chelsea controlling the ball. It was routine. Ben Foster has had a magnificent game – but the two goals they conceded could have been prevented. For the first one, Costa was offside, but he was on his own. And the second one is similar, it is laid back to Hazard who is by the six-yard box who has time – awful defending. \"Diego Costa did very well. He’s gone up in my estimation again. He went up for the ball with Craig Dawson, who caught him with his arm. There’s blood on the side of his shirt, but he comes back on, and acknowledged it as a fair challenge. But the man of the match was Ben Foster. He was superb. He made so many saves in this match. He was magnificent. \"There’s still a long way to go and bigger clubs will come to town.

Romelu Lukaku opened the scoring for Everton in the first half with Osman's 73rd-minute strike sandwiching a West Ham reply by Mauro Zarate. Best of the game Man of the match: Leon Osman, rounding off his 400th appearance for the Toffees with the winning goal in the second half. Attempt of the match: James McCarthy’s long-range shot in the second half fizzed just over the bar. Save of the match: Adrian made a smart stop with his legs when it looked easier for James Collins to score from around five yards out. Talking point: Never nice to highlight an embarrassing dive, but Ross Barkley throwing himself to the ground when not even touched by Kevin Nolan should be addressed. Goal of the match: With the other two goals rather scrappy, Osman’s winner takes the honour and it was great work from the vastly-experienced Samuel Eto’o to set him up, not to mentioned some excellent refereeing by Mark Clattenburg to wave ‘play on’ in the build-up. The win takes Everton up to 17 points in the Premier League, one behind West Ham, who started the day in fourth place. In the 26th minute, Ross Barkley cleverly controlled a headed pass from Naismith to wrongfoot a defender but, as he shaped to strike the ball, it was blocked. The wild deflection fell kindly to Lukaku, in space on the left of the six-yard box, and the Belgium international calmly gave West Ham’s Spanish keeper Adrian little chance as he swept it in for the opening goal. Everton boss Roberto Martinez declared himself extremely satisfied with victory over West Ham Everton boss Roberto Martinez declared himself extremely satisfied with victory over West Ham Eleven minutes later Lukaku put the ball in the back of the net for a second time but was ruled off-side. In the second half, Argentine striker Zarate, who had only just come on for West Ham as a substitute, picked the ball up on the right in the 56th minute, ran across the top of the Everton box and fired through several defenders. The ball hit Jagielka’s out-stretched leg and took a big deflection over the advancing Tim Howard, who could do nothing to prevent the ball looping high over his head and into the net for the equaliser. James McCarthy went close for Everton three minutes later after running at James Tomkins, cutting inside and curling a beautiful shot just past the far corner of the goal. Close Sam Allardyce was annoyed with the officialsafter Everton's opening goal was allowed to stand Sam Allardyce was annoyed with the officialsafter Everton's opening goal was allowed to stand The decisive goal came in the 73rd minute after Lukaku broke quickly over the half-way line and James Collins took him out. Ref Mark Clattenburg played an excellent advantage and Samuel Eto’o, on as a substitute for Kevin Mirallas, collected the ball to thread a perfect ball across the box to Osman racing in on the far side. And midfielder Osman made no mistake to put Everton back in front with his second goal of the season. Moments later Howard kept Everton in front with a point-blank save with his legs from Collins. In the dying minutes Osman and Eto'o again combined with a wonderful one-two on the edge of the West Ham box, Osman pulling it back in front of the goal only for the Cameroon international to hit it hard - but wide. Paul Merson Paul Merson said Sam Allardyce will feel disappointed with the result, despite West Ham having a lot injuries. Paul Merson said Sam Allardyce will feel disappointed with the result, despite West Ham having a lot injuries. I was quite impressed with West Ham. With the amount of injuries they had, they did alright. You take five players out for a team like West Ham and send them to Everton and you think they’d get done, but they were really good. Lukaku might have been offside for Everton's first goal, the equaliser. I think he got lucky. But then West Ham were very good, moved the ball quickly and put crosses in and put Everton under pressure.

Adam Johnson says Sunderland will be looking to continue their unbeaten run throughout the coming weeks. Sunderland, ultimately, had the best chance of the game - Steven Fletcher was brilliantly denied by Kasper Schmeichel in what passed as the match's best opportunity to score. The hosts roared into a bright beginning, almost aided by a terrible Wes Brown error in the sixth minute. His slip allowed Jamie Vardy through on goal but as he tried to round Costel Pantilimon, the Sunderland goalkeeper forced him wide. Leicester City boss Nigel Pearson was full of praise for the effort of his Leicester players Leicester City boss Nigel Pearson was full of praise for the effort of his Leicester players After Leicester failed to make their dominant start count for anything, Fletcher missed the clearest chance of the afternoon. With just Schmeichel to beat, the keeper burst off his line and smothered the Scottish striker's effort. The visitors will have been disappointed to go into the break level. Adam Johnson whipped a 30-yard shot that skimmed off the wet surface and brought the best out of Schmeichel before Seb Larsson was denied by a committed Wes Morgan block.

Fletcher again missed a good chance - a corner was drilled into his feet but he wildly blasted it over. Mahrez, meanwhile, increased the volume of the home crowd with his every touch. The Algerian could have had a penalty for handball when John O'Shea blocked his shot but would come even closer soon after. Elusive skill inside the box left two Sunderland defenders behind but Mahrez's shot was turned behind by Pantilimon. It was clear his luck was out when, running through on goal and taking the ball expertly on his chest, he was grounded by Anthony Reveillere but the referee wasn't interested. Wes Morgan has called on the whole Leicester team to help end their goalscoring drought Wes Morgan has called on the whole Leicester team to help end their goalscoring drought As both sides toiled for the opening goal, tensions were raised typically by Lee Cattermole's competitiveness. He flew in on Esteban Cambiasso, drawing a yellow card although Leicester demanded more, before Larsson escaped a second booking further annoying the hosts. Matty James, in Leicester's midfield, did his best to muster a goal with a clever one-two but a feeble shot at the keeper wasn't enough. Nigel Pearson was proactive in thrusting his men forward by introducing Anthony Knockaert and Chris Wood in the last 10 minutes but it was too little, too late.

Pressure has been on Manuel Pellegrini’s during a poor run of late in all competitions, and they had to dig deep to find a seventh Premier League win of the season. The pressure was ramped up when Dyer flicked the ball over the back-four to release Bony, who controlled brilliantly on his chest and caressed home the opener.

Moussa Sissoko netted the only goal of the game for Alan Pardew’s in-form side, on an afternoon in which it appeared for long periods as though an international break hangover would deliver a goalless stalemate. Best of the match Man of the match: Moussa Sissoko. Lively throughout and netted the all-important match winner. Sad sight of the match: Ryan Taylor left the field in tears after appearing to pick up yet another knee injury. Moment of the match: There are not too many away grounds that welcome the sight of Joey Barton, but he was given a warm reception by the St James’ Park faithful. Talking point: Can Newcastle keep their winning run going? Have QPR got enough to steer clear of trouble? In fact, the only incident of note during a forgettable opening 45 minutes was the sight of the unfortunate Ryan Taylor being forced from the field in tears, with a man ravaged by injuries in recent times seeing his troubles continue on a first top flight start in two-and-a-half years. He had looked the most likely to force a breakthrough prior to his withdrawal, with a couple of efforts from distance warming the gloves of visiting goalkeeper Rob Green. Moussa Sissoko praises his Newcastle teammates’ work rate following their 1-0 win over QPR. Moussa Sissoko praises his Newcastle teammates’ work rate following their 1-0 win over QPR. The deadlock was to be broken, though, on 78 minutes as Sissoko exchanged passes with Sammy Ameobi and crashed high into the top corner to earn the home side the spoils and leave QPR still searching for their first away point of the season. Welcome Former Newcastle man Joey Barton was afforded a warm welcome on his return to St James' Park, where he spent four seasons before heading for the capital, as he led out the visitors wearing the captain's armband. But there was an even more significant re-appearance for the home side with utility man Taylor starting his first Premier League game since a 1-1 derby draw with Sunderland on March 4, 2012 after two cruciate ligament injuries. Sadly for the 30-year-old his afternoon was to last barely half an hour as he departed after going to ground in some discomfort with all the indications suggesting yet another knee problem. But inside the 34 minutes for which he was on the pitch, it was he who had looked the most likely man to break the deadlock, prompting the home side forward and arriving late into the box to apply the finishing touch to a series of moves. Unfortunately for him, he was unable to take either of the two gilt-edged opportunities which fell his way as Green tipped his curling 17th-minute shot over after Remy Cabella had picked him out on the edge of the box with an intelligent corner and then claimed his side-footed effort after Ayoze Perez and Cabella had set him up following full-back Yun Suk-young's misplaced pass. Blasted Green had earlier enjoyed an escape when he blasted a clearance straight into Jack Colback and saw the ball ricochet just wide as he attempted to deal with Steven Caulker's underhit back-pass, but was more than equal to the task of collecting Cabella's tame 10th-minute shot after the Frenchman had linked well with Sissoko. Massadio Haidara runs away from Nedum Onuhoa Both sides had penalty appeals rightly waved away by referee Chris Foy after Massadio Haidara went down under Sandro's challenge and Leroy Fer under Mike Williamson's. However, Taylor's premature departure changed the game with the visitors sensing their chance and with Barton making an impact, they pressed the Magpies back. Striker Charlie Austin, who had gone wide with a 13th-minute shot, failed to test keeper Tim Krul unduly three minutes before the break, although the Holland international had to be on his toes on the stroke of half-time to keep out defender Richard Dunne's looping header from a Barton corner. Newcastle returned in determined mood with Ameobi and Cabella running at the QPR defence at every opportunity and meeting less than composed resistance, although Barton threw himself into the path of Ameobi's well-struck 48th-minute volley. Scuffed Newcastle’s superb recent form continued with a 1-0 win at home to QPR. Newcastle’s superb recent form continued with a 1-0 win at home to QPR. At the other end, Austin scuffed a left-footed effort on the full straight to Krul, but the traffic remained largely in the other direction, although with Green untested until he had to race from his line and block Perez's shot with his chest after Sissoko had played the youngster in with 57 minutes gone. The keeper was fortunate to escape when he spilled Haidara's driven near-post cross three minutes later and was grateful to see Ameobi head wide as he arrived at pace to meet substitute Yoan Gouffran's 63rd-minute cross. But the visitors were not content to defend and striker Bobby Zamora, who had earlier headed wide, had Krul back-pedalling anxiously with another effort from Karl Henry's 66th-minute cross. Substitute Niko Kranjcar, who had replaced the injured Sandro on the hour, gave QPR fresh impetus but the home side still looked the more likely to score, with Perez testing Green once again with a first-time shot from Gouffran's 74th-minute cross. But the stalemate was finally broken 12 minutes from time when Sissoko turned on Ameobi's pass to fire unerringly past Green and spark joyous celebrations on and off the pitch."},{"date":

Ings notched his first of the afternoon on 12 minutes, tapping in after Begovic spilled Ashley Barnes’ cross-come shot and doubled his tally just 90 seconds later, when he latched onto Michael Kightly's curled centre to silence a stunned Britannia Stadium. Best of the game Man of the match: Danny Ings answered some critics, clinically converting the chances his teammates worked tirelessly to create for him. Goal of the match: Ings' second rewarded Michael Kightly's relentless running down the left for a well-worked winning strike. Save of the match: Tom Heaton turning away a curling Victor Moses effort which was destined for the top corner. Moment of the match: The final whistle for Burnley, and confirmation of back-to-back victories. Talking point: Victor Moses' apparent dive which referee Martin Atkinson correctly waved away. Should the FA take further action against this 'repeat' offender? Jonathan Walters' diving header reduced the deficit in the 32nd for Stoke but Burnley's valiant defensive performance was rewarded with a second successive win that sees them leapfrog Queens Park Rangers and, provisionally, Crystal Palace in the standings. Burnley boss Sean Dyche had stressed after the Hull win the importance of building on that result, and it certainly seemed those words had been absorbed by his players in the opening stages here as the visitors raced into a two-goal lead. On an individual level, those strikes also marked a continuation of momentum for Ings, who had netted twice for England Under-21s at his home ground Turf Moor during the international break. Sean Dyche delighted as Burnley record back-to-back league wins Sean Dyche delighted as Burnley record back-to-back league wins But as Ings grabbed his second and third league goals this term, it was apparent that Stoke - without injured duo Marc Wilson and Erik Pieters in defence – had provided him with a helping hand for each goal.

First, Pieters' replacement Marc Muniesa lost the ball and in the move that followed, Asmir Begovic's parry from Ashley Barnes' cross teed Ings up nicely for a slotted finish. Then, just over a minute and a half later, Burnley's former Stoke man Michael Kightly got the better of Phil Bardsley and had the space to burst forward down the left and cross to an unmarked Ings, who once again made no mistake. Stoke then began to get into the game, with the lively Bojan Krkic having a shot deflect wide. Soon after, the Spaniard provided the delivery which Walters converted with a diving header, goalkeeper Tom Heaton getting a hand to the effort but unable to keep it out. Victor Moses then had penalty claims waved away after going down in the box in a tumble, before curling in a shot that Heaton palmed away. Stoke's quest for an equaliser continued after the break as Moses steered wide. He then departed the field clutching his thigh, with Marko Arnautovic coming on in his place. The Clarets held firm with some brave defending and might have even scored a third goal during the closing stages as Begovic denied substitute Lukas Jutkiewicz.

The Sweden international bent a fine 25-yard effort into the bottom corner on 67 minutes to put Sunderland on course for their second win in a week, but Connor Wickham clattered into Seamus Coleman with 15 minutes remaining and Baines made no mistake from the spot. Best of the Match: Man of the Match: James McCarthy. Capped another impressive display with a point-saving block on the line in second half injury time. Goal of the Match: Free-kick specialist Sebastian Larsson produced another stunner to put Sunderland ahead Miss of the Match: A careless touch cost Romelu Lukaku at the start of the second half. Talking Point: Sunderland look like they're back on track after that 8-0 defeat at Southampton. Everton dominated possession for much of the contest but were indebted to James McCarthy in second-half injury time after the Republic of Ireland international hacked a Wes Brown header off the line. The result keeps Everton 10th, but moves Sunderland up to 14th, three points clear of the drop zone. Sunderland, buoyed by their Monday Night Football victory at Crystal Palace, began brightly and Wickham glanced a Larsson corner wide of the far post in the first minute. Everton responded, with Samuel Eto’o firing a wild shot wide after a nice exchange with Romelu Lukaku, but Wickham was again to the fore on five minutes, connecting with another Larsson corner and looping a header onto the roof of the net. Sunderland’s early impetus faded, though, and despite losing Gareth Barry to injury, Everton began to dominate possession and enjoyed long spells on the edge of their hosts’ box. However, apart from long-range strikes from Lukaku and Barry’s replacement, Darron Gibson, which both flew well over the bar, the visitors struggled to create any genuine openings. At the other end, Sunderland’s rampaging Anthony Reveillere repeatedly burst into the left side of the box and drew a superb tackle from Aiden McGeady on 26 minutes. However, the home fans were incensed moments later when referee Lee Mason waved away appeals for a foul on Jordi Gomez on the edge of the area by Phil Jagielka. Everton charged up the field amid the confusion but Lukaku was only able to nod Ross Barkley’s cross tamely into the arms of Costel Pantilimon. Tim Howard was called upon to produce a fine save on 36 minutes, after Gibson had been caught dithering on the ball in his own box, and did well to turn Gomez's low effort wide with his legs. That was as close as either side came to breaking the deadlock in a disappointing first half, with Barkley’s late surge forward, only to find no options open to him, typical of a conservative approach from both teams in the opening 45. Battle The second half saw a change in attitude from both sides, though, and a breathless, end-to-end battle followed. Lukaku should have scored his fourth in five appearances against Sunderland just three minutes after the re-start but, after capitalising on a Liam Bridcutt error, he over-ran the ball and Pantilimon was able to smother the ball at the Belgian’s feet. Poyet: We competed well Poyet: We competed well Everton then could have had a penalty on 50 minutes when Coleman nicked the ball off Reveillere as he tried to usher it out for a goal-kick, only to tumble in the box. Lee Mason wasn’t swayed but Everton continued to enjoy plenty of possession around Sunderland’s box, with Lukaku rocketing a strike against the woodwork on 56 minutes. Lukaku then fluffed an attempted header from Baines’ cross on 62 minutes, and Everton paid for his wastefulness moments later. Sunderland sub Will Buckley made an immediate impact, bursting forward and drawing a foul from Baines and from the resulting free-kick Larsson curled in the opener and his second of the season. Larsson had the Everton defence at panic stations three minutes later with another free-kick, this time bending a fine cross in from the left touchline, which Gibson was forced to head clear under pressure. Martinez happy with response Martinez happy with response However, Sunderland’s lead lasted just nine minutes. Samuel Eto’o played a fine through ball to the on-rushing Coleman and, just as the right-back was about to pull the trigger, Wickham brought him down from behind. Remarkably, Wickham escaped a card, but Baines blasted the ball down the middle of the goal to pull Everton level – although Pantilimon could have done better to keep it out. Sunderland responded by going in search of a winner and more direct play from Buckley forced Jagielka to clear under pressure. Howard caused controversy with three minutes to go when he opted to fall on the ball as he waited for it to enter his area - but Sunderland’s appeals for handball were rightly ignored. McCarthy, though, was Everton’s hero at the death, blasting away Brown’s powerful header in stoppage time to extend his side’s unbeaten run to four games in the Premier League."},{"date":

win 2-1 at White Hart Lane and increase the pressure on under-fire manager Mauricio Pochettino. First-half goals from Bojan Krkic and Jonathan Walters secured the three points as Spurs finished the game with 10 men after Kyle Naughton’s late dismissal. Nacer Chadli had given the home crowd hope with a fantastic driven volley to reduce the deficit in the 78th minute, but Mark Hughes' side used their man advantage to see the game out against a Spurs side suffering from yet another Europa League hangover. Best of the Match Man of the Match: Jon Walters. His tireless running with quality end product summed up Stoke’s performance – especially in a first half they dominated. Goal of the Match: Bojan’s first Premier League goal was worth the wait as he ran from the halfway line to the edge of the Tottenham box before rifling a shot past Hugo Lloris and into the bottom corner. Save of the Match: Asmir Begovic had little to do against a largely toothless Spurs, but had to be at his best to claw Erik Lamela’s curling free-kick away from the top corner. Moment of the Match: Spurs’ defending was slapdash throughout, but never more so than when the whole back four went missing in action to allow Mame Biram Diouf to square for Walters to score the second. Attempt of the Match: Victor Moses was lively throughout and sent a fizzing shot just wide from the corner of the penalty area after leaving Kyle Naughton trailing in his wake. Talking Point: With the boos from the home fans starting in the first half of a desperately poor Spurs performance, questions will inevitably be asked about both the manager and the squad. The game’s first opportunity came for Harry Kane with just two minutes on the clock - with Pochettino rewarding the striker's recent goalscoring exploits with a place in the starting line-up instead of Emmanuel Adebayor. Christian Eriksen found Chadli in space and, after dancing straight through the heart of the Stoke defence, the Belgian whipped a cross onto the head of Kane, only for the in-form striker to head directly into the arms of Asmir Begovic in the Stoke goal. Begovic's clearance upfield caused havoc in the Spurs defence, releasing Mame Biram Diouf and sending the Senegalese striker on a collision course with the on-rushing home keeper, Hugo Lloris. After treating their injured striker Stoke regrouped and collected the ball just inside their half. After some intricate one-touch play, Bojan found space and, after running unopposed to the edge of the Tottenham area, he unleashed a low shot past the unsighted Lloris to give the visitors the lead. Phil Bardsley’s return to first-team action after suspension lasted just nine minutes, with the injured full-back replaced by Geoff Cameron. But the Potters were not fazed by the early enforced change, and launched a series of counters through Victor Moses and Walters in search of a second goal. Stoke were dealt another blow as Mark Wilson hobbled off on 25 minutes but, once again, Marc Muniesa's entrance seemed effortless to the visitors who doubled their advantage within 10 minutes of the change. Danny Rose’s hacked clearance appeared to relieve pressure but the ball was headed back into the path of Diouf by Ryan Shawcross and, after gathering, the striker found the unmarked Walters in the penalty area and he steered past Lloris. Pochettino: We made mistakes Pochettino: We made mistakes The half-time whistle was greeted by a chorus of boos from the Tottenham faithful, and manager Pochettino rang the changes for the start of the second period, bringing Erik Lamela and Moussa Dembele on for the ineffective duo of Townsend and Eriksen. With the fears of letting a two-goal lead slip fresh in their minds following last week’s 2-2 draw with West Ham, Stoke pushed for a third goal but Moses’ curled effort was comfortably saved by Lloris. It was Tottenham, however, who had a clearer opportunity to score as goalscorer Walters was caught in the unfamiliar right-back position and came under pressure from Rose and Kane. The Irishman’s scuffed clearance ricocheted around the area but Kane was unable to get a shot away and Stoke cleared their lines. Kane was presented with an even better opportunity to reduce the arrears just moments later. Lamela’s whipped delivery from a free-kick on the left was met by the England Under-21 international but his glancing header missed the target, and a route back into the game for the host, with Begovic stranded. Hughes: We deserved win Hughes: We deserved win Frustration set in throughout the Tottenham ranks, and this was illustrated when Rose lashed out at Walters after the pair tussled for possession. Younes Kaboul’s attempt to resolve the dispute fell on deaf ears and the Spurs captain sought his own retribution in the next phase of play - lunging high on the Stoke striker and being booked for his troubles by referee Mike Jones. After seeing Moses and Steven N’Zonzi fail to capitalise on yet more anxious home defending, Spurs mounted a final challenge to get back into the game, with Begovic’s finger-tip save denying Lamela’s exquisite free kick. But Tottenham had the ball in the net two minutes later, and in emphatic style, as Chadli volleyed powerfully past Begovic from a tight angle. However, hopes of a grandstand finish for the home side were dashed five minutes before time as Naughton chopped down Moses as the forward sprinted past the right-back and through on goal and referee Jones brandished a straight red. The result sees Stoke leapfrog Tottenham, who fell to their fourth home defeat in the league this season, into ninth place in the Premier League. Mauricio Pochettino's men, meanwhile, find themselves languishing in 12th, a point behind Sunday's opponents."},{"date": "09/11/2015", "arena": "The Hawthorns", "attendance": 26476, "home_team":

their recent resurgence with a 2-0 win over West Brom at the Hawthorns to move up to eighth spot in the table. Ayoze Perez's goal on the stroke of half-time set Newcastle on their way - his third Premier League goal in the last three games. Best of the Match Man of the match: Daryl Janmaat created both goals and defended well at the back Goal of the match: Ayoze Perez showed great skill to backheel the cross from Janmaat into the bottom corner. Save of the match: Ben Foster showed great reactions late on to tip Perez's close-range volley over the crossbar. Miss of the match: Andre Wisdom had a great chance to score, but he blazed his left-footed shot horribly over the crossbar Moment of the match: The first goal from Perez on the stroke of half-time was the turning point in the game in what had been an even contest up until the goal. Talking point: Can Newcastle build on their fine form and challenge for a top six finish? Are West Brom facing a battle to stay up this season? Captain Fabricio Coloccini doubled the lead just past the hour mark to give Alan Pardew's side their fifth successive win in all competitions - including their League Cup triumph over Manchester City. The three-point haul moves Newcastle level with Manchester United, while West Brom remain in 13th spot heading into the international break. After a quiet start Newcastle went close to scoring on ten minutes when Andre Wisdom's poor clearance fell to Sammy Ameobi on the edge of the box and he curled in a shot which clipped the top of the crossbar with Ben Foster well beaten in the West Brom goal. West Brom created their first chance of the game on 16 minutes when Saido Berahino linked up with strike partner Victor Anichebe on the edge of the box and fired in a shot which Tim Krul just about palmed over the crossbar. The home side fashioned another opening four minutes later when Graham Dorrans got free down the right and picked out Chris Brunt inside the box, but the midfielder could not his the target with a header. Newcastle broke the deadlock right on the stroke of half-time with a goal of real quality from in-form striker Perez to light up the first half. Pardew proud of performance Pardew proud of performance Remy Cabella picked out Daryl Janmaat's run down the right and he fired over a low cross which Perez brilliantly backheeled into the corner from 12 yards out. West Brom tried to raise the tempo in the second half and Krul had a lucky escape when he misjudged Brunt's ball towards Anichebe, missing it altogether, and he was relieved to see Paul Dummett on hand to clear the danger. Youssouf Mulumbu had a sight of goal for West Brom on the hour mark when he picked up a loose pass from Sissoko, but he dragged his shot wide. Krul: We showed quality and spirit Krul: We showed quality and spirit Two minutes later and Newcastle grabbed a second goal with Janmaat again the provider as he fired over a superb cross for Coloccini to head down into the ground past Foster with his first goal in over three years. West Brom wasted a great chance to reduce the arrears on on 79 minutes when the ball fell to Wisdom inside the box, but the defender got his shot all wrong as he blazed it horribly wide of the target. Newcastle went close to a third goal four minutes from time when Perez's volley was brilliantly tipped over the crossbar by Foster, but it did not matter as the visitors ran out comfortable

"Premier League: Super substitute Gomis strikes as Swansea come from behind to beat Arsenal Bafetimbi Gomis heads Swansea's winner Swansea came from behind to beat Arsenal 2-1 at the Liberty Stadium and climb above the Gunners in the Premier League table. Bafetimbi Gomis, on as a substitute for Wilfried Bony, made an immediate impact to power in Jefferson Montero's cross for his first Premier League goal to earn the home side the points. Best of the match Man of the match – Jefferson Montero: A threat all afternoon as he made it an uncomfortable day for Calum Chambers and set up the winner for Bafetimbi Gomis Goal of the match: Gylfi Sigurdsson’s long range free-kick was superbly struck and gave Wojciech Szczesny no chance Save of the match: Lukasz Fabianski saved well against his old club to deny Danny Welbeck at the near post, Talking point: How many times can Arsenal’s defence continue to throw leads away if they are to remain trophy contenders? The Swans had trailed to Alexis Sanchez's 63rd minute effort but got back on terms thanks to a fabulous Gylfi Sigurdsson free-kick before Gomis got the winner just 90 seconds after coming on. It was another collapse from Arsene Wenger's men, coming just five days after their Champions League setback against Anderlecht when they led 3-0 only to be pulled back to 3-3 at the Emirates Stadium. Wenger made only one change after the Anderlecht draw and that was enforced as Mikel Arteta dropped out with a hamstring injury and Mathieu Flamini adopted the holding role in midfield. Swansea were forced to hand first league starts of the season to central defender Kyle Bartley and wideman Marvin Emnes with Federico Fernandez and Wayne Routledge injured, while on-loan Tottenham midfielder Tom Carroll came in for the suspended Jonjo Shelvey. But there was no sign of unfamiliarity in Swansea's play as they started well and Sigurdsson sent over a dangerous free-kick which was headed clear at the far post by Calum Chambers. Sanchez almost got a shot away under pressure but the Chilean, with five goals in his last three appearances, was crowded out and was kept on a tight leash until the closing moments of the first half. Swansea had the greater attacking edge and they had strong claims for a penalty when Chambers, who was having a difficult afternoon up against the fleet-footed Montero, bundled into the back of Bony as Emnes' cross came over. It was a clumsy challenge by the young right-back but referee Phil Dowd was unmoved and waved play on, Montero immediately forcing Wojciech Szczesny to tip his shot around the post. Williams and Sigurdsson delighted Williams and Sigurdsson delighted The Montero/Neil Taylor axis was working well down Swansea's left and the pair created another opportunity, with the latter crossing into the Arsenal penalty area where Nacho Monreal was on hand to block Angel Rangel's drive. Sigurdsson also saw his shot blocked after strong play from Bony but Swansea's best chance of the half arrived after 36 minutes when Chambers stumbled and the hosts launched a swift counter-attack. Montero found Bony, who put Emnes into space on the left but the Dutchman's firm effort was straight at Szczesny. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain had posed problems down Swansea's left with both Taylor and Ki Sung-yueng picking up bookings for fouls on him, but Arsenal had been toothless in attack until the final five minutes of the half. Wenger: We lost the battle Wenger: We lost the battle First Lukasz Fabianski saved well against his old club to deny Danny Welbeck at the near post, and then Aaron Ramsey struck a dropping ball superbly on the volley to go tantalisingly close. And deep into first-half stoppage time the unmarked Per Mertesacker met Santi Cazorla's corner from 10 yards but sent his header wide of Fabianski's far post. Arsenal started the second half as they finished the first with their midfield on top, Sanchez increasingly involved and Oxlade-Chamberlain a constant threat. Strong running from Oxlade-Chamberlain set up Welbeck down the right but he chose to try and find a team-mate rather than shoot from a narrow angle and the chance was lost. Monk: Belief the key Monk: Belief the key Fabianski did well to hold on to Cazorla's deflected shot as the heavens opened but Arsenal's pressure finally told after 63 minutes. Oxlade-Chamberlain was the predictable provider as he surged through the middle, Cazorla helped it on to Welbeck down the left and he teed it up for Sanchez in front of goal. Bony spurned an equaliser when he scuffed Montero's cross but Swansea were level 15 minutes from time when Kieran Gibbs illegally ended the run of pacy substitute Modou Barrow. Sigurdsson stepped up to take the 25-yard free-kick and he sent it over the wall and away from the reach of Szczesny for his first league goal since the opening day win at Manchester United. Gomis was sent on and the Frenchman rose above Monreal from Montero's cross to head past Szczesny and take Swansea above Arsenal into the top five."},{"date": "08/11/2015", "arena": "Anfield", "attendance": 44698, "home_team": {"name": "Liverpool", "lineup": [{"name": "Simon Mignolet", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Glen Johnson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Skrtel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dejan Lovren", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alberto Moreno", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordan Henderson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Gerrard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Emre Can", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [70]}, {"name": "Philippe Coutinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [70]}, {"name": "Mario Balotelli", "yellows": [65], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [79]}, {"name": "Raheem Sterling", "yellows": [43], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Brad Jones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kolo Touré", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rickie Lambert", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [79], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Lallana", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lucas Leiva", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Allen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [70], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fabio Borini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [70], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Chelsea", "lineup": [{"name": "Thibaut Courtois", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Branislav Ivanovic", "yellows": [48], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gary Cahill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Terry", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "César Azpilicueta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nemanja Matic", "yellows": [69], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cesc Fàbregas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ramires", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [54]}, {"name": "Oscar", "yellows": [83], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eden Hazard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Diego Costa", "yellows": [87], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}], "subs": [{"name": "Petr Cech", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Filipe Luis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kurt Zouma", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Didier Drogba", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Mikel Obi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Loïc Remy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willian", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [54], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Diego Costa scored the winner as Chelsea maintained their grip of the Premier League title race with a 2-1 victory at Liverpool. Dropped by Spain on Friday to allow him to recover from a string of nagging injuries, Costa started at Anfield and drove home his 10th league goal of the season in the 67th minute after Cesar Azpilicueta's cross was parried out. Chelsea had to come from behind to secure a ninth victory in 11 games after German midfielder Emre Can scored for Liverpool from a deflected shot in the ninth minute. Best of the Match Goal of the Match: Poacher supreme Diego Costa in the right spot again as he fired Chelsea to another three points. Man of the Match: Eden Hazard was a threat throughout and brought a number of last-ditch blocks out of the Liverpool defence. Save of the Match: Thibaut Courtois got down well to parry a fierce attempt from Raheem Sterling. Moment of the Match: Chelsea dodged a bullet as Gary Cahill got away with a pretty clear handball after a late Steven Gerrard shot. Attempt of the Match: Jordan Henderson could not have met his second-half volley any sweeter only to see it clout Nemanja Matic and bounce clear of danger. Talking point: Brendan Rodgers is clearly trying to kick-start Liverpool but his patience with Mario Balotelli’s current contribution up front must be wearing thin. Gary Cahill equalised with a scrappy goal from a corner in the 14th. Liverpool have now lost three successive games in all competitions and trail Chelsea by a huge 15 points. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers restored a host of the first-team players controversially rested for the midweek loss to Real Madrid in the Champions League and saw his team go ahead early on. Can had a shot deflected over by John Terry in the first minute, but Chelsea did not heed the warning and when he took aim from similar range moments later, the ball cannoned off Cahill and into the net. But within five minutes Chelsea were level, after a goal that required the aid of goal-line technology. Simon Mignolet parried from Terry at a corner and although the Liverpool goalkeeper got his body fully behind Cahill's follow-up, Hawk-Eye replays showed that the Belgian had carried the ball over the line. While Chelsea finished the first half strongly, they were indebted to goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois for getting down sharply to thwart Philippe Coutinho and Raheem Sterling either side of half-time. Having been embroiled in a physical tussle with Martin Skrtel for much of the game, Costa provided a reminder of his predatory instincts to settle the game in the 67th minute. After eluding Coutinho on the Chelsea left, Azpilicueta saw his cross pushed out by Mignolet, but Costa was in the right place to rattle a half-volley into the net from close range. There was late controversy when Liverpool had a late penalty appeal turned down after a shot from Gerrard hit Cahill on the arm. Ruud Gullit's verdict Jose Mourinho was looking for a replacement for Didier Drogba and has found it in Diego Costa. His foundation is good and that is of course the defence. It looks so strong. Therefore the other players in midfield and the strikers have the ability to do whatever they like. On the moment they need to defend a victory they can – and easily. That is good.

Burnley boss Sean Dyche brought Barnes into the side in the one change to his starting line-up from last Saturday's 3-0 defeat at Arsenal and the striker rewarded his manager’s faith, heading home the winner on 50 minutes from Keiran Trippier’s cross. Best of the match Man of the match: Ashley Barnes. Goals win games and Barnes delivered the vital breakthrough. Shot of the match: Danny Ings shot in the first period forced Hull keeper Steve Harper into a good save Save of the match: As above – Harper diving to his left to deny Ings. Moment of the match: Robbie Brady had to clear off the line soon after Harper’s save following Paul McShane’s poor clearance. Talking points: Burnley’s first win of the top-flight campaign gives them real hope heading into the international break. Hull’s poor display will worry Steve Bruce. Hull were poor and almost went behind in the first period when Danny Ings drew a great save from Steve Harper. Paul McShane then got his clearance wrong and Robbie Brady had to clear off the line. Burnley were then playing against 10 men for the final 20 minutes - Hull captain Curtis Davies having been forced off with an injury when his side had already made three substitutions – but Dyche's team could not add to their tally. That will not bother Burnley fans, who had not celebrated a Premier League win for their team since May 2010. And while Dyche's side remain bottom of the table they are now only two points from safety, having taken their total to seven. Hull, who have not scored in three straight games, stay two points clear of the drop zone in 14th place. The hosts almost had a goal in the opening minute when the ball was lofted forward and Ings got the better of his marker James Chester before hooking just wide of the far post as Harper came out to meet him. Soon after, Abel Hernandez tried to carve out room for a shot at the other end and sent a tame effort off-target. Hull were on the attack again four minutes later when Michael Duff gave the ball away and Sone Aluko burst forward, but his progress was halted in the box by a fine challenge from Clarets skipper Jason Shackell. Burnley's ex-Hull man George Boyd then saw a scuffed shot easily collected by Harper, before the hosts went the closest yet to breaking the deadlock. From a corner, the ball came to Ings and his shot brought a great save out of Harper. The rebound was nearly sliced into his own net by McShane, but Brady was on hand to hack the ball off the line. Ings: Season starts now Ings: Season starts now Burnley fans subsequently appealed for a penalty when Brady tackled Scott Arfield in the box, but referee Mark Clattenburg gave a free-kick on the edge of the area instead for a foul by McShane on Barnes, and the set-piece amounted to nothing. Dyche's team seemed to be gifted a corner five minutes later as Harper inadvertently carried the ball over the touchline as he made a catch, but again, they could not make the opening count for anything. Ambitious Ings tried to embarrass Harper further towards the end of the first half, attempting to catch the goalkeeper off his line with a shot from inside the Burnley half, but his ambitious effort lacked accuracy, and McShane then sent a header over just before the whistle for the break. Burnley off the mark Burnley off the mark The Clarets continued to probe at the start of the second half and got their reward five minutes in when Barnes rose to crash home Trippier's cross. It was Barnes' first goal of the season, and the first time his side had even led a game since their campaign-opening 3-1 loss here to Chelsea. Hull boss Steve Bruce responded by making three substitutions, bringing on Stephen Quinn, Gaston Ramirez and Hatem Ben Arfa for Aluko, Tom Huddlestone and Chester, before Boyd controlled the ball from a Harper punch and lashed it into the stand. Bruce: Performance not acceptable Bruce: Performance not acceptable Davies was similarly well off-target as he miscued an acrobatic effort, landing awkwardly on his back, and his afternoon's work then came to an early end as he had to depart the field injured, leaving Hull a player short. Hernandez fired a warning with a turn and shot wide from the edge of the area, but a poor Hull could not muster much else. Neither could Burnley, despite the man advantage, but when the final whistle was blown by Clattenburg - who made a late flurry of bookings - they had done enough to earn the win which gives them real hope heading into the international break. Matt Le Tissier’s verdict Le Tissier: Burnley put a shift in Le Tissier: Burnley put a shift in It wasn’t a classic by any stretch of the imagination, but I was really impressed with the work-rate of the Burnley players. It’s the first time I’ve watched Burnley on Soccer Saturday this season and those boys put in a shift and got their rewards for it with the goal just after half-time. They looked the more likely side and had the best couple of chances in the first half. Hull very rarely threatened. I watched Hull away at Arsenal when they did look dangerous on the counter, but today they didn’t threaten at all. They had one shot on target in the whole game, which was comfortable for the Burnley keeper and there was very little else. They threw on Ben Arfa and Ramirez to try and give them a little bit of creativity and neither of them really sparked anything or created too much. It wasn’t what I was used to seeing from Hull. They’ve been more dangerous than that in recent weeks."},{"date": "08/11/2015", "arena": "Old Trafford", "attendance": 75325, "home_team": {"name": "Manchester United", "lineup": [{"name": "David De Gea", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Antonio Valencia", "yellows": [83], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paddy McNair", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Daley Blind", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Luke Shaw", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Carrick", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adnan Januzaj", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [63]}, {"name": "Marouane Fellaini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wayne Rooney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ángel di María", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [71]}, {"name": "Robin van Persie", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Juan Mata", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [63], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Anders Lindegaard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ander Herrera", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Darren Fletcher", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marnick Vermijl", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tyler Blackett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Wilson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [71], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Crystal Palace", "lineup": [{"name": "Julian Speroni", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adrian Mariappa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Scott Dann", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Damien Delaney", "yellows": [38], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joel Ward", "yellows": [35], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jason Puncheon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James McArthur", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Ledley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yannick Bolasie", "yellows": [64], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [81]}, {"name": "Marouane Chamakh", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [81]}, {"name": "Fraizer Campbell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}], "subs": [{"name": "Paddy McCarthy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin Doyle", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wayne Hennessey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dwight Gayle", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [81], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Zeki Fryers", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Barry Bannan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [81], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Kelly", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Juan Mata climbed off the bench to lift Manchester United into sixth spot in the Premier League with a 1-0 home win over Crystal Palace on Saturday. Just four minutes after coming on for Adnan Januzaj, the United midfielder curled a 67th-minute deflected shot past Julian Speroni to hand Louis van Gaal's men the victory. The result was a welcome one for United fans and their manager, who had not won any of his previous three matches. Best of the Match Goal of the Match: Juan Mata's strike from the edge of the box was deflected, but was crucial for United. Save of the Match: Julian Speroni was smartly down to his near post to deny Luke Shaw’s low shot after the defender had burst into the box. Moment of the Match: Fraizer Campbell’s gilt-edged first-half miss when he was one-on-one with Julian Speroni after Daley Blind and Paddy McNair had left the ball for each other. Man of the Match: Juan Mata showed his class when he came on to win the points for the hosts. But in truth, he will still feel a bit of the lousiness he spoke about at his pre-match press conference on Friday. Newcastle, West Ham and Sunderland had all scored three goals against Palace before this weekend, yet United did not look like cracking open the Eagles' defence for large parts of this match. Luke Shaw tested Julian Speroni with a low shot and Marouane Fellaini had a header cleared off the line, but United offered little else going forward. Palace will feel they could have taken a much-needed point from Old Trafford. Fraizer Campbell wasted a great chance to score against his old employers in the first half. But Van Gaal will still be happy that his makeshift team returned to winning ways with a result that moves them up to fifth in the Barclays Premier League. Januzaj let fly with a powerful shot which dipped just over the bar, but otherwise United found Palace's defence hard to crack in the first half. The hosts enjoyed plenty of possession, but Neil Warnock's defence dropped deep and United barely entered the away box. Robin van Persie struck a low goal-bound shot, but Damien Delaney hooked the ball clear just before Fellaini could tap in. Shaw embarked on a 40-yard run and drove the ball through Scott Dann's legs, but Speroni tipped wide. It was to be United's last decent chance of the first half. At the other end, United's defence had a predictably chaotic look to it. Juan Mata hails 'massive' win Juan Mata hails 'massive' win With four centre-backs out through injury or suspension, Daley Blind and Paddy McNair started and the early signs were not too good. Campbell made just two appearances during his five-year spell at Old Trafford, but he was causing problems for United's centre-back pairing. Yannick Bolasie swung over a ball on the break, but Campbell just missed out and Shaw deflected wide. It was a difficult chance for the 27-year-old, his next one was much easier. Joel Ward lumped a simple ball long. Blind and McNair both tried and failed to clear, which meant Campbell was through on goal but the striker panicked and lobbed the opportunity over David de Gea's bar. A concerned-looking Van Gaal conversed with his assistant Ryan Giggs as he walked off at the break. How he must have wished he had a man of the Welshman's ability to bring on and change the game at the break. Van Gaal: We deserved win Van Gaal: We deserved win There was a slight improvement from United at the start of the second half. Wayne Rooney curled a low shot just wide after a surging run from McNair. And Fellaini then went extremely close. The Belgian rose to meet Angel di Maria's corner, but his header was cleared off the line by James McArthur. Palace threatened again on the break through Mariappa, who crossed to the back post, but Bolasie made a hash of his effort and United breathed again. Result disappoints Warnock Result disappoints Warnock Van Gaal looked to Mata to make the difference and he did not disappoint as he put United ahead shortly after his introduction. Mata exchanged passes with Di Maria and fired a curling shot past Speroni. The Palace goalkeeper will feel he should have saved the shot even though it took a deflection off the head of Delaney. Van Gaal was alone in not celebrating on the United bench. He clearly felt the breakthrough should have come earlier. Palace pushed for an equaliser and Campbell entered the box and struck a low drive towards goal, but Michael Carrick put in a crucial block. Mata struck a post as United countered and Van Persie wasted the follow-up, blazing high and wide, but one goal proved enough. Paul Merson’s verdict Merson not impressed with Man Utd Merson not impressed with Man Utd When Man United had all the play when I used to play against them or watch them, they had loads of chances, but they never really looked like scoring. Fellaini had a header cleared of the line and then they took Januzaj off and put Mata on and his goal took a little bit of a deflection – but for me the goalkeeper should save it still. Speroni got good hands on it and pushed it straight into the net. Mata hit the post again, but that was it really. Get used to it Man United fans because it ain’t going to be pretty. At 1-0 they were hanging on. The fans were pushing them on to get another one and you could hear the groans because they were comfortable just playing for a 1-0. That’s a change. For me at the moment they are stuttering and nicking results. That ain’t great. I would be concerned for Palace because this league is ruthless and when you get on a run, it’s hard to get off that run. They missed Jedinak today. Not so much Zaha, but Jedinak definitely because he closes down and makes the tackles in midfield.

The visitors looked on course for a hard-earned point at a rain-hit St Mary’s but Ireland international Long hit a quick-fire double in the final 15 minutes to condemn Nigel Pearson’s side to a fourth-straight defeat, which leaves Leicester in the relegation zone. Best of the Match Man of the Match: Shane Long. The Ireland international stepped off the bench and changed the game. Southampton had failed to test Kasper Schmeichel before his arrival – but his finishing was clinical. Moment of the match: Chris Wood could have set up a big finale but fluffed his lines. Clean through on goal, with Fraser Forster on the deck, he could only chip wide. Stat of the match: Southampton have won six and lost none of their last eight Premier League matches at St Mary’s. Talking point: As Southampton hold on to second in the Premier League for another week – how high can Ronald Koeman’s side finish this season? Will they be playing Champions League football next season? Southampton barely tested Kasper Schmeichel in the opening 75 minutes, despite dominating possession, but Long's introduction proved decisive, as he curled in a Graziano Pelle lay-off with 15 minutes to go, before breaking through and slotting home a crucial second (85) - his first league goals for the club. Sub Chris Wood could have set up a grandstand finish but wasted a golden opportunity on 87 minutes, chipping wide when clean through on goal, but Southampton fully deserved maximum points after a dominant performance, which moves Ronald Koeman's side to within four points of table-topping Chelsea. The hosts went into the contest full of confidence after recording the best defensive record and joint-top goal difference in the top flight from their first 10 games and immediately had Leicester on the back foot. Dusan Tadic and then Morgan Schneiderlin both failed to find the head of Pelle with crosses into the box inside the first seven minutes, before the impressive Ryan Bertrand, afforded plenty of space on the left flank, whipped in a fine ball which Pelle really should have converted - although an offside flag spared the Italian's blushes. Nathaniel Clyne then rifled a shot into the arms of Kasper Schmeichel from the edge of the box after Leicester half-cleared a corner - but that would be Southampton's only effort on target in the first period. The best opportunity of the opening 45 fell to the hard-working Sadio Mane, though, and the Senegal forward should have worked Schmeichel from a tight angle, rather than blast over on 35 minutes. Isolated At the other end of the field the returning Leonardo Ulloa was left isolated and only Jamie Vardy's tenacity caused Jose Fonte any bother - the Englishman forcing Southampton's captain to clear for a corner under pressure. Patience key for Koeman Patience key for Koeman Steven Davis limped off just before the break - which will be a blow to Northern Ireland ahead of their European Qualifier with Romania - but his replacement Jack Cork was instantly up to speed with play, and made Esteban Cambiasso hack the ball behind to prevent Clyne from latching on to the substitute's lay-off. Leicester started the second period brightly, forcing an early corner, which was cleared by Pelle, but the Italian was soon causing the visitor's backline problems himself and blasted a left-foot volley over the bar on 49 minutes after good work from Mane. Southampton then had the ball in the net on 52 minutes, but Mane, who had slotted home a Bertrand centre, saw his effort rightly ruled out for offside. With Wes Morgan proving to be a rock at the heart of the Leicester defence, clearing numerous crosses into the box, it seemed Leicester could be set to earn their first point in over a month - however, Long's arrival changed the game. Long the hero for Saints Long the hero for Saints Cork floated a cross into Pelle on 75 minutes and the Italian used his strength to hold off his marker and tee-up Long - and the forward curled a beautiful left-foot shot into the far corner from the edge of the box. Leicester looked deflated and were hit again ten minutes later when Victor Wanyama lofted a ball through the middle, sending Long clean through on goal, and the Irishman made no mistake to double Southampton's advantage. Leicester could have forced a nervous final three minutes for their hosts had Wood found the target from 12 yards after breaking through Southampton's backline - but the New Zealand international tamely clipped the ball wide with Fraser Forster exposed. Long could have bagged a hat-trick with the last kick of the game but by then he had already won the match for Southampton, who continued their excellent run of results. Phil Thompson’s verdict Saints defence the key Saints defence the key Good teams play below par and still find enough to win the game. Kasper Schmeichel was not really worried in this game and he and Nigel Pearson would probably be feeling very happy with themselves going on 75 minutes – and then Shane Long comes on as sub and shows some great centre-forward play. This team is the Liverpool of last year. They play below par and they’ve still got enough to go and do it. Defensively it is seven cleans sheets this season. That gives them the rock; a lot of teams defend poorly and this Southampton team defends better than most. The two centre-backs are excellent and the two full-backs can run like the wind. They get forward well and get back, tuck in and do everything right. That gives them a good base and then the three in the middle – Wanyama, Schneiderlin and Davis – all know each other’s place. They keep rotating to keep the ball moving. Tadic did not have his best game today, so his mum and dad will be disappointed after they flew over here to watch!"},{"date": "08/11/2015", "arena": "Upton Park", "attendance": 34857, "home_team": {"name": "West Ham United", "lineup": [{"name": "Adrián", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Carl Jenkinson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Collins", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Winston Reid", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Cresswell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex Song", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mark Noble", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Cheikhou Kouyaté", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [66]}, {"name": "Stewart Downing", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Diafra Sakho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Enner Valencia", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [75]}], "subs": [{"name": "Kevin Nolan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [66], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Tomkins", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andy Carroll", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joey O'Brien", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Morgan Amalfitano", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jussi Jaaskelainen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Carlton Cole", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [75], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Aston Villa", "lineup": [{"name": "Brad Guzan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matthew Lowton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ron Vlaar", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathan Baker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [88]}, {"name": "Aly Cissokho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Cleverley", "yellows": [69], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Westwood", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Carlos Sánchez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charles N'Zogbia", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Gabriel Agbonlahor", "yellows": [89], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andreas Weimann", "yellows": [69], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Ciaran Clark", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leandro Bacuna", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Cole", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Philippe Senderos", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [88], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kieran  Richardson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Darren Bent", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shay Given", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Aston Villa stopped the rot after six consecutive defeats with a hard-earned goalless draw against West Ham at Upton Park. Goalkeeper Brad Guzan was the Villa hero after a string of fine saves including an sensational reaction stop to deny substitute Andy Carroll in the fourth minute of stoppage time. Stewart Downing also came close for the Hammers, who still manged to inch above Arsenal into fourth place, despite the draw. Best of the Match: Man of the match: Brad Guzan – The Villa goalkeeper pulled off a number of outstanding saves to deny West Ham. Save of the match: Late substitute Andy Carroll was denied the winner from a flying one-handed save by Guzan. Moment of the match: Carl Jenkinson's point-blank header fell straight into the grateful hands of the busy Brad Guzan between the Villa sticks. Performer of the match: Stewart Downing - The winger celebrated his England call-up with another virtuoso display in West Ham colours. Stat of the match: The Hammers have won just five of the last 28 Premier League meetings with the Villans (W5 D14 L9). Talking point: Now that Villa have stopped the rot after six consecutive league defeats can they push on? Will West Ham be happy with a point? Gabby Agbonlahor and Andy Weimann posed a threat for Paul Lambert's side as they finally ended their losing streak since winning at Liverpool in mid-September to pick up a valuable share of the spoils. Villa had set themselves up to be hard to break down, while also offering a forward threat through Weimann and Charles N'Zogbia, supported by Agbonlahor, who came in for Christian Benteke, the Belgian starting a three-match ban after his red card against Spurs. The former England man darted into the West Ham box past James Collins, but then lifted his shot over the crossbar. At the other end, the Irons defender then sent a powerful header goalwards from a corner, which was straight at a grateful Guzan. West Ham maintained the pressure as the quarter-hour mark approached, but then almost hit the self-destruct button on 18 minutes as Winston Reid overhit a backpass, which goalkeeper Adrian mis-controlled and the ball almost rolled inside the far post. It was then the turn of Guzan to enjoy a slice of fortune as he came out to punch a highball into the box from Aaron Cresswell, but clattered into Aly Cissokho as he challenged with Diafra Sakho, the ball dropping wide. The American, though, showed good hands moments later as he beat away a fierce, angled drive from Stewart Downing, the one-time Villa midfielder just recalled to the England squad. Carroll delighted to be back Carroll delighted to be back Villa remained dangerous on the break, and went close on 38 minutes. N'Zogbia ghosted into the left side of the West Ham penalty area, and rolled the ball back to Andreas Weimann, who moved inside before drilling a 15-yard strike straight at Adrian. In first-half stoppage time, West Ham worked the ball well from the right along the Villa penalty area out to Downing on the left - but the midfielder could only skew his shot into the side netting. Weimann threatened for Villa just after the restart, lifting a rising shot over following more positive approach play from Agbonlahor. Draw disappoints Allardyce Draw disappoints Allardyce Allardyce sent on captain Kevin Nolan after 65 minutes, replacing Cheikhou Kouyate. Tempers were rising, with Villa midfielder Tom Cleverley booked for clattering into Diafra Sakho, fit again following a shoulder injury, before Weimann was shown a yellow card for dissent. Adrian was alert to kick the ball away after Nolan's clearance ricocheted back into the six-yard box. West Ham broke away down the right on 78 minutes through substitute Carlton Cole, who chipped the ball across to Sakho waiting on the penalty spot, but the usually clinical Senegal forward dropped a header wide. Big point for Lambert Big point for Lambert There was a stoppage when Villa defender Nathan Baker went down in his own penalty area after clattering into Cole, with referee Jon Moss awarding a free-kick against the West Ham striker - much to the frustrations of home players and fans alike. The injury, though, was serious enough for the Villa man to be carried off on a stretcher, replaced by Philippe Senderos. West Ham looked for a winner, as full-back Carl Jenkinson headed straight at the keeper, with Guzan then denying Carroll - back from an ankle injury - as he palmed away a point-blank header from the England forward to earn Villa a well-deserved point. Charlie Nicholas’ verdict In the initial 20 minutes, Villa looked really nervous at the back and managed to get away with a lot of situations but they gradually crept into the game. The big problem for Villa is expressing themselves. They have got to have better quality when they get the ball because it’s hard enough to get it. They had no Christian Benteke and Gabriel Agbonlahor never really threatened much, but he should have scored in the first half. In the second half they had great spells in the game. West Ham made plenty of opportunities. Sakho didn’t get many opportunities until the final 20 minutes and Guzan had an absolutely outstanding day. It was a thoroughly enjoyable 0-0, it really was. It was a very exciting game with plenty of chances created and Aston Villa should take a lot of credit. It was an enjoyable point for Paul Lambert, but Sam Allardyce will be frustrated."},{"date": "08/11/2015", "arena": "Kiyan Prince Foundation Stadium", "attendance": 18005, "home_team": {"name": "Queens Park Rangers", "lineup": [{"name": "Robert Green", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mauricio Isla", "yellows": [37], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Richard Dunne", "yellows": [40], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Caulker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Suk-Young Yun", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eduardo Vargas", "yellows": [45], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Karl Henry", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sandro", "yellows": [19], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Leroy Fer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bobby Zamora", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charlie Austin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Clint Hill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matt Phillips", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joey Barton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex McCarthy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nedum Onuoha", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Niko Kranjcar", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Junior Hoilett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Manchester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Joe Hart", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bacary Sagna", "yellows": [55], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martín Demichelis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [76], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eliaquim Mangala", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gael Clichy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fernandinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [64]}, {"name": "Fernando", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jesus Navas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yaya Touré", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Samir Nasri", "yellows": [45], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [74]}, {"name": "Sergio Agüero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Edin Dzeko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [64], "sub_off": [68]}, {"name": "Pablo Zabaleta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Milner", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [74], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willy Caballero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Frank Lampard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [68], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stevan Jovetic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dedryck Boyata", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Queens Park Rangers and Manchester City fought out a 2-2 draw at Loftus Road in a game full of talking points. Charlie Austin gave Rangers a first half lead with a neat finish in front of watching England manager Roy Hodgson before Sergio Aguero levelled matters on 32 minutes. Best of the match Man of the match: Sergio Aguero. Where would Manchester City be without the Argentine striker? Aguero had to be at his sharpest to save a point for the champions with two superbly taken goals Save of the match: Joe Hart enjoyed a personal battle with Charlie Austin and had to show England form to deny the QPR striker with a superb stop down to his right. Goal of the match: Aguero’s first was wonderfully taken as he controlled Mangala’s long ball before turning inside Steven Caulker and firing beyond Rob Green who protested furiously that the Argentine used his hand in the build-up. Talking point: Joe Hart had a lucky escape on eight minutes he inadvertently took two touches from a free kick which went straight to Austin who fired home only for the goal to be ruled out. A Martin Demichelis own goal looked like it had given Rangers a crucial win in their battle to escape the drop zone before Aguero netted a second equaliser with eight minutes remaining as City dropped further behind leaders Chelsea in the Premier League title race. But it was Rangers, who remain in the bottom three in spite of picking up a point against the champions, who were left aggrieved not to gain all three with referee Mike Dean the centre of attention. City and Joe Hart had a lucky escape on eight minutes when Austin – who moments earlier had a goal ruled out for offside – profited from a weak free kick by the England goalkeeper to fire in. Hart indicated to Dean he had accidentally taken two touches and the effort was disallowed, prompting protests from the home players. QPR were up in arms again when Hart denied Austin with a fine save on 14 minutes after Bobby Zamora caused chaos in the City defence. From the resulting corner, there was a huge appeal for handball against Bacary Sagna as the ball appeared to strike the former Arsenal defender on the arm but Dean waved away the protests. Dean continued to be the target for the home fans’ ire when he booked Sandro for a lunge on Yaya Toure moments after letting a sliding challenge by Gael Clichy on Eduardo Vargas go unpunished Redknapp pleased with performance Redknapp pleased with performance Austin finally got the better of Hart when he beat City’s offside trap on 20 minutes to latch onto Vargas’ pass to shoot beyond the England keeper for his sixth goal of the season. City were struggling to get a foothold in the game but Toure fired in a terrific left-foot curler which narrowly cleared the bar. But Aguero got City level when he superbly controlled Eliaquim Mangala’s long ball before turning inside Steven Caulker and firing beyond Rob Green, who protested furiously that the Argentine used his hand in the build-up. A bad slip by Fernando allowed Austin the chance to put the home side back in front but again Hart was alert to deny the striker. Pellegrini praises fight Pellegrini praises fight The Rangers goal led a charmed life in the opening minutes of the second half as three times the ball was slid across the home side’s six yard box but Aguero (twice) and Toure could not find the vital finish. Caulker inadvertently almost put QPR back into the lead on 63 minutes when Vargas’ shot hit him but the ball drifted narrowly wide of the City goal. City introduced Edin Dzeko for Fernandinho on 65 minutes in a bid to offer support to Aguero but the Bosnian international limped off moments later to be replaced by Frank Lampard. And it was Rangers who re-took the lead on 75 minutes when Austin’s cross was turned into his own net by Demichelis, under pressure from Zamora. City were almost back level straight away when substitute Joey Barton’s awful header back towards Green was latched onto by Aguero, who rounded the Rangers keeper but Richard Dunne got back to clear off the line. Austin reacts to disallowed goal Austin reacts to disallowed goal Another goalline clearance by Caulker and then the legs of Green denied City once more with ten minutes remaining as the champions sought another equaliser. But that man Aguero did level things up with seven minutes left when he picked up Toure’s chip to wrong foot Dunne and beat Green. Both sides went all out for the winner in the closing moments with Austin heading narrowly wide and Green racing off his line to deny Aguero a hat-trick but it was the home team who were left to feel they had deserved more than a point when Dean blew for full-time."},{"date": "03/11/2015", "arena": "Selhurst Park", "attendance": 23212, "home_team": {"name": "Crystal Palace", "lineup": [{"name":

3-1 win over Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park.

Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher believe Sunderland need to make the most of Steven Fletcher's aerial ability Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher believe Sunderland need to make the most of Steven Fletcher's aerial ability Palace then lost captain Mile Jedinak when he received his second yellow card of the night and their misery was complete when Fletcher notched Sunderland’s third in stoppage-time. The hosts began the match well and could easily have had a penalty inside the opening 30 seconds when Fraizer Campbell burst into the box and appeared to be tripped by Santiago Vergini but referee Phil Dowd did not spot the infringement. Gomez smashed a free-kick from a dangerous area straight into the wall at the other end but Palace were soon back on the front foot and Wilfried Zaha sent over a dangerous cross which neither Campbell nor Marouane Chamakh could quite get on the end of.

Wes Brown’s own goal was another calamitous effort and the fourth Sunderland have conceded already this season. Talking Point: Would the match have been a different story had Palace been successful in a penalty appeal in the opening seconds? However, it was Sunderland who took the lead when they worked the ball neatly down the left, before Patrick van Aanholt floated over a cross which Fletcher (31) skilfully nodded into the corner from just to the right of the penalty spot. Palace tried to respond and had another penalty shout when the lively Zaha went down as Van Aanholt challenged but Dowd was unmoved again. Van Aanholt unfortunately picked up a shoulder injury as the duo went to ground and had to be stretchered off, to be replaced by Brown who had been dropped to the bench after an error against Arsenal last week. Gus Poyet has claimed his Sunderland side finally got the luck they deserved in their 3-1 win Gus Poyet has claimed his Sunderland side finally got the luck they deserved in their 3-1 win Sunderland were buoyed by their goal in general and Fletcher tested keeper Julian Speroni with a thumping shot from a tricky angle before the Palace keeper made a more comfortable save from a weak Connor Wickham header. The visitors were knocking it around nicely and they strung together a long passing sequence just before the break which ended with Vergini drawing a decent save from Speroni after being picked out by Will Buckley. Palace flew out of the traps again after the interval and Zaha had a seemingly goal-bound shot blocked by Brown, and then tested Costel Pantilimon, a replacement in goal for Vito Mannone for Sunderland. Neil Warnock has claimed he is left bewildered by the standard of refereeing in the Premier League Neil Warnock has claimed he is left bewildered by the standard of refereeing in the Premier League Pantilimon then produced a superb save to claw away a Chamakh header from a Zaha cross but Campbell cleverly back-heeled the ball back into the danger area and it somehow bounced in off the unfortunate Brown (55) at the near post to give Palace a bizarre equaliser. Undaunted, Sunderland tried to re-take the lead and Speroni did well to beat away another Vergini piledriver after a good knock-down from Brown, before Pantilimon stretched to push a dangerous Zaha cross to safety at the other end. The Sunderland keeper then picked up a yellow card for dawdling over a free-kick, although it quickly became clear that Gus Poyet’s team were not going to sit back and play for a point. Steven Fletcher was man-of-the-match after scoring two goals Steven Fletcher was man-of-the-match after scoring two goals Buckley made progress down the right, cut inside and then slid a nice pass to Gomez (79), who found the corner of the net with a delightful first-time finish from the edge of the box which left Speroni with no chance. There was still plenty of time left but Palace then lost Jedinak, shown a second yellow for kicking out at Gomez after the pair had gone to ground. Sunderland had been beaten 8-0 at Southampton on their last Premier League away trip but it was a different story here and they made sure of the points when Liam Bridcutt robbed fellow sub Jason Puncheon and played in Fletcher (90), who calmly flicked the ball past Speroni with the outside of his foot to seal the victory.

United were reduced to 10 men late on in the first half when Chris Smalling was sent off for two bookable offences in the space of eight minutes. After seeing three penalty claims turned down Aguero grabbed the crucial breakthrough for Manchester City just past the hour mark with a fine finish United threw everything at City in the closing stages with Angel di Maria seeing a shot superbly saved by Joe Hart and Marouane Fellaini wasting a good opening as the home side were forced to hang on against the 10 men of United. Best of the match Man of the match: Yaya Toure has had his critics this season but the midfield totem was omni-present today and his tireless energy in a forward role in the final quarter was pivotal in getting a tiring City over the line today. Save of the match: Joe Hart taks this one for his crucial sprawling save from Angel Di Maria's low drive as the 10-men enjoyed a decent 10 minute spell in the second half. He had to be strong to push the ball away from danger too. Attempt of the match: Toure rolled back the years with a Cryuff turn late on and his curling attempt to find the bottom corner from 22 yards whistled narrowly wide. Moment of the match: Sergio Aguero had endured a frustrating afternoon - with penalty appeals ignored and chances limited - but once again he was Johnny-on-the-spot to sweep home the decisive goal. Talking point: City will be relieved to have steadied the ship with this derby win but this was far from comfortable against a side who played with 10-men for 52 minutes. Still plenty for Manuel Pellegrini to chew over. After a fast and frenetic start City created the first chance of the game on eight minutes when Aguero picked up a pass from James Milner and cut inside Antonio Valencia before firing in a shot which was punched away by David De Gea. Two minutes later United had an opening when Robin van Persie headed the ball down into the path of Adnan Januzaj on the edge of the box, but the midfielder dragged his shot wide of the target. Aguero looked like he was in the mood to score and he fashioned an opportunity for himself on 20 minutes when he brilliantly brought down Fernando's pass upfield, but after being pushed wide by Marcos Rojo he failed to get enough power on his shot to trouble De Gea. De Gea came to United's rescue twice in the space of a minute with two superb saves to deny Jesus Navas and Aguero. Aguero created the first chance for Navas when he spotted his run into the box, but the winger saw his shot kept out by De Gea and seconds later the United goalkeeper bravely denied Aguero from close-range after Fernando had picked out the Argentine striker inside the box with a brilliant cross from the left. Smalling picked up his first booking on 31 minutes for needlessly charging down a Joe Hart kick as he tried to set City away on the counter attack. The United defender was made to pay for that silly booking eight minutes later when he was shown a second yellow card for a late challenge on James Milner leaving the visitors to play 50 minutes with just 10 men. City had strong claims for a penalty rejected three minutes before the break when Marouane Fellaini, who was filling in at centre-half following Smalling's dismissal, appeared to bring down Aguero inside the box, but referee Michael Oliver waved away their appeals. Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal told Sky Sports he was proud of his team's performance against rivals Manchester City, but was disappointed they l Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal told Sky Sports he was proud of his team's performance against rivals Manchester City, but was disappointed they l Louis van Gaal decided to shuffle his pack soon after when he brought on Michael Carrick for Januzaj to help fill the void left by Smalling's early exit. City poured forward in search of a goal and they felt they should have won a penalty right on the stroke of half-time when Yaya Toure appeared to be caught by Rojo's outstretched leg as the Ivorian tried to get on the end of Stevan Jovetic's chipped pass. As expected, it was one-way traffic at the start of the second half and United suffered another defensive blow on 53 minutes when Rojo was forced off with an apparent shoulder problem with youngster Paddy McNair coming on in his place to leave the visitors with a real makeshift back four of Carrick, McNair, Valencia and Luke Shaw. City had strong claims for a penalty - their third of the game - on the hour mark when Aguero weaved his way into the box before appearing to be clipped by Carrick, but again referee Oliver ignored the home side's appeals. Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini believes patience was the key in his team's 1-0 win over rivals Manchester United. Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini believes patience was the key in his team's 1-0 win over rivals Manchester United. Two minutes later City did make their numerical advantage count with Aguero breaking the deadlock with his 10th Premier League goal of the season. Toure unlocked the United defence with a fine through-ball for Clichy down the left and he superbly pulled the ball back for Aguero to slam his left-footed shot high into the net past De Gea. United went close to an equaliser on 70 minutes when out of nothing van Persie beat Martin Demichelis and Clichy down the left and fired in a shot which Hart kept out with his legs at his near post. City were inches away from doubling their lead 15 minutes from time when Toure picked out Navas' run into the box, but under pressure from Shaw he drilled his shot against the post. Despite being down to ten men United almost grabbed a leveller on 77 minutes when Wayne Rooney burst through the middle and beat a couple of City defenders before going down in the box and the loose ball dropped to Di Maria who fired in a right-footed shot which was brilliantly saved by Hart low down to his right. A minute later Fellaini wasted a great opening when he lost his marker Vincent Kompany to get on the end of Di Maria's free-kick, but he got his header all wrong with his effort coming off his shoulder and well wide of the target. Toure went close to easing City's nerves in the final minute when he skilfully turned McNair on the edge of the box and curled his shot just wide of the target, but it did not matter as City held on to take all three points and close the gap on leaders Chelsea to six points."},{"date": "02/11/2015", "arena": "Villa Park", "attendance": 32049, "home_team": {"name": "Aston Villa", "lineup":

return to winning ways in the Premier League with a 2-1 victory over Aston Villa, who had Christian Benteke sent off. Belgium striker Benteke was dismissed after 65 minutes at Villa Park following a skirmish with young Spurs midfielder Ryan Mason ahead of Nacer Chadli firing in his fifth league goal of the season in the 84th minute which looked like snatching a point for the visitors. But Kane's deadball effort was then deflected by Nathan Baker's head past his own goalkeeper Brad Guzan to lift the north Londoners up to eighth in the table and stretch Villa's run of league defeats to six. Andreas Weimann had earlier ended 547 barren minutes in front of the goal for the hosts with a wonderful opportunist effort. The Austrian forward slid home Charles N'Zogbia's cross to end Villa's scoreless nine hours in front of goal in some style. Best of the match: Man of the Match: Nacer Chadli. The Belgian not only grabbed Spurs’ leveller, but he worked his socks off throughout and was involved in most of the team’s better moves. Goal of the Match: Harry Kane. The Spurs youngster stepped up to the plate (not literally) and secured all three points for the visitors with a free-kick that deflected off Nathan Baker. Moment of the Match: The turning point was clearly Christian Benteke’s dismissal. It was a nothing shove on Ryan Mason’s face, but when you raise your hands you run the risk of being sent off. Stat of the Match: Harry Kane has scored nine goals in 13 appearances in all competitions this term. Talking point: Is Paul Lambert the man to turn things around at Aston Villa? Should Harry Kane start Spurs’ next Premier League game? It was Villa's worst run in front of goal in their 140-year history but it was Spurs striker Robert Soldado who missed the first decent chance of the game for the visitors with his head. Harry Kane was the hero for Tottenham as he came off the bench to clinch the winner for Spurs in their 2-1 win over Aston Villa. Harry Kane was the hero for Tottenham as he came off the bench to clinch the winner for Spurs in their 2-1 win over Aston Villa. Benteke then almost broke the 50-day drought for Villa in the 13th minute. The robust striker pulled away to meet a cross from the left and cannoned a fierce left-foot drive against the outside of the post from 15 yards out. Villa Park would only have to wait three minutes before the deadlock was broken as N'Zogbia, in for the dropped forward Gabriel Agbonlahor, broke down the right and crossed for Weimann to brilliantly slide the ball past Hugo Lloris in the Spurs goal.

Tottenham had a clear chance to equalise when Christian Eriksen played in Emmanuel Adebayor to go one-on-one with Guzan but the Togo forward's tentative shot was well turned away by the United States goalkeeper. Weimann, fresh from his third goal of the season, hooked a Villa cross over Lloris's crossbar ahead of the industrious Benteke flicking the outside of the post with a looping header ahead of half-time. After he saw his Tottenham side beat 10-men Aston Villa, manager Mauricio Pochettino believed his side were worthy of the three points. After he saw his Tottenham side beat 10-men Aston Villa, manager Mauricio Pochettino believed his side were worthy of the three points. With both clubs desperate for something from the game it turned somewhat bad-tempered after the interval. And Benteke received a straight red card with 25 minutes to go for raising his hand to Mason after the English midfielder had pushed his head into the Belgian. Spurs sensed blood but it would take until the 84th minute for the unmarked Chadli to volley home substitute Erik Lamela's corner to equalise at the far post. The stage was set for a grandstand finish and, after Carlos Sanchez hauled down Andros Townsend, Kane snatched the ball off Lamela to hit a Spurs free-kick in off Baker for a priceless winner and a

Perez: Fires Newcastle ahead past Mignolet Newcastle recorded their fourth straight victory as substitute Ayoze Perez secured them a 1-0 home win over Liverpool. The marked upturn in form for Alan Pardew's Magpies continued on Saturday as Perez - the match-winner at Tottenham in their last league outing - struck the only goal of the game in the 73rd minute at St James' Park, following a defensive mistake by Alberto Moreno. Pardew: Four wins in a row for Magpies The three points moved Newcastle up to ninth ahead of the rest of the weekend's top-flight action, just one point behind the seventh-place Reds. Pardew made significant changes after Wednesday's 2-0 Capital One Cup victory at Manchester City with Rob Elliot, Massadio Haidara, Ryan Taylor, Rolando Aarons and Adam Armstrong making way for Tim Krul, Steven Taylor, Moussa Sissoko, Sammy Ameobi and Papiss Cisse. Best of the Match Man of the match: Fabricio Coloccini. Woeful as Liverpool were in attack, Coloccini gave them nothing all afternoon as Newcastle’s confidence gradually grew. Coloccini and Taylor’s control provided the foundations for Newcastle’s subs to seize control further forward and deservedly take all three points. Save of the match: In a game of few chances, Krul’s best work in turning behind a Coutinho header was rendered irrelevant by a linesman’s flag so the award goes to Mignolet for saving with his feet when Cabella was clean through. Attempt of the match: Skrtel’s bullet header from a first-half corner that whistled just the wrong side of the upright for Liverpool. Moment of the match: Pardew took a risk in making his third and final substitution as early as the 66th minute, but the lively Cabella was – along with half-time sub and goalscorer Perez – instrumental in Newcastle’s ultimately decisive added threat going forward. Talking point: Newcastle into the top half a fortnight after being in the bottom three, but the focus will surely be on Liverpool’s faltering campaign. A fourth defeat already, and they could be 15 points adrift of the leaders with defeat to Chelsea next weekend. Mario Balotelli returned to Liverpool's starting line-up after scoring his first goal in nine games against Swansea in midweek. The Italian striker was one of seven changes to the side which progressed to the Capital One Cup quarter-finals as he, Simon Mignolet, Moreno, Martin Skrtel, Steven Gerrard, Joe Allen and Raheem Sterling replaced Rickie Lambert, Brad Jones, Javier Manquillo, Kolo Toure, Lucas Leiva, Lazar Markovic and Fabio Borini. After Skrtel deflected a fourth-minute Cisse shot wide, Newcastle had a penalty appeal turned down when Allen challenged Sissoko in the Liverpool penalty area, but Andre Marriner quickly waved play on. The visitors were noticeably struggling to impose themselves on the game, with lone striker Balotelli and wide-man Sterling too often isolated whereas holding midfielder Mehdi Abeid was coming to the fore for the hosts. Gabriel Obertan had to be stretchered off on 27 minutes with what looked to be a torn thigh muscle, allowing midweek goal hero Aarons to enter the fray. Obertan: Stretchered off in first half Mignolet needed the help of defender Glen Johnson to head Cisse's 37th-minute shot off the line but it was Skrtel who had the best chance of the first half when he flashed a header wide of the post in the 40th minute from Gerrard's corner. Cisse might have caused problems for Mignolet in injury time after Skrtel had been booked for a cynical trip on Sissoko two yards outside the penalty area, but the Senegal international lifted his effort high over the bar. Perez replaced Cisse - who had been struggling with a knee problem - before the restart, and Sissoko was somewhat fortunate to only receive a booking soon after for a studs-up challenge on Allen. Cisse: Tries his luck with first-half free-kick The visitors went close five minutes after the interval when Balotelli forced a solid save from Krul with a dipping, swerving free-kick, and the Holland international had to pluck another effort from the Italian out of the air five minutes later. In the 57th minute, Krul made a superb one-handed save to his left to keep out Philippe Coutinho's header from a Gerrard cross from the right - but the flag had already been raised for offside. Gerrard was playing significantly higher up the pitch and was far more effective as a result, although full-back Paul Dummett gave the visitors something to think about when he strode forward on the hour and blasted a left-foot drive just over. Ameobi and Gerrard: Tangle on Tyneside Remy Cabella came on for Ameobi and Borini replaced Allen midway through the second period as Pardew and Brendan Rodgers looked to spice up their attacks. The home side picked up the pace and drove Liverpool back towards their own goal as the half wore on, but with Gerrard pulling the strings, the Reds were a different proposition and Borini fired wide from distance after running on to Sterling's 70th-minute lay-off. Perez: Celebrates with Cabella Liverpool took a more direct approach in their search to break the deadlock, but ended up being punished by Perez. After a one-two with Dummett, Sissoko's pass intended for Cabella was intercepted but crucially not cleared by the stumbling Moreno, allowing Newcastle's Spanish ace to hammer the loose ball home. Mignolet made an impressive save shortly afterwards to deny Cabella after a quick break involving Perez, while the visitors pushed for an equaliser at the other end - but to no avail. Newcastle's next assignment is away to West Brom on Sunday week. Liverpool, who failed to score away from home in the league for the first time in almost a year, are away to Real Madrid in the Champions League on Tuesday night before then hosting Chelsea next

took until the 70th minute for Alexis Sanchez to put Arsenal ahead Alexis Sanchez scored twice as Arsenal moved into the top four courtesy of a 3-0 victory over a resilient Burnley. The Gunners were frustrated for 70 minutes at the Emirates as they were unable to make their vastly superior possession count against a well-drilled Clarets side. Best of the match Man of the match: Alexis Sanchez. The Arsenal forward not only scored two goals, one of which decisively broke the deadlock in a previously tight match, but worked tirelessly for his side throughout. Save of the match: Tom Heaton produced plenty of top-class saves, but his best was arguably the reflex one to deny Lukas Podolski's volley from point-blank range Moment of the match: The return of Theo Walcott as a late substitute for his first appearance since January following a knee injury received one of the biggest cheers of the afternoon. Talking point: Burnley became the 10th team to fail to win any of their opening 10 games of the Premier League season.. The Clarets have shown plenty of fight so far, but is this simply a level too high for them? But the deadlock was finally broken by Sanchez, who rose highest in the box to head in a Callum Chambers cross. Two minutes later, Chambers went from provider to scorer by latching on to a loose ball in the box to hammer home following a corner. And in the final minute, Sanchez grabbed his second by collecting Kieran Gibbs' low cross in the box and finishing from close range. The scoreline could have been even greater were it not for Burnley keeper Tom Heaton, who produced a string of superb saves to deny the Gunners, most notably a point-blank block from the volley of substitute Lukas Podolski late in the second half, and the woodwork, which the German struck with a fierce volley. Calum Chambers was delighted to score his first goal for Arsenal Calum Chambers was delighted to score his first goal for Arsenal The keeper also produced a fine diving save to deny an angled drive from Theo Walcott, who came off the bench to make his first appearance since January following a serious knee injury. The win lifts the Gunners up to fourth in the table but still nine points behind league-leaders Chelsea, who beat QPR on Saturday. Arsene Wenger was pleased with Arsenal's performance Arsene Wenger was pleased with Arsenal's performance It also extends their unbeaten home run in the league to an impressive 23 games.

Burnley manager Sean Dyche believes Arsenal's superior quality made the difference Burnley manager Sean Dyche believes Arsenal's superior quality made the difference They are not beyond salvation yet but with the gap between themselves and 17th place now at five points they have an increasingly difficult task to extend their top-flight stay into a second season. However, as has often been the case this season, this was a defeat from which the Clarets can take plenty of positives. For much of the match they stifled their vastly superior opponents, yielding plenty of possession but giving away relatively few chances, with a couple of wayward Sanchez shots from range and Cazorla's volleyed effort past the post the closest the home side came to scoring in the first half. Heaton reflects on tough loss Heaton reflects on tough loss As the game wore on, Sean Dyche's side began to grow in belief of earning an unlikely point. But in Sanchez, Arsenal had the best player on the pitch and he showed superb desire to get on the end of Chambers cross to head in and break not only the deadlock, but Burnley's belief. Soon after, Chambers wrapped up the game by burying a lose ball after Heaton had saved Danny Welbeck's shot following a corner. In the dying moments, Sanchez grabbed his second with a neat finish inside the box to make it 10 goals in his last 12 games."},{"date": "01/11/2015", "arena": "Stamford Bridge", "attendance": 41486, "home_team": {"name": "Chelsea", "lineup": [{"name": "Thibaut Courtois", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Branislav Ivanovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gary Cahill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Terry", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Filipe Luis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cesc Fàbregas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nemanja Matic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willian", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [64]}, {"name": "Oscar", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eden Hazard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Diego Costa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [78]}], "subs": [{"name": "Kurt Zouma", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathan Aké", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ramires", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Didier Drogba", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [64], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mohamed Salah", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Petr Cech", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "André Schürrle", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [78], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Queens Park Rangers", "lineup": [{"name": "Robert Green", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mauricio Isla", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Richard Dunne", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Caulker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Suk-Young Yun", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eduardo Vargas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Karl Henry", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sandro", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Junior Hoilett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [60]}, {"name": "Leroy Fer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [84]}, {"name": "Charlie Austin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Armand Traore", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [84], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Clint Hill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matt Phillips", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shaun Wright-Phillips", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Niko Kranjcar", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Brian Murphy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bobby Zamora", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [60], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Chelsea's Oscar (right) celebrates scoring the opening goal against QPR. Chelsea moved nine points clear of Manchester City at the top of the Premier League as they maintained their 100 per cent home record - but they had to dig deep before sealing a 2-1 win over battling Queens Park Rangers. Rangers were surprise winners at Stamford Bridge two seasons ago but there looked to be little chance of a repeat after Oscar gave Jose Mourinho's side a deserved first-half advantage. Best of the Match Man of the match: Oscar scored a truly magnificent goal to hand his side the first-half lead, while he crafted several chances for his side. Goal of the match: Oscar's delightful, first-time strike with the outside of his right foot which snuck in off the far post after another good Cesc Fabregas assist. Moment of the match: A sigh of relief going around the ground when Eden Hazard slotted home the winning goal from the penalty spot. Attempt of the match: Sandro's effort from the edge of the box, which was deflected inches wide of the upright. Save of the match: Robert Green getting back across to get a strong hand to a close-range John Terry from a corner. Talking point: QPR with a decent showing at Stamford Bridge, making Chelsea work very hard for the three points. But QPR found renewed belief after the break, Charlie Austin equalising with a deft flick before Eduardo Vargas' rash challenge allowed Hazard to win it from the penalty spot. Chelsea were soon on the offensive and forced a series of corners as QPR's defence dug in for a testing afternoon. Oscar side-footed wide from 10 yards as the home side continued to dominate, readily switching the ball from one flank to the other. Willian, always a threat on the right, then worked some space and Bransilav Ivanovic flicked his cross into the side-netting at the near post. Jose Mourinho was less than impressed with Chelsea's performance despite the 2-1 victory over QPR. Jose Mourinho was less than impressed with Chelsea's performance despite the 2-1 victory over QPR. Rangers did manage to break the shackles, but Austin could not get any power on his header, while Leroy Fer failed to pick the right option after a promising surge through the middle. Cesc Fabregas had Rob Green at full stretch before the Chelsea midefielder was heavily involved in the opening goal in the 32nd minute. After Oscar's opener in Chelsea's win over QPR, team-mate Eden Hazard was quick to praise the Brazilian After Oscar's opener in Chelsea's win over QPR, team-mate Eden Hazard was quick to praise the Brazilian He took a return pass from Diego Costa on the edge of the area before picking out Oscar on the right of the area and the Brazilian coolly bent the ball beyond Green with the outside of his right boot. Green had to be on his toes to prevent an opening for the lively Costa, and the Chelsea striker threatened again after Willian had picked him out at the far post. QPR manager Harry Redknapp felt the penalty awarded to Chelsea for their winning goal was harsh QPR manager Harry Redknapp felt the penalty awarded to Chelsea for their winning goal was harsh Junior Hoilett came off for Bobby Zamora and moments later the visitors were level thanks to Austin's impudence in the 62nd minute. Chelsea keeper Thibaut Courtois fisted Vargas' driven shot out to the edge of the area where Fer volleyed towards goal without much conviction, but Austin's clever back-heel from seven yards wrong-footed Courtois to spark wild celebrations in the away end. Renewed belief flooded through the Rangers' ranks and Sandro's low shot crept narrowly past the post, but Green was soon back in action at the other end, shepherding Oscar's free-kick past the post. Rob Green believes QPR can take positives from their performance Rob Green believes QPR can take positives from their performance Zamora teed up Austin for a 20-yard shot but it flew well wide as the game opened up, but Vargas' rush of blood was to prove costly as he clattered into Hazard on the left-hand edge of the area and the Belgian calmly sent Green (75) the wrong way from the spot. Gary Cahill slid in to deny Zamora as QPR continued to press, while John Terry's header drew a good stop from Green before Chelsea were finally able to celebrate their victory. The three points kept Chelsea four points ahead of second-placed Southampton, who continued their superb run with a 1-0 win at Hull City, in the Premier League table. Charlie Nicholas' view Chelsea deserved to win, but it wasn’t a sparkling performance. It was a grafting performance, but credit to Queens Park Rangers, who put on a very decent show. Their defensive organisation was good, but they did park the bus. They were cautious and had Charlie Austin up front on his own, but they worked the flanks really well and the balance was pretty impressive. For me it’s not a penalty.

Former Liverpool midfielder Jonjo Shelvey was dismissed for a second bookable offence 18 minutes from time after blocking the path of James McCarthy, but the Swans dug deep to hold out for a point. The visitors may have felt aggrieved after referee Kevin Friend rejected a strong penalty appeal when Shelvey's effort on goal in the first-half struck Antolin Alcaraz's hand. Best of the Match: Man of the match: Seamus Coleman - The full-back was in outstanding form like he has been all season. Moment of the match: Swansea should have been handed a penalty when Jonjo Shelvey's shot was clearly handled by Antolin Alcaraz. Chance of the match: Romelu Lukaku failed to connect with a cross in stoppage-time which would have won it. Red card of the match: Former Liverpool man Shelvey was shown a second yellow for blocking James McCarthy. He trudged off down the tunnel with thousands of delirious Evertonians waving him off. Stat of the match: Everton have never lost to Swansea City in the league (19 games and counting). The hosts, who had lacked vigour throughout, failed to make the most of their numerical advantage and make it a hat-trick of Premier League wins. They did have some late pressure but Steven Pienaar had a shot deflected wide and substitute Romelu Lukaku failed to connect with a cross in stoppage-time. But aside from a bright start by both teams, the game was largely a timid affair with Swansea perhaps squandering the best chance when Wilfried Bony shot wide early on. Everton did have some clear-cut chances but Lukasz Fabianksi did not have to make a significant save. They could have made a perfect start when Gareth Barry seized on a poor clearance by Angel Rangel to set up Samuel Eto'o but the veteran striker shot straight at Fabianski. Bony then spurned his gilt-edged chance in the fourth minute when he was played through by Gylfi Sigurdsson. Everton stood still expecting an offside flag that never came and they were relieved when Bony guided his low shot wide. The lively start continued as Ross Barkley had a shot blocked for a corner and both sides hand penalty shouts for handball in quick succession. Swansea were the first to be denied after Aiden McGeady gifted possession to Shelvey and his shot appeared to strike the outstretched hand of Antolin Alcarez. Former team-mates Roberto Martinez and Garry Monk enjoy a chat Former team-mates Roberto Martinez and Garry Monk enjoy a chat Shelvey protested but referee Kevin Friend gave nothing and his lingering frustration was evident when he was booked for kicking the ball away after conceding a foul soon after. But whatever his grievance, it was needless and something he would later come to regret. Everton then appealed for handball when McGeady had a fierce shot blocked but a corner was all they were given. Everton were forced to make a change 32 minutes after Alcaraz appeared to injure his shoulder in an aerial collision with Bony. The luckless Paraguayan, whose first season with the Toffees was ravaged by injuries, had been making only his fourth appearance of the campaign. Muhamed Besic took his place with Barry dropping back into defence. Garry Monk admits he is concerned with Jonjo Shelvey's disciplinary record after the Swansea midfielder's red card at Everton Garry Monk admits he is concerned with Jonjo Shelvey's disciplinary record after the Swansea midfielder's red card at Everton After that high-tempo opening, the first half petered out although Everton went close as both Eto'o and Steven Naismith failed to get a touch to a ball that ran across the area. Swansea had the first opportunity of the second half after Bony created an opening by beating Phil Jagielka with a neat turn but Shelvey dragged a shot wide. Sigurdsson also volleyed over. Everton struggled to create any momentum and it was not until just after the hour they were presented with another opportunity as a misplaced Ashley Williams header fell to Naismith. The Scot broke clear and checked back to find McGeady but his shot curled narrowly wide. Everton felt they were denied a good advantage when Friend halted play to book Sigurdsson after the Iceland international had held back Besic before he played what looked like a good through-ball. Roberto Martinez believes that Jonjo Shelvey's sending-off made it more difficult for Everton to win Roberto Martinez believes that Jonjo Shelvey's sending-off made it more difficult for Everton to win The Merseysiders finally began to look more like themselves and McCarthy looked to be advancing into a shooting position when Shelvey cynically stepped across to block him. He pleaded innocence but Friend deemed it a clear bookable offence and therefore had no option but to send him off. That should have given Everton the impetus they needed but Swansea acquitted themselves well and McCarthy was lucky to escape a booking after crudely hacking down Neil Taylor. Lukaku gave Everton a different target in the latter stages but Williams did his defensive duty to clear one dangerous Leighton Baines cross. Pienaar had an opening but saw a good effort deflected wide and Lukaku was agonisingly short of turning in a low cross with what would have been the last touch of the game. Alan McInally’s verdict I keep banging the drum, but Ashley Williams is a Premier League defender of top class. I’m sure plenty of people think they might have nicked him away from Swansea in the summer. I’ve got to say Fernandez, next to him, was excellent and the full-backs were good as well. They battled really hard and they had to because there was loads and loads of possession for Everton and they just couldn’t break them down, even though they went down to 10 men. That was Jonjo Shelvey’s fault for starters. He got the first yellow card for kicking the ball away, but I’ve got to say the second yellow card I fee for him a little bit because it was more of a block and McCarthy ran into him. There was not a lot he could do about it."},{"date": "01/11/2015", "arena": "KCOM Stadium", "attendance": 22828, "home_team": {"name": "Hull City", "lineup": [{"name": "Eldin Jakupovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Chester", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paul McShane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [64]}, {"name": "Curtis Davies", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ahmed Elmohamady", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jake Livermore", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mohamed Diamé", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Huddlestone", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robbie Brady", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [83]}, {"name": "Hatem Ben Arfa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [72]}, {"name": "Abel Hernandez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Liam Rosenior", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Meyler", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Maguire", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sone Aluko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [64], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andrew Robertson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [72], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stephen Quinn", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [83], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rory Watson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Southampton", "lineup": [{"name": "Fraser Forster", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathaniel Clyne", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "José Fonte", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Toby Alderweireld", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Bertrand", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Davis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Wanyama", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Morgan Schneiderlin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shane Long", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [62]}, {"name": "Graziano Pellè", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dusan Tadic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [81]}], "subs": [{"name": "Kelvin Davis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Maya Yoshida", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Florin Gardos", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sadio Mané", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [62], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Cork", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [81], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Emmanuel Mayuka", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harrison Reed", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Victor Wanyama’s long-range effort was enough to earn second-placed Southampton a 1-0 win away at Hull City. The only goal of Saturday's Premier League game arrived in the third minute, with third-choice goalkeeper Eldin Jakupovic enduring a moment to forget for the hosts. His poor clearance fell kindly at the feet of Wanyama, who still had a lot to do from 40 yards out. Best of the match Man of the match: Victor Wanyama. Fantastic strike to seal the points and a physical presence in the middle of the park that helped to frustrate Hull City. Miss of the match: Sadio Mane will be relieved to see Southampton take the spoils after somehow bouncing an effort from four yards out wide of the target with the sole of his boot. Moment of the match: Eldin Jakupovic is a Premier League novice and was made to pay the ultimate price as his poor clearance presented Wanyama with a clear sight of goal. Talking point: Where are the goals going to start coming from for Hull City? Which Southampton Englishman will have impressed the watching Roy Hodgson the most? The Kenyan returned the ball with interest, though, into an unguarded net, with his composed finish sealing a 10th victory for Southampton in their last 11 outings in all competitions. Attention For England manager Roy Hodgson, making a first trip to the KC Stadium since taking the national team post, there was little outstanding from the six eligible players. Fraser Forster and Nathaniel Clyne did nothing to play their way out of contention but team-mate Ryan Bertrand and the Hull hopefuls Tom Huddlestone, Curtis Davies and Jake Livermore did not demand attention. The defining moment of the first half, and ultimately the match, came almost immediately. Robbie Brady's back-pass left plenty to be desired but Jakupovic should still have been able to get the ball clear. Instead he miskicked straight along the ground to Wanyama and left himself stranded. Ronald Koeman says Southampton deserve to be where they are in the table Ronald Koeman says Southampton deserve to be where they are in the table The Kenyan still needed to find the net from his distant position and he finished with aplomb. Hull rallied quickly, Robbie Brady giving Clyne a couple of scares on the left and Mohamed Diame taking the midfield area by the scruff of the neck. Diame gathered Steven Davis' loose pass and dribbled into the area, exchanging a one-two with Abel Hernandez before seeing his drilled cross-shot cleared. Threatened Hatem Ben Arfa briefly threatened too, working Forster from the edge of the box then jinking his way to the byline before Southampton smothered his cutback. For all their energy, Hull were struggling to battle past Jose Fonte and Toby Alderweireld, who marshalled the back four superbly under pressure. Victory Wanyama sings the praises of Southampton manager Ronald Koeman Victory Wanyama sings the praises of Southampton manager Ronald Koeman The same could not be said of the Tigers defence, with Jakupovic's nerves seemingly spreading. Curtis Davies almost slipped in possession under pressure from Dusan Tadic and a moment of hesitation from Paul McShane put former Hull striker Shane Long through. The forward, a £12million summer signing, spared his fellow Irishman's blushes with a non-committal header. In the 35th minute he had an even better chance against his old side, teed up by Davis' neat pass, only to see a combination of McShane and Jakupovic block his shot. Hull needed to improve in the second half, Ben Arfa having gone quiet to leave Hernandez looking increasingly isolated. Steve Bruce believes his Hull side did not deserve anything from the game Steve Bruce believes his Hull side did not deserve anything from the game Diame had a half-hearted penalty appeal waved away after Wanyama's powerful challenge just after the restart but Hull were otherwise looking uninspired in the final third. Alert The game was nearly put to bed in the 57th minute when Graziano Pelle made the slightest connection with an overhead kick, wrong-footing the Hull defence as the ball bobbled through. Davis was alert, though, and looked certain to bury from close range when Jakupovic made a brave block. Hull boss Steve Bruce made a much-needed change with 25 minutes to go, Sone Aluko on for McShane and the system switched from 3-5-2 to 4-4-2. Hull City midfielder Tom Huddlestone believes Southampton are the strongest team they have played against this season and acknowledges his side's lack of i Hull City midfielder Tom Huddlestone believes Southampton are the strongest team they have played against this season and acknowledges his side's lack of i Southampton had already made their first substitution, Long hauled off for Sadio Mane after a modest showing on his old stomping ground. Mane had a nearly unmissable chance to secure the points in the 70th minute, meeting Tadic's cross a couple of yards out in a central position. But somehow he sent his shot into the ground and bouncing wide to widespread disbelief. Pelle, unusually quiet by his own recent standards, should have been on the scoresheet in the 89th minute but slotted into the side-netting from six yards. The vibrant away support had to make do with one goal despite their continued threat, Davis lashing the final chance into the stands. Phil Thompson's view Southampton thoroughly deserved it. In all departments they had the upper hand. The defenders did their jobs, the midfield was very good and was rotating and then there was the two players up front. Tadic was going left, right and long and stretching teams, while Pelle showed great hold-up play and proper centre-forward play. These were all positives and Ronald Koeman must be thinking this is easy. He has won seven out of the last eight Premier League games. It’s just astonishing what’s going on because this is a good team. There’s no real weaknesses. The only thing I would say is they should have scored more goals. Steve Bruce will be disappointed. He started off with his 3-5-1-1 formation, but Hernandez was just isolated at home. Brady shined playing at left wing-back, but they had just one shot at home in the whole of the 90 minutes.

A disappointing performance last weekend prompted Nigel Pearson to make four changes to the Leicester line-up as leading scorer Leonardo Ulloa, without a goal or a shot in his last four matches, was dropped to the bench. Marcin Wasilewski was among those to come in and he tested Ben Foster with an early header from Matty James' corner before the West Brom keeper almost got himself into trouble when he carried the ball suspiciously close to the edge of the penalty area. Saido Berahino looked dangerous with his pacey runs in behind Leicester's defence and with quarter of an hour gone, the in-form striker finally beat the hosts' offside trap but his shot was held by Kasper Schmeichel. Irvine's post-match reaction Irvine's post-match reaction At the other end, referee Stuart Attwell turned down two penalty appeals in quick succession as Craig Dawson met a Leicester free-kick with the top of his arm before Joleon Lescott cleared out both man and ball after Jamie Vardy had latched onto Craig Gardner's sloppy back-pass. It was from set-pieces that the home side looked most likely to break the deadlock. Morgan flashed a header wide from another James corner and moments later City's captain was involved again as the ball dropped to Danny Drinkwater eight yards out but the midfielder's shot was blocked. Pearson: Foxes will bounce back Pearson: Foxes will bounce back Leicester's encouraging first-half display was almost undone shortly before the break by a quick West Brom counter-attack as Stephane Sessegnon slid through Berahino, who teed up Chris Brunt on his favoured left foot but the winger fired over. Pearson had cause for optimism at the interval but two minutes after the restart, his side fell behind. Berahino was involved again, skipping in behind and as he cut the ball back, Morgan's attempted header away deflected back off Cambiasso and into the Leicester net. Foster hails 'ugly' win Foster hails 'ugly' win The home side cranked up the pressure as the hour-mark approached and Vardy could have equalised when Paul Konchesky's long ball forward caught West Brom napping but after cutting back onto his right foot, the striker drove straight at Foster. The Baggies had a strong case for a penalty when Sessegnon's chipped pass struck Wasilewski's hand but Leicester survived and Pearson threw on Ulloa for David Nugent with just over 20 minutes to play. The Argentine almost made a telling contribution straight away as his cross from the right found Andy King in the area but the unmarked midfielder could only find Foster with his header. Leicester's Matty James feels results aren't going his side's way Leicester's Matty James feels results aren't going his side's way Leicester continued to huff and puff in the dying minutes, bombarding West Brom's box with crosses and long throws but the visitors' defence held firm until the final whistle which was greeted with a chorus of boss from the home supporters. Matt Le Tissier's verdict Nigel Pearson will be very disappointed. Going forward, in the early weeks of the season Leicester looked threatening. Even in games where they didn’t take all three points they still looked like they were going to threaten the goal. At the moment they are not creating enough clear-cut chances to try and win Premier League football matches. The best they could come up with today was a header from Andy King straight at Foster. I saw their first three games and turned round and said they won’t go down because they have too much quality – and they did have at that point. Unfortunately when they have come up against the teams that will be around them in the league they haven’t come up with the goods. He will be massively disappointed, but on the other hand did they really deserve to lose this football match? Probably not. West Brom didn’t create very much either. It was a freak own goal. West Brom were equally as poor as Leicester and looking at it as a whole, I think a draw will be a fair result. I think West Brom will be absolutely delighted."},{"date": "01/11/2015", "arena": "Bet365 Stadium", "attendance": 27174, "home_team": {"name": "Stoke City", "lineup": [{"name": "Asmir Begovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Geoff Cameron", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Shawcross", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marc Wilson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Erik Pieters", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven N'Zonzi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steve Sidwell", "yellows": [54], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jon Walters", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bojan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [82]}, {"name": "Victor Moses", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mame Biram Diouf", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Marc Muniesa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stephen Ireland", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marko Arnautovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charlie Adam", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [82], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dionatan Teixeira", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Oussama Assaidi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Thomas Sorensen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "West Ham United", "lineup": [{"name": "Adrián", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Carl Jenkinson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Collins", "yellows": [66], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Winston Reid", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [24]}, {"name": "Aaron Cresswell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mark Noble", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [68]}, {"name": "Alex Song", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cheikhou Kouyaté", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stewart Downing", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Enner Valencia", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Morgan Amalfitano", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}], "subs": [{"name": "Kevin Nolan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [68], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Tomkins", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [24], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matthew Jarvis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mauro Zárate", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joey O'Brien", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jussi Jaaskelainen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Carlton Cole", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Stewart Downing celebrates with Kevin Nolan Stewart Downing scored one and set up another as West Ham fought back from two goals down to draw 2-2 with Stoke City at the Britannia Stadium.

Best of the match Man of the match: Bojan was brilliant for Stoke, putting in his best performance for the club so far, but Stewart Downing takes the honours for inspiring West Ham's comeback. Moment of the match: Just minutes before West Ham made it 2-2 the hosts had a superb chance to go 3-1 ahead but Diouf failed to hit the target with his header from a great position. Save of the match: With less than a minute remaining in the first half it looked as though Stoke would go in 2-0 up as Diouf turned Collins in the box. But Adrian did brilliantly to deny him with an outstretched leg. But West Ham halved the deficit on the hour mark when Downing whipped in an excellent ball for Enner Valencia to nod in. The visitors had barely threatened up until that point but they levelled in the 72nd minute when Downing drilled in a shot that Asmir Begovic could not keep out. The draw sees West Ham drop to fifth spot in the Premier League while Stoke slip down to 12th.

The right-hand side would prove to be a rich outlet for Stoke and they created another chance from there midway through the half when Bojan fired a wicked ball across the six-yard box that Diouf was just inches away from tapping in. West Ham’s early frustrations were added to when Winston Reid picked up an injury and had to be replaced by James Tomkins. But they could have taken the lead after 28 minutes as Alex Song teed up Downing with a delightful backheel but the winger fired wastefully over the bar. Stewart Downing hailed West Ham's team effort Stewart Downing hailed West Ham's team effort Minutes later the hosts edged ahead when Bojan saw a shot blocked by Collins and the ball fell to Moses, who managed to bundle it in from close range. It was no more than Stoke deserved and they almost doubled their advantage on the stroke of half-time when Diouf turned Collins but saw his shot brilliantly saved by Adrian. Still, it didn’t take Stoke long to make it 2-0 after the break as Walters did well to win the ball on the right and crossed for Diouf to head home. At that stage there only looked to be one winner and Moses almost made sure of victory as he curled an effort narrowly wide of the post.

They halved the deficit on the hour mark when Downing burst free down the right and curled in an excellent cross that Valencia stooped to head home. Stoke were aggrieved that play was not stopped in the build-up after a tough tackle by Song but they should have restored their two-goal advantage in the 70th minute when Diouf headed wide after a fine free-kick from Erik Pieters.

Watch Austin's opener with MNF analysis Watch Austin's opener with MNF analysis Charlie Austin opened the scoring on 17 minutes and added the second on 69 minutes to give QPR only their second win in the league this season. The first goal arrived when Bobby Zamona held off Ron Vlaar to knock a high punt from Richard Dunne down to the edge of the box and Austin hit the ball on the drop to send a low drive into the keeper’s right corner. Best of the Match Man of the Match: Charlie Austin scored both goals and his first was the pick of the pair as he arrowed a low, 20-yard effort into the bottom corner.

Talking Point: Villa have lost five consecutive league games without scoring for the first time in their history. What is going wrong? Austin took his tally for the season to four when he timed his run to perfection across Vlaar and clipped the ball between Brad Guzan and his near post from a weighted Eduardo Vargas cross. Villa had the first opportunity after Sandro played a slack pass to Aly Cissokho and as Rangers struggled to clear the ball from the penalty area Ashley Westwood tested Rob Green with a frim drive from 18 yards which the keeper held. Green was again called into action when Carlos Sanchez smacked a swerving volley from Mauricio Isla's clearance towards goal.

Super Sunday analysis: Can Everton make the top four? Super Sunday analysis: Can Everton make the top four? Lukaku felt the heat from some Everton fans after his mistake led to Danny Ings cancelling out Eto'o's early opener in the 20th minute at Turf Moor. The Belgium striker has not yet had the impact this campaign that he did during his loan spell with the Toffees last season but nine minutes after his blunder, he netted a fourth of the season. That would probably have been enough as Burnley once again fell short in their search for a first win of the season but Eto'o made sure with a fine third in the 85th minute. Everton boss Roberto Martinez decided against giving Ross Barkley a third start in a week on his return from injury, with Eto'o starting in his place. Best of the match Man of the match: Samuel Eto’o and Romelu Lukaku both started up front for Everton and although both were on the scoresheet, it was the Cameroon star who shone. He timed his run to perfection for the opening goal and demonstrated all his class with a long-range beauty late on. Goal of the match: Eto’o’s second goal was right out of the top drawer. Just when he had got a little quiet in the game, Eto’o stepped up with a 25-yard curler to put the game out of Burnley’s reach. Moment of the match: Eto’o again, as he came close to completing a hat-trick when rounding the goalkeeper and hitting the post from a very tight angle. The ball trickled back along the line and into Tom Heaton’s hands. Talking point: Burnley’s relegation battle looks a whole lot gloomier on the back of this display. Everton have struggled after midweek Europa League games earlier in the season and probably weren’t at their best here, but the Clarets didn’t pose them enough problems and look in deep trouble. Seamus Coleman, James McCarthy, Leon Osman and Steven Naismith, none of whom started the goalless Europa League draw in Lille on Thursday, were all back in. Burnley would have hoped to capitalise on any weariness Everton were feeling but instead it was the visitors who took the lead inside four minutes. Patient passing was rewarded when Osman fed Leighton Baines down the left and the full-back picked out Eto'o, whose powerful header beat Clarets goalkeeper Tom Heaton and went in off the crossbar. Burnley had played very well in the first half against West Ham last weekend before going down 3-1 but it was a different story this time as they struggled to keep the ball. Martinez: A satisfying win Martinez: A satisfying win Lukaku benefited from such generosity to fire in his first shot of the afternoon, but it slid just wide of the far post. Gradually the home side began to generate a bit of momentum, with Stephen Ward and David Jones both seeing shots blocked. But it was Lukaku's error that allowed them to pull level, inexplicably passing the ball straight to Lukas Jutkiewicz, who timed his through-ball to Ings perfectly. The striker showed excellent composure to round Tim Howard and slot into an empty net, becoming the first forward to score for Burnley this season. Ings' goal is bitter sweet Ings' goal is bitter sweet That lifted the hosts and Scott Arfield was a touch unfortunate to see his well-struck volley fly the wrong side of the post. However, nine minutes after conceding, Everton went back in front as Lukaku made amends for his earlier error. The striker received the ball from Naismith just inside the box and turned Jason Shackell. Lukaku's first effort was blocked by Ward but the ball rebounded to him and this time he managed to guide a shot into the bottom corner. It did not look the cleanest strike but Everton did not care, and they might have gone into half-time with a two-goal cushion. Dyche positive despite defeat Dyche positive despite defeat Heaton looked to have Naismith's header covered but flapped at it and was grateful to be able to grab the ball when it came back off the crossbar. It was a quieter start to the second half but Everton were mostly in control, with Eto'o seeing two long-range efforts comfortably saved by Heaton, who then scrambled Baines' free-kick round the post. Burnley boss Sean Dyche sent on Ashley Barnes for Jutkiewicz, while Barkley made his entrance in place of Lukaku with 25 minutes left. But the spark the home side needed to get back into the game remained elusive and the points were wrapped up five minutes from time when Eto'o turned 25 yards out and curled a terrific shot into the corner. The Cameroonian almost ended the game with the match ball after seizing on a misplaced back pass and rounding Heaton but his shot hit the inside of the far post and rolled along the goal line.

Alan Pardew's half-time substitutions inspired Newcastle to a much-needed victory. Pardew: A massive result Pardew: A massive result The Magpies are now up to 14th place in the table after recording only their second top-flight win of the season, while Spurs drop to 11th. Emmanuel Adebayor put the hosts in front in the 18th minute at White Hart Lane with his first goal since August. After Nacer Chadli and Christian Eriksen both had close-range shots blocked, Ryan Mason's cross from the left was headed home by Adebayor at the far post. Best of the Match Man of the Match: Sammy Ameobi had only been on the pitch for around eight seconds when he equalised and he was impressive for the rest of the second half too. Goal of the Match: Ameobi's superb equaliser - a shot rifled across Lloris from left to right after Colback's pass through - was his first in the Premier League. Moment of the Match: Midweek hero Harry Kane sent a ball across the face of goal late on but no Spurs player was able to turn it home. Talking Point: Could Newcastle jump above Tottenham in the table next weekend? The Magpies host an out-of-sorts Liverpool while Spurs go to Aston Villa. Pardew threw on Ameobi and Remy Cabella at the start of the second half. And within eight seconds of kick-off, Jack Colback sent the ball through for Ameobi to latch onto in the left channel and he finished brilliantly across Hugo Lloris. Then on 58 minutes, the Lane was stunned into silence as Perez - on his full Toon debut - rose to head in Cabella's cross to put the away side ahead. Despite late pressure from Spurs, the visitors held on to take all three points - a timely shot in the arm for under-fire Pardew, who built on their maiden win against Leicester with a first away victory for seven months. Taylor: Newcastle delivered Taylor: Newcastle delivered It had looked unlikely after Adebayor deservedly put Mauricio Pochettino's side ahead in the Bill Nicholson anniversary match, marking 10 years since Tottenham's great former player and manager passed away. But it was Newcastle, a club Nicholson represented as a guest during the Second World War, who ultimately secured victory. Spurs were dominant, if uninspiring, in the first half and they appealed for a spot-kick against Daryl Janmaat inside the opening two minutes. Pochettino: Spurs deserved more Pochettino: Spurs deserved more Jan Vertonghen, Eriksen and Ryan Mason all failed with long-range efforts, before Newcastle left-back Paul Dummett missed an audacious attempt of his own from 40 yards. Colback wasted a fine opportunity when the normally-reliable Lloris unconvincingly punched away a Moussa Sissoko cross, before a rare moment of class led to an 18th-minute breakthrough. Last-ditch blocks kept Chadli and Eriksen at bay, but Mason showed impressive ingenuity to clip in a cross for Adebayor to direct home. Erik Lamela: Battles for the ball with Fabricio Coloccini It was an impressive header which proved the only difference at half-time as Spurs failed to create any further shots on target. Danny Rose was unable to keep an effort down after an impressive Erik Lamela prod put him through, before the left-back saw a hopeful appeals for a spot-kick rightfully waved away. Chadli wastefully blazed over a volley at the end of an uninspiring first half in which Newcastle looked poor. Emmanuel Adebayor: Headed Tottenham in front Cabella and Ameobi were brought on in a bid to change things, but Pardew could not in his wildest dreams imagined their impact. Five touches and around eight seconds was all it took for Newcastle to pull themselves level, with Eric Dier caught napping from a fine Colback pass which substitute Ameobi rifled home. Pochettino and many of the Spurs substitutes were not even back at their seats when the goal was breached - a shock to the system Spurs could have recovered almost immediately had Fabricio Coloccini not impressively denied Eriksen turning home a squared ball from Rose. Ameobi: Mobbed by team-mates after equaliser That block saw Newcastle remarkably turn the match on its head. Despite having looked to receive a pass from Sissoko in an offside position, second-half introduction Cabella sent in a cross which full debutant Perez headed home. The visitors' relief was clear by the wild celebrations which would have been repeated had Cabella ended a solo run by squeezing his effort inside the near post rather into the side-netting. Pardew: Joy for Newcastle manager It was a let-off the home faithful thought they had capitalised on in the 66th minute when Eriksen caught out Tim Krul directly from a corner, but the Newcastle goalkeeper's blushes were saved by linesman indicating the cross had gone out of play before curling back in. Harry Kane, fresh from coming on, could not beat Krul with his first attempt of the afternoon as Spurs upped the ante, with Aaron Lennon failing to hit the target. A low, driven cross from Kane somehow evaded his team-mates and Roberto Soldado had an effort blocked as a leveller proves beyond them."},{"date": "26/10/2015", "arena": "Old Trafford", "attendance": 75327, "home_team": {"name": "Manchester United", "lineup": [{"name": "David De Gea", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rafael", "yellows": [12], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Smalling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marcos Rojo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Luke Shaw", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daley Blind", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ángel di María", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Juan Mata", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [67]}, {"name": "Marouane Fellaini", "yellows": [77], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adnan Januzaj", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robin van Persie", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Anders Lindegaard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Carrick", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ander Herrera", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Darren Fletcher", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tyler Blackett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andreas Pereira", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Wilson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [67], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Chelsea", "lineup": [{"name": "Thibaut Courtois", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Branislav Ivanovic", "yellows": [65], "reds": [90], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gary Cahill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Terry", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Filipe Luis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cesc Fàbregas", "yellows": [50], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nemanja Matic", "yellows": [39], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willian", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Oscar", "yellows": [62], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [67]}, {"name": "Eden Hazard", "yellows": [88], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Didier Drogba", "yellows": [22], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Petr Cech", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kurt Zouma", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathan Aké", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Mikel Obi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [67], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "André Schürrle", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mohamed Salah", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lewis Baker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "A last-gasp equaliser from Robin van Persie gave Manchester United a dramatic 1-1 draw against Chelsea at Old Trafford. Man Utd v Chelsea Sign in to watch highlights Didier Drogba rolled back the years to hand the Blues the lead with a trademark near-post header - his first Premier League goal since March 2012. Jose Mourinho looked set for victory in the battle against Louis van Gaal, but deep into injury time Branislav Ivanovic was sent off for fouling Angel di Maria and Van Persie swept home from the resulting free-kick for a share of the spoils. The Super Sunday panel believe Manchester United's performance against Chelsea was a vast improvement and shows that the club are turning a corner The Super Sunday panel believe Manchester United's performance against Chelsea was a vast improvement and shows that the club are turning a corner Mourinho, who was clearly unhappy at referee Phil Dowd for giving Ivanovic a second yellow card for the foul, left Old Trafford with his unbeaten record in tact and his team 10 points ahead of United at the top of the Premier League. But that will be of little consolation to the Chelsea boss who will feel his team should have won this match. Many had questioned whether, at 36 years old, Drogba could fill the huge gap left by the absent Diego Costa, but he had no trouble heading home Cesc Fabregas' corner in the 53rd minute. Best of the Match: Man of the match: Thibaut Courtois - The Chelsea goalkeeper produced an outstanding performance between the sticks. Goal of the match: Didier Drogba - The big Ivorian towered about Rafael at the near post to powerfully head home the opening goal. Moment of the match: Robin Van Persie - The Dutchman was on the spot to slam home a dramatic equaliser deep in stoppage time. Stats of the match: Drogba scored his first Premier League goal since March 2012 (v Stoke City). Van Persie has now scored seven Premier League goals against Chelsea, but this is the first away from Stamford Bridge. Talking point: Chelsea were missing Diego Costa and Loic Remy so will Jose Mourinho be happy with a point? Can Louis van Gaal's side build on this result with Manchester City next up? It was vintage Drogba, peeling off his marker to glance Fabregas' corner past keeper David de Gea. But the striker's job was made so much easier by the fact that 5ft 7in defender Rafael was the man marking him. United did not look like getting back into the match with Van Persie and Juan Mata wasting good chances to level for the hosts. Chelsea looked perfectly organised at the back, but it was left for Van Persie to snatch a point for his boss deep into added time. The match started with Chelsea, well aware of United's defensive frailties, winning two corners in the opening five minutes. Oscar gained space in the box after an error by Marcos Rojo, but his deflected shot flew wide as United scrambled back to prevent an early goal. Mixed feelings for Van Persie Mixed feelings for Van Persie Eden Hazard slipped by the ponderous Rafael and the Brazilian was shown a yellow card for tugging the Belgian's shirt. The hosts hit back and broke through Di Maria, who worked the ball to the back post where Marouane Fellaini lurked but the midfielder, making his first start of the season, could not finish. Mata then found Di Maria free in the box, but he volleyed over. The pace of the match then decreased somewhat. Chelsea were happy to allow United plenty of time on the ball and wait for opportunities to break. That idea backfired though as United created chance after chance. Performance pleases Van Gaal Performance pleases Van Gaal Januzaj, playing ahead of the injured Radamel Falcao, sliced open the Chelsea back four with a peach of a pass, but Thibaut Courtois rushed off his line to deny Van Persie, who wasted another chance moments later by heading straight at the Chelsea goalkeeper. Chelsea, a far more physically imposing side than United, used their muscle to break up the hosts' attacks. Nemanja Matic body-checked Di Maria and Drogba went into the book for tripping Juan Mata. Chelsea only found a sight of goal when United made mistakes. Rojo and Blind lost possession near the half way line, but neither Willian nor Drogba could capitalise. Rojo lost possession again, but luckily for the Argentinian De Gea was on hand to deny Drogba with his feet. Mourinho praises Chelsea display Mourinho praises Chelsea display Mourinho, meanwhile, remonstrated with fourth official Chris Foy after Chelsea were not given a penalty as Ivanovic tumbled to the ground after grappling with Chris Smalling in the box. Januzaj went close with a fierce drive but Mata's shot was not so hot. He fired well over the bar from 15 yards just before half-time. All that good work was undone within eight minutes of the restart. De Gea saved brilliantly from Hazard but the Spaniard was picking the ball out of the net moments later when Drogba glanced the ball in from Fabregas' corner. Chelsea were piling on the pressure and Ivanovic brushed off the challenge of Fellaini and Rojo before firing inches wide from a tight angle. There looked to be no way back for United, but Dowd showed Ivanovic a second yellow for a foul on Di Maria in the corner in the final minute of added time. The Argentinian found Fellaini with his cross but Courtois saved. The ball dropped at the feet of Van Persie, who drove home from close range to send Old Trafford into ecstasy."},{"date": "25/10/2015", "arena": "Upton Park", "attendance": 34977, "home_team": {"name": "West Ham United", "lineup": [{"name": "Adrián", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Carl Jenkinson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Collins", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Winston Reid", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Cresswell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex Song", "yellows": [47], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mark Noble", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Morgan Amalfitano", "yellows": [7], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [67]}, {"name": "Stewart Downing", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Diafra Sakho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [89]}, {"name": "Enner Valencia", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [76]}], "subs": [{"name": "Kevin Nolan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [89], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cheikhou Kouyaté", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [67], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ricardo Vaz Te", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joey O'Brien", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jussi Jaaskelainen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Diego Poyet", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Carlton Cole", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [76], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Manchester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Joe Hart", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pablo Zabaleta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Vincent Kompany", "yellows": [44], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eliaquim Mangala", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gael Clichy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [78]}, {"name": "Jesus Navas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yaya Touré", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fernando", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [78]}, {"name": "David Silva", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Edin Dzeko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [59]}, {"name": "Sergio Agüero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Bacary Sagna", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Milner", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [78], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aleksandar Kolarov", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [78], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willy Caballero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fernandinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martín Demichelis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stevan Jovetic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [59], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Diafra Sakho: Celebrates netting once against for the Hammers West Ham put a severe dent in Manchester City's title aspirations after earning a deserved 2-1 win at Upton Park.

Talking Points: How much damage does this result do to City? Can West Ham keep this form up? The result sees West Ham stay fourth, while City will be hoping for a favour from bitter rivals Manchester United on Sunday to ensure they don’t fall too far behind leaders Chelsea in their title defence. City had plenty of early possession, but it was the visitors who looked more threatening from the word go. Sakho heads second at Upton Park A West Ham free-kick almost led to the opening goal. James Collins lumped it forward and Sakho flicked it onto Valencia, but Hart saved from close range. The goalkeeper was clattered by Valencia and looked to be in trouble, but he managed to shake it off and carry on. Valencia was causing City all sorts of problems with his pace and power, and the Ecuadorian was key to earning the Hammers the lead. Latching onto a fantastic throughball from Alex Song, Valencia drove at Clichy, got to the byline, and pulled the ball across goal, just evading the outstretched leg of Pablo Zabaleta, and straight into the path of Amalfitano, who couldn’t miss from one yard out. Yaya Toure and Stewart Downing tussle The hosts were certainly buoyed by their goal, and they almost doubled their lead just a few minutes later, but Stewart Downing headed over when he really should have hit the target after arriving late in the box. Valencia was in the thick of the action again as the home side continued to dominate. The lively forward got on the end of an Aaron Cresswell cutback, but he scuffed his shot just wide. City rarely threatened, but almost got an undeserved equaliser late in the opening period, but Adrian was alert to use his feet to clear from under Sergio Aguero’s nose as the Argentinian striker tried to control a low, fizzing cross. The second-half began as the first ended - with the home side in the ascendancy. Downing wasted a glorious chance to extend the lead early in the half, after being picked out by some audacious skill from Song, but the former Liverpool midfielder dragged his effort wide on the volley. Joe Hart and Vincent Kompany clash Aguero almost levelled just before the hour mark after being played in by David Silva, but City’s talisman was denied by the feet of Adrian, and a wonderful James Collins block on the rebound. Then the Argentinian hitman had the best chance of the match, and a man of his ability should really have equalised. After being picked out, in space, three yards out, Aguero somehow contrived to hit the underside of the crossbar, with the rebound falling to Yaya Toure, but Adrian was equal to it, making an acrobatic block, even keeping hold of the ball. City enjoyed a period of dominance following that chance, but they couldn’t find a way through a resolute Hammers rear guard. Toure was then guilty of missing another great chance to get back on level terms, but his curling effort from the edge of the box clipped the top of the crossbar. Morgan Amalfitano opens the scoring The hosts made City pay for missing those opportunities just minutes later, with Sakho once again getting on the scoresheet. A wonderful left-wing cross from the impressive Cresswell picked out the in-form Senegalese hitman, who headed towards the bottom corner, which Joe Hart reached to try to keep out, but the goal decision system revealed it had crossed the line. City got back into it almost immediately, however, thanks to a wonderful individual goal from David Silva. The Spanish midfielder jinked his way through several tackles, and curled a sublime effort past Adrian to give the visitors hope. It ensured the final 10 minutes were nervy for the Upton Park faithful, but some last ditch defending kept the champions at bay, and ensured the Hammers’ impressive start to the season

League goal goes on Liverpool failed to score at home for the second straight game as they were held to a 0-0 draw by Hull City in a lacklustre game at Anfield. The Reds bossed possession in the match but were unable to convert that into many meaningful scoring opportunities as their struggles following the departure of Luis Suarez and absence of Daniel Sturridge continued. Moments of the match Man of the match: Philippe Coutinho might only have been on the pitch for half-an-hour, but the Brazilian put in an excellent display and Liverpool will be left wondering how they didn't win that. Moment of the match: Eldin Jakupovic coming up with a massive save for his side right at the death, denying Mario Balotelli from close range. Attempt of the match: Philippe Coutinho doing extremely well to keep hold of the ball on the edge of the box, before unleashing a fierce shot on goal, only to be denied by Eldin Jakupovic . Save of the match: Eldin Jakupovic getting his finger tips to the ball to tip Philippe Coutinho's fierce shot from distance over the cross bar. After Liverpool’s comprehensive 3-0 defeat by Real Madrid on Wednesday, this result will do little to improve the mood of Brendan Rodgers, who watched under-fire striker Mario Balotelli struggle once again. The game’s first chance came in the tenth minute when Dejan Lovren rose highest to head Steven Gerrard’s corner goalwards but Ahmed Elmohamady cleared off the line with Tigers goalkeeper Eldin Jakupovic well beaten. Liverpool threatened again soon after when Raheem Sterling’s clever through ball put Mario Balotelli in behind but the Italian’s shot was turned aside by Jakupovic. The home side had a penalty appeal waved away when James Chester appeared to hack Adam Lallana down after the England midfielder had crossed the ball but referee Neil Swarbrick was unmoved. Hull boss Steve Bruce said his players were terrific against Liverpool Hull boss Steve Bruce said his players were terrific against Liverpool Jake Livermore had the chance to put the visitors ahead on 42 minutes after Hatem Ben Arfa cut the ball back from the by-line but the former Tottenham man’s shot from 12 yards was straight at Simon Mignolet. The Tigers threatened again just before the break when Tom Huddlestone’s fizzing left-footed half-volley from outside the box was deflected just past Mignolet’s post by Martin Skrtel. Steven Gerrard came close to breaking the deadlock on the hour mark when he hit Sterling’s clever lay-off first time but his curling half-volley flashed just wide. Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers said he was proud of the effort from his players Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers said he was proud of the effort from his players Balotelli almost scored soon after when he hurled himself at Lovren’s flick-on from a Gerrard corner but Hull scrambled the ball clear and Sterling’s follow-up shot was off target. Lovren missed a good chance for the home side on 73 minutes when Balotelli squared the ball to him but he swung and missed the ball with his left foot from six yards out. Substitute Phillipe Coutinho had a chance to snatch three points for Liverpool but he was unable to keep his header from Gerrard’s free kick down after Jakupovic got the faintest of touches. The Anfield faithful had a loud appeal for a penalty shortly afterwards after Balotelli appeared to be bundled over by Alex Bruce in the box but Swarbrick waved it off. Gerrard was denied by a last-ditch tackle from Chester and Jakupovic did well to tip a rasping Coutinho effort over in injury-time but Hull held on to claim a point despite a frantic final push from Liverpool, which included Balotelli missing from three yards with just about the final kick. Matt Le Tissier’s verdict Matt Le Tissier said Liverpool look a different team to the one they were last year Matt Le Tissier said Liverpool look a different team to the one they were last year Mario Balotelli isn’t going to do himself any favours. It wasn’t a performance that says ‘keep me in the team next week’. He had a real good chance in the last couple of seconds and the goalkeeper made a good save, but on first viewing it looked as though it was going to be a goal all day long and perhaps should have been. He also went down for a penalty when his first touch let him down and there was minimal contact. It wasn’t a penalty for me. For the whole afternoon, he didn’t really look like somebody who was trying to prove a point after what happened in the week. He looked a little bit casual about things. Liverpool did not create loads. There were probably only three or four attempts on target in the whole game. Hull defended pretty well. Last week they hung in for a long time against Arsenal and they did the exact same thing. It was a very solid defensive display by them."},{"date": "25/10/2015", "arena": " Mary's Stadium", "attendance": 30017, "home_team": {"name": "Southampton", "lineup": [{"name": "Fraser Forster", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathaniel Clyne", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "José Fonte", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Toby Alderweireld", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Bertrand", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Davis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Morgan Schneiderlin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Cork", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [62]}, {"name": "Dusan Tadic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Graziano Pellè", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sadio Mané", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Kelvin Davis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Maya Yoshida", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Florin Gardos", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shane Long", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Wanyama", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [62], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Emmanuel Mayuka", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harrison Reed", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Stoke City", "lineup": [{"name": "Asmir Begovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Bardsley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Shawcross", "yellows": [39], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marc Wilson", "yellows": [81], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Erik Pieters", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven N'Zonzi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charlie Adam", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [53]}, {"name": "Jon Walters", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [69]}, {"name": "Geoff Cameron", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Moses", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [79]}, {"name": "Peter Crouch", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Robert Huth", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marko Arnautovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [69], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mame Biram Diouf", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [53], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steve Sidwell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Oussama Assaidi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [79], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bojan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Thomas Sorensen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Sadio Mane: Celebrates his first goal for Southampton Southampton continued their impressive start to the season after earning a comfortable 1-0 win over Stoke City at St Mary’s Stadium. Despite the scoreline suggesting there wasn’t much between these sides, the Potters never really caused Saints goalkeeper Fraser Forster any problems all afternoon. Sadio Mane, who had a goal chalked off last week and given as an own goal, notched his first official Saints goal in the first half to give his side a deserved lead. Best of the Match Man of the Match: Sadio Mane. A real livewire all afternoon. Attempt of the Match: Sadio Mane: The Senegalese winger curled just wide early on. Save of the Match: Asmir Begovic. Got down low smartly to tip Dusan Tadic effort wide. Talking Points: Are Saints a flash in the pan? Champions League qualification? Can Stoke get dragged into a relegation battle? Morgan Schneiderlin could have broken the deadlock before Mane's strike, but the Frenchman saw his close-range effort thunder against the crossbar. Stoke made several changes in the second half, which gave them more impetus, but they rarely threatened Forster’s goal. Ronald Koeman’s men held on for their sixth win of the season to remarkably move up to second in the table. Stoke drop to 12th after the defeat. Koeman: We were fantastic Koeman: We were fantastic Mane was the only change to the side that faced Sunderland and made a lively start, with Pelle just unable to turn home his cross-shot at the far post. Steven Davis also had an effort as Saints looked to make an early breakthrough, but it was far from one-way traffic and Fraser Forster was relieved to see a sloppy clearance deflect wide off Steven Nzonzi. Former Southampton striker Peter Crouch directed the Frenchman's cross over as the visitors continued to press, with Victor Moses showing good skill to wriggle past several defenders before being crowded out. At the other end, Saints winger Mane was causing havoc and giving Phil Bardsley a torrid time. Graziano Pelle could only direct into the side-netting when the Senegal international beat the right-back to the byline, although he made amends by denying Mane a goalscoring opportunity after the Italy international shot wide under pressure. Fonte proud of clean sheets Fonte proud of clean sheets Tadic's fine pass set up that chance on what was proving another impressive display for Saints, which he would have capped with another goal was it not for a fine, low save by Asmir Begovic. The Serbian, fresh from providing a record-equalling four assists last week, then laid off for Schneiderlin, who rattled the crossbar from the edge of the box as Saints looked for an opener which arrived in the 33rd minute. Pelle saw an impressive swivelled shot come back off the post, but Mane did brilliantly to fire home the rebound off the underside of the bar Try as they might, Saints were unable to find a second before half-time, from which they returned strongly as Pelle again hit the woodwork with a powerful header from a Tadic cross. Hughes frustrated by first half Hughes frustrated by first half Mark Hughes brought on Mame Biram Diouf for Charlie Adam in a bid to alter the dimension of the game and, while it forced Saints into more mistakes, they were struggling to create clear-cut chances. The hosts, too, were also now struggling to break down their opponents, although were still managing to get the odd shot away. Playmaker Tadic shook off a back complaint to swivel in the box and roll an effort wide in the 66th minute, before turning provider with a corner which Pelle could only direct across the face of goal. It was another wasted opportunity, leaving the hosts susceptible to a late Stoke comeback. Diouf's introduction had given City more of an attacking threat and, after having penalty appeals waved away, he came close to latching onto a raking Bardsley cross. It was a let-off Saints were thankful for. Defending in numbers during the closing stages, they breathed a deep sigh of relief when substitute Marko Arnautovic struck wide in stoppage time as they held out for another win. Charlie Nicholas’ verdict Nicholas praises solid Saints Nicholas praises solid Saints Southampton played well and I thought they deserved to win the match. In the first 25 minutes or so it was a fairly well-balanced game and Stoke were playing pretty well without being overly creative. When Southampton went in front it was a really quick finish and we didn’t really get much of a response from Stoke. They didn’t get quick service to Crouch and he didn’t have midfield runners. If Cameron and N’Zonzi are going to be holders then they’ve got to say to Charlie Adam to get further forward. Charlie Adam hardly got a kick and he was subbed.

Best of the match Man of the match: Alexis Sanchez. In a game in which few players rose above the ordinary, Sanchez’s killer instincts saw him grab a deadly double. Goal of the match: Wes Brown may have made a horrendous error to send him clear on goal, but Sanchez showed great composure to clip the ball over Vito Mannone. Moment of the match: Sunderland were well in the game and holding their own until Brown gifted Arsenal an opportunity to break the deadlock. Talking point: How can Sunderland stop the costly errors? Have Arsenal got enough to secure a top-four finish? Brown, one of their seasoned performers, got himself in a horrible mess on the half-hour mark. With the ball caught under his feet, he tried to bundle back to Mannone but only succeeded in presenting Sanchez with a clear run on goal – with the talented Chilean keeping his composure to casually dink over the advancing Sunderland goalkeeper. Arsenal were once again far from their best but wrapped up the points in the dying seconds when Mannone took a heavy touch inside his own box and Sanchez gratefully accepted the gift to rattle into an empty net. Humiliation The home side's humiliation on the south cost last weekend had cast long shadows and head coach Poyet sent his team out demanding a reaction, although that was always going to be easier said than done against an Arsenal team packed with talent, although depleted by injury and suspension. However, the Uruguayan could only look on helplessly as his players initially struggled to shake off the trauma of their Southampton nightmare. The Gunners, predictably, retained possession with ease as Mikel Arteta and Mathieu Flamini supplied the excellent Sanchez, Santi Cazorla and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain ahead of them to repeatedly stretch the home defence. By contrast, the Black Cats at times treated the ball as if it were a live hand-grenade as they retreated ever deeper towards Mannone. Danny Welbeck: Helped Arsenal to three points against former loan employers However, for all their early dominance, the visitors struggled to create clear openings with former Sunderland loanee Danny Welbeck sending a swerving, dipping 15th-minute effort on to the roof of the net after Sanchez had fired wide from distance. Outlet Poyet's men only rarely managed to venture into enemy territory with the left flank their only real outlet, and while winger Will Buckley tested defender Calum Chambers on several occasions, it was full-back Patrick van Aanholt who forced an important 25th-minute block from Per Mertesacker after running on to Sebastian Larsson's pass. But it was Mertesacker's clearance which indirectly led to the opening goal. Oxlade-Chamberlain: we deserved win Oxlade-Chamberlain: we deserved win Brown looked to have the ball under control just inside his own half and turned neatly away from Sanchez in order to play it back to Mannone. However, his disastrous miskick allowed the Chilean to run through on goal and delicately chip the onrushing keeper. Cazorla and Arteta both went close as the Gunners looked to kill the game off before half-time, although the home side managed to escape further damage. Whatever Poyet said during the break appeared to have an effect as his players returned in far more determined mood and set up camp much higher up the pitch. Productive Poyet laments mistakes Poyet laments mistakes He was forced into a 50th-minute reshuffle when lone striker Steven Fletcher limped off to be replaced by Connor Wickham, and the newcomer arrived with his team enjoying their most productive period of the game to that point with midfielder Jack Rodwell forcing a save from Wojciech Szczesny with a firm header two minutes later. For the first time in the game, the Arsenal rearguard found itself under concerted pressure, although the home side's frailty at the back invited further pressure with Brown almost serving possession up to Chambers before Van Aanholt's aimless clearance allowed Sanchez to test Mannone from distance. Larsson warmed Szczesny's hands with a 65th-minute drive from 25 yards and substitute Jozy Altidore looped a header towards goal from Van Aanholt's inviting cross with 14 minutes remaining. Wenger pleased with win Wenger pleased with win However, the United States international fluffed his lines two minutes later when, having been picked out with a raking long pass by fellow substitute Jordi Gomez, he scuffed a volley harmlessly across the penalty area. Szczesny very nearly handed Van Aanholt on 81st-minute opportunity to level when, fearing he was about to step outside his area, he headed the ball straight to the full-back wide on the left, although the Dutchman's long-range effort sailed wide of the far post with Mertesacker racing back to cover for his keeper. But disaster struck at the death when Mannone failed to control Buckley's back-pass and Sanchez added a second from close range. Phil Thompson’s verdict Thompson unimpressed by Arsenal Thompson unimpressed by Arsenal It was two horrendous mistakes and for all the possession Arsenal had in the game, certainly in the first half, they have got to be having more attempts on target. This was an extremely nervous Sunderland side and for all the possession Arsenal had they should have won this more comfortably. The goals were absolutely shocking. When they analyse them on Sunday morning they will see them and think ‘why?’ Wes Brown had plenty of time on the ball and yet he let Sanchez, who was Arsenal’s best player, get away. The second one was in injury time and they just had to clear their lines. Mannone couldn’t sort his feet out and hit it straight to Sanchez. Two mistakes cost them."},{"date": "25/10/2015", "arena": "The Hawthorns", "attendance": 24738, "home_team": {"name": "West Bromwich Albion", "lineup": [{"name": "Ben Foster", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andre Wisdom", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Craig Dawson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joleon Lescott", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sébastien Pocognoli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Morrison", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Craig Gardner", "yellows": [82], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Graham Dorrans", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [83]}, {"name": "Stéphane Sessegnon", "yellows": [45], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Chris Brunt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Saido Berahino", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Brown Ideye", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Anichebe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Boaz Myhill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cristian Gamboa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Youssouf Mulumbu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gareth McAuley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sebastian Blanco", "yellows": [88], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [83], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Crystal Palace", "lineup": [{"name": "Julian Speroni", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [55]}, {"name": "Martin Kelly", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adrian Mariappa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Brede Hangeland", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joel Ward", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wilfried Zaha", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [64]}, {"name": "Mile Jedinak", "yellows": [66], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Ledley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yannick Bolasie", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marouane Chamakh", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [73]}, {"name": "Fraizer Campbell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Adlene Guedioura", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [73], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin Doyle", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wayne Hennessey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [55], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dwight Gayle", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Zeki Fryers", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Barry Bannan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jason Puncheon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [64], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Saido Berahino: Grabbed late equaliser against Crystal Palace Saido Berahino continued his impressive form to snatch West Brom a stoppage time equaliser from the penalty spot against Crystal Palace. Berahino’s last-gasp strike completed a second-half fight back initiated by Victor Anichebe six minutes after his half-time introduction. Palace had led 2-0 after Brede Hangeland’s opener and Mile Jedinak’s penalty. Moments of the match Man of the match: Yannick Bolasie. The Palace winger's counter-attacking ability kept his team in it. Moment of the match: Victor Anichebe goes down for the last-gasp penalty and West Brom sense an equaliser. Goal of the match: Saido Berahino kept his cool in a pressurised situation to score his injury-time penalty. Talking point: Were Ben Foster and Julian Speroni fouled in the build-up to goals? Palace will have felt that, before Mark Clattenburg gave either penalty, they should have had a spot-kick when Wilfried Zaha was upended in the 37th minute but nevertheless the visitors looked comfortable at the break. The opening goal had the home crowd – and their keeper – feeling hard done by as Ben Foster claimed for a foul when he failed to deal with a Palace corner. With the West Brom keeper struggling, Hangeland bundled the ball home. It could have been two when Zaha was tripped by Craig Dawson in the box but the Manchester United loanee honestly popped straight back to his feet without appealing. Palace continued to threaten with the speed of Zaha and Yannick Bolasie on the counter-attack - West Brom's Sebastien Pocognoli was particularly struggling with their directness. At one stage he caught Zaha late twice within a minute but the worst was yet to come from the Belgian. In first-half injury time Pocognoli rashly fouled Bolasie and Jedinak scored from the spot. Irvine: We deserved a point Irvine: We deserved a point The introduction of Anichebe at the break in place of the ineffective Stephane Sessegnon livened West Brom up and he pulled a goal back within six minutes. Palace keeper Julian Speroni was clattered at a corner allowing Anichebe to head home. The Argentine stopper had looked uncomfortable with incoming crosses but on this occasion took an elbow in the face from Craig Dawson as they contested the high ball, leaving an unguarded net in front of Anichebe. The goal mirrored Hangeland's opener when Foster complained that the referee had failed his protect him sufficiently. Speroni remained floored for a number of minutes but after he gathered his senses, Palace's substitute keeper Wayne Hennessey was ready to come on. Speroni visibly protested his withdrawal in a bizarre scenario but Palace did haul him off - he was later spotted with an ice pack on his head. Warnock disappointed by referee Warnock disappointed by referee Palace began to defend deeper and deeper as West Brom cranked up the pressure - at one stage Foster was able to keep the ball at his feet 10 yards from the half-way line without a challenge. The six minutes of stoppage time caused by the treatment to Speroni gave the Baggies time to draw level. Anichebe skilfully turned in the box and Jedinak hauled him down. Berahino, the highest scoring Englishman in the Premier League this season, netted his seventh of the campaign from 12 yards to earn West Brom their share of the spoils. Paul Merson’s verdict Merson: Draw the fair result Merson: Draw the fair result These were two teams who had a right go. West Brom probably looked at this game and thought they could win it and Palace probably thought the same. Fair play to both teams because they went for it. Dawson came steaming in from a long way out for the first West Brom goal, but Speroni was falling backwards with bodies around him. Not for the life of me could he mean it. If he meant it then it should be a 25-game ban because he ran a distance. No way. It was accidental, a pure accident. It was touch and go if the ref gave the goal and I thought it was the right decision because Anichebe was in front of the goalie when he fell backwards. For me they were good decisions by the ref all round."},{"date": "25/10/2015", "arena": "The Liberty Stadium", "attendance": 20259, "home_team": {"name": "Swansea City", "lineup": [{"name": "Lukasz Fabianski", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Angel Rangel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Federico Fernandez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Williams", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Neil Taylor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sung-Yueng Ki", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonjo Shelvey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wayne Routledge", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [83]}, {"name": "Gylfi Sigurdsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [58]}, {"name": "Jefferson Montero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wilfried Bony", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [83]}], "subs": [{"name": "Marvin Emnes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathan Dyer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [83], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Carroll", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [58], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bafétimbi Gomis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [83], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gerhard Tremmel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Bartley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Liam Shephard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Leicester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Kasper Schmeichel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ritchie de Laet", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wes Morgan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Liam Moore", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paul Konchesky", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dean Hammond", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [68]}, {"name": "Danny Drinkwater", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [68]}, {"name": "Riyad Mahrez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Nugent", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jamie Vardy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [67]}, {"name": "Leonardo Ulloa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Matthew James", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [67], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andy King", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [68], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jeffrey Schlupp", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Esteban Cambiasso", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [68], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marcin Wasilewski", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Smith", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Wood", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Two goals from Wilfried Bony helped Swansea City seal their first win in six Premier League games thanks to a well-deserved 2-0 victory against Leicester City at the Liberty Stadium.

David Jones, Jamie Redknapp and Leon Britton look at the blossoming relationship between Swansea duo Wilfried Bony and Gylfi Sigurdsson David Jones, Jamie Redknapp and Leon Britton look at the blossoming relationship between Swansea duo Wilfried Bony and Gylfi Sigurdsson The Ivorian scored for the third successive game to hand the home side a deserved lead 11 minutes before the break following a flowing move. Angel Rangel fired his pass into the path of Bony who back-flicked the ball around the corner for Gylfi Sigurdsson. The Icelandic star then reversed his pass back to Bony who thumped his crisp shot past Kasper Schmeichel in a flash. They doubled their lead just before the hour mark with another well-worked move. Jefferson Montero played a give and go with Sigurdsson before laying his low ball across the box for that man Bony to seal all three points and help the Welsh side climb into sixth position. Bony managed 16 goals in his first season in English football but endured a slow start this time around following a summer where he played for Ivory Coast at the World Cup and had to put up with constant speculation over his future. Best of the Match: Man of the match: Wilfried Bony - His brilliant brace helped Swansea end their losing streak with a well-deserved win. Goal of the match: Bony's first goal – He cleverly back-flicked the ball around the corner for Gylfi Sigurdsson. The Icelandic star then reversed his pass back to Bony who thumped his crisp shot past Kasper Schmeichel in an instant. Shot of the match: Jonjo Shelvey turned and hammered a stunning right-foot piledriver off the woodwork with Kasper Schmeichel clutching at thin air. Miss of the match: Esteban Cambiasso - The substitute managed to hit the post from a yard out with the goal at his mercy. Stat of the match: Bony has now scored 20 Premier League goals for Swansea; the joint-most with Michu. The Foxes are now without a win in four top flight games and drop down to 16th spot. Poor marking from a corner allowed Bony an early sight of goal but the striker headed wide and then his 18-yard shot from Sigurdsson's square pass was comfortably held by Schmeichel in the Leicester goal. Schmeichel was not so composed when Wes Morgan played a back-pass into his path and the goalkeeper scuffed his clearance. Sigurdsson seemed sure to open the scoring but Morgan recovered well in time and just made contact with the ball to spare Schmeichel's blushes. Leicester were lifeless as a first-half attacking force - their best move ending with a Riyad Mahrez cross floating harmlessly wide beyond the far post - and they fell behind after being cut open in the 34th minute. Reaction from two-goal man of the match Wilfried Bony and Gylfi Sigurdsson after Swansea's 2-0 win over Leicester Reaction from two-goal man of the match Wilfried Bony and Gylfi Sigurdsson after Swansea's 2-0 win over Leicester Angel Rangel's pass found Bony and his delicious flick freed Sigurdsson, the Icelandic international shaping to shoot but instead cutting the ball back to Bony who finished with aplomb from 20 yards. The goal was further evidence of the growing understanding between the pair, Bony on target again after hitting his straps in the last month and Sigurdsson's seventh assist of an extremely productive campaign. Leicester needed to show some intent and they struck the crossbar within two minutes of the restart in bizarre circumstances when Liam Moore hurled his throw deep into the Swansea box. Jonjo Shelvey swung a leg at it but it was unclear whether the midfielder made any contact with it or the ball simply spun off the turf to hit the top of the Swansea crossbar. Still, Leicester were buoyed by that moment and Mahrez soon broke forward to deliver the Foxes' first shot, which sailed harmlessly over, before Danny Drinkwater forced Lukasz Fabianski to hold onto his 25-yard drive. Garry Monk was pleased with his Swansea side's display in the first half of their 2-0 win over Leicester Garry Monk was pleased with his Swansea side's display in the first half of their 2-0 win over Leicester But the wind was taken right out of Leicester sails in the 57th minute when Jefferson Montero and Sigurdsson interchanged cleverly for the winger to breach the Foxes' back-line, draw Schmeichel, and leave Bony with a straightforward finish. The impressive Sigurdsson limped off straight away to be replaced by Tom Carroll but Shelvey almost put the issue beyond doubt when his 30-yard shot whistled past Schmeichel and clattered off the Leicester bar. Mahrez had been Leicester's best player by some distance, certainly from an offensive standpoint, and his 20-yarder flew close to Fabianski's far post with the goalkeeper struggling to get across his line. Leicester should have grabbed a consolation in stoppage-time when Fabianski pushed out Andy King's header and Esteban Cambiasso put the rebound against the post when it seemed easier to score, the miss from two yards out summing up the Foxes' misery."},{"date": "20/10/2015", "arena": "The Hawthorns", "attendance": 25794, "home_team": {"name": "West Bromwich Albion", "lineup": [{"name": "Boaz

"Manchester United's Daley Blind celebrates his equaliser, which earned a point for the visitors Daley Blind struck a late leveller as Manchester United's stuttering Premier League form continued with a 2-2 draw against West Bromwich Albion at The Hawthorns. Van Gaal: 'Best performance so far' Van Gaal: 'Best performance so far' United twice fought back from a goal down, with substitute Marouane Fellaini cancelling out Stephane Sessegnon's early opener with his first goal for the club, while Blind fired in an 87th minute equaliser after Saido Berahino had restored the lead for West Brom. Louis van Gaal had insisted beforehand he was pleased with the progress after steering United within touching distance of the top four, but they remain 10 points adrift of leaders Chelsea, while Alan Irvine’s side edged further from the bottom three. Best of the Match Man of the Match: Craig Dawson had an excellent game at centre-back and made 17 clearances. Goal of the Game: All four were great strikes but Marouane Fellaini's was the pick of the bunch. Mistake of the Match: Rafael was guilty of a lapse in concentration to allow West Brom to regain the lead at 2-1 as he dropped too deep. Talking Point: United have still not won an away game this season. Are they showing their hosts too much respect? There had been little goalmouth incident in a frantic opening until Andre Wisdom left Angel di Maria in his wake in the eighth minute. The defender set off on a driving run from his own half, with no interruption, and his low cross was met with a superb first-time finish from Sessegnon which flew into the top corner. Suddenly United’s defensive frailty, so evident in their opening games, was there for all to see and James Morrison lashed over following more jittery work from the backline. Di Maria has provided plenty of attacking artistry since his move from Real Madrid, but for once he unleashed an ugly, scuffed effort that failed to trouble Boaz Myhill. The energetic Wisdom then cut out a dangerous cross from Robin van Persie as United gave another glimpse of their threat, but Juan Mata made a mess of a promising free-kick, ballooning the ball over. Just before the break, United’s night nearly worsened when Joleon Lescott nodded over and a concerned Van Gaal appeared to issue orders to Fellaini as both teams trooped off. Fellaini, one of the few remnants from the short David Moyes reign, came to the aid of his successor after only two minutes of the second half. Di Maria sent over a swirling cross to the tall midfielder and he shrugged of the attentions of Lescott, turned swiftly and drove a rising shot past Myhill. United’s skittish players had been injected with fresh belief and Mata’s goal-bound shot was blocked as they searched for more. Fellaini happy with first goal Fellaini happy with first goal But Berahino revived the hosts with a ruthless finish. Chris Brunt slid the ball through a gaping hole in the United defence and the striker raced into space and calmly placed the ball past David de Gea. There was more dismay amidst the United ranks as they appealed in vain for a penalty after Sebastien Pocognoli handled and Van Persie then hit the post with a dipping effort from outside the area. But Blind kept his composure late on, guiding a low shot into the bottom corner after Lescott had only partially cleared a cross from Rafael."},{"date": "19/10/2015", "arena": "Kiyan Prince Foundation

all three points following a remarkable finish to a meeting with Queens Park Rangers which ended 3-2. Two own goals, the first from Richard Dunne and the second from Steven Caulker in the 95th minute, left the hosts cursing their luck and rooted to the foot of the Premier League table. Best of the match Man of the match: Philippe Coutinho. Had QPR got something out of the game, Bobby Zamora led the line superbly. But the introduction of Coutinho as a second-half substitute sparked Liverpool into life and he scored one and created another in an extraordinary finish to an extraordinary game. Goal of the match: Coutinho produced a superb finish to curl a low shot into the far corner of the QPR net, via the aid of a slight deflection off the unfortunate Steven Caulker that left Alex McCarthy with no chance. Moment of the match: Coutinho’s introduction ultimately changed the game as before his arrival Liverpool had been poor. He injected some much-needed positivity and creativity into a side who will need to improve dramatically ahead of next week’s Champions League clash with Real Madrid. Talking point: How did QPR not get something out of this game? They could have been four goals ahead at the break with Leroy Fer twice hitting the bar and Charlie Austin wasting two glorious chances. They then showed real character to equalise twice before being hit by a late sucker punch in added time. Eduardo Vargas had stepped off the bench to give Harry Redknapp’s men hope late on, as he netted either side of a Philippe Coutinho effort, but it was to be Brendan Rodgers celebrating at the final whistle. He will be a relieved man to be heading home with the points after seeing his side put in a disjointed display in the capital. Bobby Zamora was a thorn in Liverpool’s side from the off, with the powerful frontman crossing for Leroy Fer to crack the ball off the top of the crossbar just before the half-hour mark. The Dutchman hit the woodwork again shortly afterwards as he nodded over Simon Mignolet and Glen Johnson had to scramble clear from in front of Charlie Austin and Sandro as the visitors rode their luck. It appeared destined that the game would end goalless as QPR continued to toil at the start of the second half and Mario Balotelli lifted a volley over a gaping net after Alex McCarthy had parried an effort from Adam Lallana. A moment of misfortune on 67 minutes brought the contest to life, though, with Johnson latching onto a quickly-taken free-kick to fire across the face of goal and force a disorientated Dunne to poke over his own line. That was how things stayed until three minutes from time when Austin cushioned a cross fed to the back post into the path of Vargas to volley in from close range. The tie was suddenly swinging from end to end, with Coutinho finishing off a flowing counter-attack with a low drive that flicked off Caulker before Vargas once again restored parity with a glancing header from a corner which beat Mignolet at his near post before he could claw clear. Richard Dunne: Put through own net to break the deadlock Liverpool were not to be denied, though, and as Raheem Sterling raced through, his square pass intended for Balotelli was bundled into an unguarded net by the back-tracking Caulker. Fatigue All eyes were on Sterling, in the starting line-up against his old club, after a week in which he had been an almost permanent fixture on the back pages following England manager Roy Hodgson's revelation that the player had complained of tiredness prior to the qualifier away to Estonia. Once the game began, there were certainly no signs of fatigue from QPR. Eduardo Vargas: Bagged a brace but it would not be enough Redknapp has had to fend off suggestions that Les Ferdinand's arrival as head of football operations puts his Loftus Road status in jeopardy, but this rousing performance points to potential improvements ahead. Rangers owner Tony Fernandes will be chief among those crossing fingers the club can claim their just rewards in future. QPR bossed the first half, stretching Liverpool time and again, pulling out all the stops bar a goal. The hosts outplayed, out-thought and outmanoeuvred lacklustre Liverpool, who had serious problems with Emre Can's link work with Dejan Lovren and Martin Skrtel. Steven Caulker: Watches on helplessly as his own goal settles the contest By contrast Sandro dominated proceedings in front of Rangers' back line, allowing the likes of Fer to raid effectively off lynchpin Zamora. Former West Ham striker Zamora was the clear man of the first half, causing untold problems for Can dropping deep to offer the ideal pivot for Rangers' attacking blueprint. Fer should have scored twice in the half, so despite all the promise the hosts will have been frustrated to turn around without a comfortable lead. Bundled Brendan Rodgers admits QPR did not deserve to lose the match against Liverpool, after the visitors scored a late winner to take all three points. Brendan Rodgers admits QPR did not deserve to lose the match against Liverpool, after the visitors scored a late winner to take all three points. Austin bundled his way clean through only to bungle his finish, even flicking the rebound wide from Mignolet's parried save. Liverpool's malaise consistently emboldened Rangers, who again should have taken the lead when Zamora drifted into the inside-right berth. After driving deep into the Liverpool box, Zamora dragged back the perfect ball for the onrushing Fer - only for the Dutchman to blast against the crossbar despite plenty of time and space to pick his spot. Neither side learned their lesson from the incident, Liverpool allowing Zamora to produce another telling right-wing cross only minutes later. Harry Redknapp says he was very pleased with QPR's performance in the 3-2 loss to Liverpool but says they were naive with their defending. Harry Redknapp says he was very pleased with QPR's performance in the 3-2 loss to Liverpool but says they were naive with their defending. This time Fer beat Mignolet to the centre and headed goalwards, but again his finish was mere paintwork away from breaking the deadlock. Liverpool finally conjured a serious opening as the half dwindled to a close, Balotelli's slide-rule pass inviting Steven Gerrard to tiptoe around Caulker. The former England skipper's curling shot was always heading wide however, leaving both sides frustrated at the break, though for vastly differing reasons. So nearly the home hero, Vargas ought to have cherished getting off the scoring mark in style, but was left to bemoan a strange quirk of fate. After Dunne put through his own net, all bedlam broke loose, and in the event the hosts were cruelly and unjustly denied."},{"date": "19/10/2015", "arena": "Bet365 Stadium", "attendance": 27017, "home_team": {"name": "Stoke City", "lineup": [{"name": "Asmir Begovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Bardsley", "yellows": [45], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Shawcross", "yellows": [33], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marc Wilson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Erik Pieters", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven N'Zonzi", "yellows": [89], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charlie Adam", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mame Biram Diouf", "yellows": [35], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [62]}, {"name": "Stephen Ireland", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [62]}, {"name": "Victor Moses", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [73]}, {"name": "Peter Crouch", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Marc Muniesa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jon Walters", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [62], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Geoff Cameron", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [62], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steve Sidwell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Oussama Assaidi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [73], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bojan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Thomas Sorensen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Swansea City", "lineup": [{"name": "Lukasz Fabianski", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Angel Rangel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Federico Fernandez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Williams", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Neil Taylor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sung-Yueng Ki", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Carroll", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [65]}, {"name": "Nathan Dyer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [65]}, {"name": "Gylfi Sigurdsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [85]}, {"name": "Wayne Routledge", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wilfried Bony", "yellows": [75], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Marvin Emnes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [85], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bafétimbi Gomis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [65], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jefferson Montero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [65], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gerhard Tremmel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Bartley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Liam Shephard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jay Fulton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Jon Walters came off the bench to head Stoke City to a 2-1 win after coming from behind against Swansea City at the Britannia Stadium.

He failed to make contact and appealed for a penalty, claiming his shirt had been held by Neil Taylor, but - on this occasion - nothing was given. Gary Monk feels Stoke's penalty against Swansea was a disgrace and feels a need for consistency in refereeing Gary Monk feels Stoke's penalty against Swansea was a disgrace and feels a need for consistency in refereeing Around 10 minutes later, though, Oliver was convinced there had been an infringement when Shawcross and Bony got to grips with each other as a corner came into the Stoke box and the latter went to ground. The Potters skipper was booked, the penalty was given and Bony stepped up to calmly convert it, sending Begovic the wrong way. But referee Oliver's pointed to the spot once more less than ten minutes later when Stoke had been pressing once more, and Moses burst into the box from the left flank. He subsequently hit the deck as Rangel came in to challenge him and although it seemed the on-loan Chelsea winger might have gone down a little easily, Oliver saw it as a foul. Adam made no mistake with the spot-kick. The home side looked eager to add another as the second half got under way, with Phil Bardsley lashing a wild effort off target and Adam shooting over from outside the box. Mark Hughes responds to Gary Monk over claims that Victor Moses cheated the referee in gaining a penalty in Stoke’s victory over Swansea Mark Hughes responds to Gary Monk over claims that Victor Moses cheated the referee in gaining a penalty in Stoke’s victory over Swansea Moses then sent a corner bouncing across the face of goal and Crouch met it with his head at the back post but could not keep his effort down. Soon after, a scramble in the Stoke area from a Swansea free-kick saw the ball come to Ki in front of goal, but Begovic dealt with his shot. Bony then, somewhat optimistically, went down in the box again as Marc Wilson marked him at a corner, with Oliver unmoved. It appeared anyone's game to win and it was the Potters who seized the moment with just under a quarter of an hour to go. Rangel gave the ball away, Stoke surged forward and Assaidi - on for Moses - crossed well to Walters, who directed a fine header past Fabianski. Swansea pushed for a leveller at the end, but efforts from Ki, Bony and substitute Bafetimbi Gomis were unsuccessful as the Potters held on for a valuable three points."},{"date": "18/10/2015",

Aguero netted four times in a contest which produced four penalties, with Manchester City beating 10-man Tottenham Hotspur 4-1. The Argentine striker proved to be the difference in an action-packed encounter at the Etihad Stadium, despite failing with one of his three attempts from 12 yards, with Christian Eriksen offering a solitary reply for a Spurs side that saw Premier League debutant Federico Fazio dismissed. Best of the match Man of the match: Sergio Aguero. Who else could it be? The Argentine was unplayable at times and could even afford to miss one of his three spot-kicks. Goal of the match: Aguero’s opener set the tone, with his thunderbolt of a strike after cutting inside on his right foot flashing past Hugo Lloris before he had time to react. Save of the match: Joe Hart did really well to spring low to his right to parry Roberto Soldado’s second-half penalty to safety. Moment of the match: Had Soldado scored, Tottenham would have been level. The game went away from them at that point. Talking point: Are defending champions City moving through the gears? Can Tottenham force their way into the top four? A game dominated by forward-thinking talent, with defences struggling at both ends of the field, was brought to life on 13 minutes when Erik Lamela was robbed of possession on the edge of his own box and Aguero was teed up to rocket a low drive beyond Hugo Lloris. Tottenham’s response to falling behind was impressive, with Eriksen drawing them level inside two minutes as Fernando was caught on the ball and the Dane drilled home via the leg of Joe Hart and the underside of the crossbar. There was to be no letting up, with Aguero restoring City’s lead from the spot 20 minutes in after Lamela was adjudged to have sent Frank Lampard tumbling inside the box. The former England midfielder was then stretchered from the field before a clumsy lunge from Younes Kaboul on David Silva presented Aguero with another opportunity from 12 yards out – one he spurned as he fired down the middle and Lloris saved with his legs. The breathless pace of the game continued after the interval, with both sides going close before another contentious penalty call offered Spurs hope just past the hour mark. Martin Demichelis clipped Soldado’s ankles as the Spanish striker wriggled away from him, but a debate as to whether contact was made inside or outside the area was ended by Hart as he sprung to his right to beat the ball to safety. Remarkably, referee Jon Moss then pointed to the spot for a fourth time on 68 minutes, with Fazio shown a straight red card for a tug on Aguero, freeing the South American to complete his hat-trick. Christian Eriksen: Briefly restored parity Spurs – who conceded 11 times in two meetings with City last season – were left with a containing job on their hands, but were breached again with 15 minutes remaining as Aguero beat the offside trap to cut inside onto his left foot and curl low into the bottom corner. Thrashed Spurs were thrashed 6-0 and were a goal down within a minute on the same ground 11 months ago. They performed much better this time but the end result was that the champions still had too much for them. They started well with Ryan Mason dragging a shot wide and then being denied when clean through by Hart. The England goalkeeper was in action again moments later as he tipped over an Eriksen drive. City looked much better in attack than defence and Silva almost put Aguero through before Jesus Navas tested Lloris. Lampard, starting ahead of the presumably rested Yaya Toure, then robbed Lamela to set up the first goal, although Aguero still had plenty to do. Sergio Aguero: Missed one spot-kick, but converted two The Argentinian actually seemed to have few options on the left of the area but he opened his body and clipped a superb shot inside the far post. Spurs produced an immediate response as Mason robbed Fernando and Soldado released Eriksen to smash a powerful shot in, off Hart and then off the underside of the crossbar. But the visitors could not retain parity for long as Lampard exchanged passes with Milner and then went down under a challenge from Lamela in the area. Moss had little hesitation in awarding the penalty and Aguero stepped up to fire home his second. City looked impressive in possession but their rhythm might have been disrupted when the influential Lampard appeared to suffer a thigh injury and had to be carried off just before the half-hour. Frank Lampard: Picked up an injury Yet the hosts pressed on and Aguero might have had his hat-trick - when he shot straight at Lloris - even before being presented with a second spot-kick as Kaboul felled Silva. Reprieve Lloris saved well from Aguero and the striker put the rebound over with a scissors kick. Spurs looked to make the most of the reprieve but Hart produced another fine save to keep out a Mason drive and also palmed away a long-range Eriksen effort. A frantic first half ended with Lloris saving from Navas and the second began with the same man stopping an Aguero shot. Navas was also frustrated in front of goal before Aguero failed to connect with a Silva cross by inches. There was another dramatic twist just after the hour as Demichelis was adjudged to have brought down Soldado. Federico Fazio: Saw red on Premier League debut But the third penalty awarded became the second one saved as Hart plucked Soldado's shot out of the bottom corner with a full-stretch dive. The England keeper had to be alert again moments later as Soldado connected firmly with a cross and he saved with his feet. City weathered that storm but it took another moment of controversy for them to gain firm control. This time Spurs league debutant Fazio was deemed to be in the wrong, pulling back his countryman Aguero off the ball and in front of goal to earn a red card. This time Aguero made no mistake from the spot and he was still far from done, scoring a fourth as he chased down a long ball from Fernandinho and curled in another fine shot. Spurs were already beaten as Toure came on for the final 14 minutes as Milner almost added to their woes with a curling shot that struck the post."},{"date": "18/10/2015", "arena": "Emirates Stadium",

equaliser as injury-hit Arsenal fought back to draw 2-2 with Hull City in their Premier League clash at the Emirates. The Gunners, with a makeshift defence and missing Mesut Ozil because of a knee injury, took an early lead through Alexis Sanchez. However, Hull hit back with a controversial equaliser from Mohamed Diame, as Arsenal claimed a foul in the build-up, and then took the lead at the start of the second half through Abel Hernandez, who had only been playing after an injury to Nikica Jelavic in the warm-up. Arsenal, who lost Jack Wilshere to what could prove to be another ankle problem, pressed to get back into the match, but looked to have been frustrated until Welbeck slotted home in the first of six minutes of added time. Steve Bruce was delighted with his side's performance against Arsenal but says conceding a late goal is a real shame. Steve Bruce was delighted with his side's performance against Arsenal but says conceding a late goal is a real shame. They then almost snatched the three points at the death through Kieran Gibbs, who was denied by stand-in Hull goalkeeper Eldin Jakupovic. The Gunners made a bright start as Welbeck collected a ball up to the edge of the Hull penalty area and held off James Chester before rifling in an angled drive, which Steve Harper beat away and then was quick to block the follow-up from Sanchez. Even better was to come from the Hull goalkeeper, though, as Harper acrobatically tipped over a curling 20-yard effort from Santi Cazorla at full stretch with one hand. Best of the match Man of the match: Alexis Sanchez's relentless closing down from the front coupled with an excellent goal and an assist for Webeck's equaliser earns him the makes him man of the match. Moment of the match: Abel Hernandez's header just seconds into the second-half sent shockwaves around the Emirates ans ultimately earned the visitors a point. Attempt of the match: Santi Cazorla's excellent curling effort from the edge of the area in the first-half that was well saved by departed goalkeeper Steve Harper. Save of the match: Eldin Jakupovic's late scrambling save to deny an onrushing Kieran Gibbs in second-half injury time. Talking point: Michael Dawson's obvious time-wasting on two occasions late in the second-half that were overlooked both times by referee Roger East. Goal of the match: Alex Sanchez's superb strike to open the scoring after leaving his marker Curtis Davies for dead down the right. However, he could do little to prevent Arsenal sweeping into the lead on 13 minutes with a finish of the highest quality from Sanchez. The Chile forward collected the ball on the right, and darted into the Hull penalty area before cutting back inside to drill a low shot across the goalkeeper into the far corner. After Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's shot was blocked by Curtis Davies as the Arsenal players appealed for handball, Hull were level on 17 minutes when Diame picked the ball up some 25 yards out and barged past Monreal. Arsene Wenger was pleased with his side's determination to snatch a late equaliser against Hull, but admits it's still a disappointing result. Arsene Wenger was pleased with his side's determination to snatch a late equaliser against Hull, but admits it's still a disappointing result. Mathieu Flamini then looked to have been pulled back by the midfielder, but referee Roger East allowed play to continue, with Diame clipping the ball over Wojciech Szczesny - much to the dismay of the Arsenal players and bench. Arsenal looked to regain the initiative, having been in complete control before the controversial equaliser. Hull dropped plenty of men behind the ball and proved difficult to break down in the final third. There was a delay just before half-time when Harper needed treatment after collecting a pass-back and looked to have injured his shoulder or neck.

Danny Welbeck speaks after scoring a last minute equaliser to secure a 2-2 draw with Hull. Tom Huddlestone got clear on the right and floated a ball into the Arsenal penalty area, where Hernandez easily got in front of Per Mertesacker to power a header past Szczesny. Once again Hull sat back, inviting Arsenal pressure, but the hosts continued to lack any spark in the final third. With 26 minutes left, Hernandez was replaced by Gaston Ramirez, while Arsenal sent on Aaron Ramsey, out for several weeks with a hamstring injury. Wilshere then hobbled off after looking to have jarred his ankle in a tackle with Ramirez, which earned him a yellow card. Costa Rica forward Joel Campbell came on. Hull defender Michael Dawson went down in a heap at an Arsenal corner, but was able to continue only to then be forced off after blocking a goal-bound effort from Sanchez, who then saw a looping header tipped over by Jakupovic. Just after the fourth official showed six minutes of added time, the Chilean skipped to the edge of the Hull area before slipping in Welbeck, who guided the ball into the far corner to equalise. Arsenal poured forwards in search of a dramatic winner, with Jakupovic spilling a low shot from Cazorla and then blocked Gibb's late run at the far post as Hull held out. Matt Le Tissier’s verdict “Hull did come close, but in the cold light of day Steve Bruce would probably accept that a point was a decent return for him. They were hanging on and hanging on and once they were 2-1 up they didn’t show any will to get forward again. They all sat back and invited Arsenal onto them – and Arsenal are so good, at the Emirates, at nicking late goals to save matches and that’s exactly what they did today. In the end, I think Steve Bruce will accept a point. “It sounds silly when they’ve let in two goals, but Arsenal’s new-look defence didn’t have much to do. Hull just didn’t attack that much to test them out, really. There’s no way in the world the first Hull goal should have stood.

Two goals just after the break from their new look front two, Diafra Sakho and Enner Valencia, were added to by substitute Carlton Cole - all with headers. Best of the Match: Man of the match: Stewart Downing - The winger is showing his best form for a long time and produced another superb performance at Turf Moor. Goal of the match: Enner Valencia - Carl Jenkinson's beautiful cross was powerfully headed into the back of the net by Ecuador's World Cup star. Moment of the match: Diafra Sakho became only the second West Ham player to score in five consecutive Premier League games, after Carlton Cole, with a fine header. Effort of the match: George Boyd chested the ball down and arrowed his left-foot half-volley flush against the woodwork. Sub of the match: Carlton Cole - Within minutes of coming on the striker headed in the Hammers third to hand them three points. Stat of the match: West Ham are the first team to score three headed goals in a Premier League game since Norwich vs Newcastle in December 2011. The hosts pulled a goal back through George Boyd with his first goal for the club to put the game back in the balance, but in the end the Hammers were good value for their win. Allardyce, once the manager of Burnley's bitter rivals Blackburn, is staying in the north-west to celebrate, and will do so in good spirits after the victory lifted them, at least temporarily, into the top four in the Premier League, while Sean Dyche's side are still searching for a first win back in the top flight. Burnley came close in the fifth minute, Boyd controlling Kieran Trippier's deflected cross and firing a brilliant left-footed volley against the underside of the bar. Lukas Jutkiewicz did have the ball in the net three minutes later but the former Middlesbrough man was denied a first Burnley goal, correctly, by an offside flag. Danny Ings had created the opening with a jinking run into the box and shot that was fumbled by Adrian into Jutkiewicz's path. It was a frustrating 10 minutes for Jutkiewicz, who then headed Trippier's cross over the bar before being unable to capitalise after two West Ham defenders fell over in the area. The Hammers had not got going, and Allardyce was unimpressed with Sakho, who appeared more concerned by an impending challenge from Jason Shackell than Aaron's Cresswell's fine cross and headed well wide from close range. The classy presence of Boyd in midfield had caught the eye and more trickery from him on the half-hour mark created another opening for Burnley. Michael Kightly looked poised for a free header from Boyd's cross at the far post but Jutkiewicz took the ball away from his team-mate, leaving Kightly with head in hands. There was a narrow escape for the hosts down the other end as Stewart Downing cut inside on the right of the area and curled a shot against the far post. Burnley manager Sean Dyche says his team created plenty of quality chances against West Ham but failed to convert them. Burnley manager Sean Dyche says his team created plenty of quality chances against West Ham but failed to convert them. Dyche would have been encouraged by his side's first-half display but frustrated they could not make the most of their superior chances. And they were made to pay four minutes into the second half when Cresswell curled over a superb cross and Sakho, this time with his eyes firmly on the target, headed in. Five minutes later it was 2-0, Carl Jenkinson the architect from the right this time and Valencia applying the finishing touch with a fine header from 10 yards. It was very nearly three as Cole - on for Valencia - got his head to a corner only to see it cleared off the line by Kightly, and from there Burnley went down the other end and pulled one back. On the eve of his 60th birthday, West Ham handed Sam Allardyce the perfect present thanks to a 3-1 success at Burnley. On the eve of his 60th birthday, West Ham handed Sam Allardyce the perfect present thanks to a 3-1 success at Burnley. Ings won a corner and then made a nuisance of himself as Adrian tried to collect the cross, allowing Boyd to slam the ball home. Adrian appealed for a free-kick but the blame appeared to lie squarely with him. It was the boost Burnley needed and they almost drew level immediately but Ings' header from Trippier's cross flew agonisingly wide of the far post. However, West Ham did a good job of seizing back the momentum and quietening the crowd and, with 20 minutes to go, they restored their two-goal advantage. It was another cross that undid Burnley, Noble's corner picking out Sakho, who headed across the six-yard box for Cole to nod in. Downing almost added a fourth with a rasping shot that flew just wide, while Cresswell poked a shot straight at Heaton. Burnley's afternoon was rather summed up three minutes from time when the excellent Trippier crossed for substitute Ashley Barnes to slam a shot against the bar."},{"date": "18/10/2015", "arena":

Premier League lead after coming through an explosive encounter with Crystal Palace to earn a 2-1 win. Both sides had a man sent off in the first half with Chelsea’s Cesar Azpilicueta receiving a straight red for a studs-up challenge on Mile Jedinak but the numbers were evened up moments later when Damien Delaney was shown a second yellow for a pull back on Loic Remy. BEST OF THE MATCH Man of the match - Nemanja Matic. Controlled the tempo of the contest throughout and prompted much of Chelsea's best play Goal of the match: Cesc Fabregas' strike was sublime with Jose Mourinho already calling it Chelsea's goal of the season Miss of the match: Frazier Campbell did get his goal in the end but could easily have had a hat-trick had he taken first half openings Talking point: There were two sendings off but could Fabregas and Campbell have also seen red rather than yellow? It could easily have been nine-a-side at the break with Frazier Campbell and Cesc Fabregas involved in an ugly tangle as Azpilicueta headed for the tunnel but referee Craig Pawson – who had never shown a Premier League red card before today – opted only to caution the pair. In John Terry’s 500th game as Chelsea skipper, it was Oscar who put the Blues en route to victory after just six minutes with a wonderful curling free kick which flew beyond Julian Speroni’s despairing right hand and into the top corner. A magnificent second goal from Fabregas soon after the break gave the visitors breathing space. The Spaniard exchanged passes with Eden Hazard and Oscar before bursting into the area and sliding the ball beyond Speroni for his first Premier League goal in Chelsea colours. But Chelsea did not have things their own way – especially in the first half - with Palace making life tough for the league leaders who were missing leading scorer Diego Costa. And they set up a nervy finish for the leaders when Campbell netted from close range after good work from substitute Wilfried Zaha. Campbell could easily have scored before Oscar’s opener but was denied first by Thibaut Courtois and then Azpilicueta. He had another chance moments after the Brazilian’s free-kick but could only put his lob onto the roof of Courtois’ net following a mistake by Gary Cahill. After Oscar’s wonderful set-piece, Palace were right in the game as Neil Warnock’s side harried Chelsea all over the pitch. And with the visitors reduced to ten men on 40 minutes following Azpilicueta’s lunge on Jedinak, they could have made life difficult for the leaders before a rush of blood from Delaney evened up the numbers. Cesc Fabregas gives his thoughts on Chelsea's 2-1 win over Crystal Palace. Cesc Fabregas gives his thoughts on Chelsea's 2-1 win over Crystal Palace. The Republic of Ireland international conceded the free-kick which saw Oscar give Chelsea the lead and was cautioned on half-an-hour for pulling back Remy as the Frenchman turned him. A repeat offence on 43 minutes saw Delaney dismissed, much to the disgust of Warnock who must have thought he had a great chance of getting back on terms. Fabregas’ goal within six minutes of the restart took much of the heat out of the contest with Nemanja Matic controlling things in midfield as Hazard and Oscar threatened to cut the Palace defence open on numerous occasions. The Brazilian had a great chance to add to his tally on 68 minutes but opted to try his luck first time rather than take a touch and his tame effort was easily gathered by Speroni. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho says his team had their Premier League game against Crystal Palace under control from the first minute to the last. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho says his team had their Premier League game against Crystal Palace under control from the first minute to the last. Hazard too could have got on the scoresheet but his curling effort from just inside the box went just beyond the far post. Jedinak tried to get Palace back into the game with a long-range effort on 55 minutes but his shot was straight down the throat of Courtois. Warnock threw on Zaha and Adlene Guedioura in an attempt to get back into the game with James MacArthur and Jason Puncheon making way but the Blues always remained in control.

Crystal Palace manager Neil Warnock was unhappy with the referee's performance as his side were beaten by Chelsea at Selhurst Park. They had a scare ten minutes from time but Cahill was on hand to make a superbly-timed challenge inside the Chelsea area to deny Yannick Bolasie as he bore down on Courtois’ goal. Their persistence was rewarded right on 90 minutes when Campbell scored a deserved goal but the Blues - who threw on Didier Drogba for the closing moments - were able to see the game out. Paul Merson’s verdict \"I thought the ref had an absolute blinding game with the red cards. I don’t know what he did wrong. They came out in the second half as 10 v 10 and there’s only one winner. Chelsea were keeping the ball for 40 passes at a time, patiently. Fabregas scored a phenomenal goal and he is somebody who is a phenomenal footballer. It was a good game, but Chelsea just shaded it. \"Palace played very well and if they carry on playing like that they will win games – but don’t blame the referee.\""},{"date": "18/10/2015", "arena":

home Premier League win of the season as they beat Aston Villa 3-0 to offer a glimpse of improvements to come from Roberto Martinez's side. A knee injury on the eve of the season had sidelined the England international until now, but thrown straight into the action he put in a 65-minute shift against Villa which provided a reminder of just what the Toffees had been missing. When captain Phil Jagielka opened the scoring with his second in three Premier League matches there was a sense it was going to be Everton's day, and a much-needed goal for Romelu Lukaku, who benefited from a mistake by Brad Guzan, and Seamus Coleman also on the scoresheet on his recall after a month out injured provided the confirmation. Everton manager Roberto Martinez was delighted with the way his team played against Aston Villa, calling it a 'clever' performance. Everton manager Roberto Martinez was delighted with the way his team played against Aston Villa, calling it a 'clever' performance. The return of Coleman, rated the best right-back in the country by his Republic of Ireland manager Martin O'Neill, should not be underestimated, but the fact Everton produced their sharpest passing display of the season on Barkley's first appearance of the campaign was surely no coincidence. He showed the nine-week lay-off had not dulled any of his verve as he added an injection of pace and quick-thinking in the space between Villa's defence and midfield, which presented the visitors with a number of questions. They struggled for an answer as Barkley, the continually excellent Steven Naismith and Leon Osman combined with full-backs Leighton Baines and Coleman to stretch play as Everton probed for gaps in their opponents' back line. What they needed was a fully-functioning striker to take advantage but £28million record signing Lukaku is still well short of his best, with manager Martinez blaming the after-effects of the World Cup. His Belgium team-mate in the opposing ranks, Christian Benteke, had a more legitimate excuse - on his first start since rupturing an Achilles tendon in March - for not troubling centre-back Antolin Alcaraz, who was preferred to Sylvain Distin, left out of the squad despite Martinez insisting he is fit again after a dead leg. Paul Lambert admits his Aston Villa side did not deserve to get anything out of the 3-0 defeat to Everton. Paul Lambert admits his Aston Villa side did not deserve to get anything out of the 3-0 defeat to Everton. As is usually the case Barkley took centre-stage early on, volleying over a rebound from Osman's shot, drilling a free-kick into the wall after he had drawn the foul and then casually side-stepping Ashley Westwood and forcing Guzan to tip over. That ultimately led to the opening goal as from the second corner in succession the ball came back to Baines, who delivered a perfect cross with his weaker right foot for Jagielka to convert a stooping header. After six goals in his previous 210 league appearances, the centre-back now has two in his last three after scoring a brilliant late equaliser in the Merseyside derby last month. The loss of centre-back Nathan Baker to injury did not help Villa's cause and Alan Hutton's curling effort just wide of Tim Howard's right-hand post was the closest they came to troubling the Everton goalkeeper in the first half. Barkley's poise and vision then saw him pick out Coleman, who cut inside to force Guzan to palm away his left-footed shot, but the Villa goalkeeper should have done much better three minutes after half-time. The instigator again was Barkley as he rolled a pass inside for Lukaku to collect, and while his left-footed shot was on target it was hardly the most ferocious but Guzan allowed it to squirm under his arm. Phil Jagielka opened the scoring in Everton's comfortable 3-0 victory over a Aston Villa with a diving header. Phil Jagielka opened the scoring in Everton's comfortable 3-0 victory over a Aston Villa with a diving header. That touch of fortune may be exactly what Lukaku needs to boost his confidence levels and compensate for what is missing from his physical game. He certainly looked rejuvenated for the remainder of the half as he showed a greater determination to chase lost causes and hold up the ball more. Benteke may take a while to regain his match fitness but he showed no lack of sharpness to volley home after his initial shot had rebounded off the crossbar, but unfortunately for him his push on Alcaraz had already been spotted by referee Anthony Taylor. Villa will hope they are up to speed sooner rather than later after a fourth successive Premier League defeat without scoring a single goal, something they have not ``achieved'' since January 2001. Coleman completed their misery when he converted Baines' cross after Osman's quickly-taken free-kick 13 minutes from time. Charlie Nicholas’ verdict “Everton will feel better. I thought Aston Villa didn’t play that badly, but it was littered by mistakes. After the first goal, I thought Villa were excellent, but didn’t create a great amount. Christian Benteke was a little rusty and needs more sharpness in front of goal and they made a terrible start to the second half when they gave a goal away. It was a very comfortable day for Everton, but I didn’t think Villa did a lot wrong. “Ross Barkley did well. I thought overall his passing was good, but he needs matches.”"},{"date": "18/10/2015", "arena": "St James' Park, Newcastle", "attendance": 51886, "home_team": {"name": "Newcastle United", "lineup":

Newcastle finally secured a much-needed first victory of the season after edging past Leicester 1-0 at St James' Park. Kick-off was delayed by an hour amidst farcical scenes at St James’. With fans kept in the dark outside the ground, engineers struggled to fix a new big screen which had come loose in the wind. For safety reasons, the turnstiles were not opened until 3:15pm, with kick-off put back to 4pm. Best of the Match Man of the Match: Papiss Cisse. Worked tirelessly with little support. Save of the Match: Tim Krul. Dutch stopper smothered Drinkwater strike superbly. Miss of the Match: Papiss Cisse. Why did he choose power over precision? Talking Points: Can Newcastle kick on from here? Were they fortunate to earn three points? Have Leicester peaked too soon? The match itself lacked any real quality, with chances few and far between. Fabricio Coloccini and Papiss Cisse both missed glaring opportunities for the hosts, while Matty James should have done better from a good position. We looked to be heading for stalemate in the north east until Gabriel Obertan intervened, firing an unstoppable shot past Kasper Schmeichel in the Leicester goal as St James' breathed a mass sigh of relief. The Frenchman's first Newcastle goal for two years was enough to secure the Magpies' first win of the season, and alleviate some of the pressure that has been mounting on boss Alan Pardew's shoulders. Despite the win, Pardew's men remain in the bottom three, but are just one point behind local rivals Sunderland in 17th. Leicester are in 13th. When we finally did get underway the action was as disorientated as the flailing engineers who worked to try to fix the faulty screen pre-match. Newcastle manager Alan Pardew says the club now need to build on their victory over Leicester and win more matches in the Premier League. Newcastle manager Alan Pardew says the club now need to build on their victory over Leicester and win more matches in the Premier League. Coloccini should have broken the deadlock after being picked out by Moussa Sissoko, but the defender side-footed wide from ten yards out with the goal gaping. Matty James was equally guilty of wasting a glorious opportunity. Leonardo Ulloa did brilliantly to hold off his man, created space and laid the ball through to James, unmarked, but he scuffed his shot straight at Tim Krul in the Magpies’ goal. The woodwork was rattled in bizarre fashion late in the opening period. Marc Albrighton floated in a free-kick from deep, which evaded everyone and cannoned back off the post with Krul beaten. The home side seemed to have been rejuvenated after the break and were much more of a threat going forward. Leicester manager Nigel Pearson says the team's finishing quality let them down against Newcastle. Leicester manager Nigel Pearson says the team's finishing quality let them down against Newcastle. Cisse really should have scored after capitalising on a poor backpass from Paul Konchesky, but after rounding Schmeichel, he elected to wildly lash the ball home, rather than roll it into the empty net, and missed the target. The breakthrough finally came after a swift counter attack, and caused an eruption of emotion on the St James’ terraces. Cisse picked up the ball on the half-way line, laid the ball off to Obertan, who ran at the Foxes’ defence, cut inside twice, and emphatically drove his strike into the bottom corner, leaving Schmeichel with no chance. Newcastle's Gabriel Obertan hopes the team's victory over Leicester can be a turning point for the club this season. Newcastle's Gabriel Obertan hopes the team's victory over Leicester can be a turning point for the club this season. The goal did spark the visitors into life, with Krul finally called into action. The Dutch stopper did brilliantly to smother a powerful Danny Drinkwater strike after the ball had fallen to the former Manchester United midfielder on the edge of the box. And at the last, substitute Anthony Knockaert worked space for an effort in the box, but an heroic block from Steven Taylor kept the visitors at bay and ensured the Toon Army left St James’, albeit later than they had planned, with a rare winning feeling."},{"date": "18/10/2015", "arena": " Mary's Stadium", "attendance": 29615, "home_team": {"name": "Southampton", "lineup": [{"name": "Fraser

Sunderland contributed to their own downfall with a comedy own goal from Santiago Vergini and another own goal from substitute Liam Bridcutt with further strikes from Graziano Pelle (2), Jack Cork, Dusan Tadic, Victor Wanyama and Sadio Mane completing the rout. Best of the match Man of the match: Dusan Tadic just gets the nod, but there were a lot of candidates in the Southampton side. Goal of the match: Graziano Pelle's first goal of the game came from a brilliant cross from Steven Davis. Shot of the match: Victor Wanyama came off the bench to smash home a shot high into the net past Mannone. Controversy of the match: Sunderland felt they should have had a penalty at 2-0 when Fletcher was upended by Fraser Forster, but their appeals were waved away in what could have been a turning point in the contest. oment of the match: Santiago Vergini scored one of the craziest own goals in Premier League history to gift Southampton the lead after a bright start from Sunderland. Talking point: What can Southampton achieve this season? Are Sunderland heading for another relegation fight this season? The defeat was the worst possible way to mark Gus Poyet's 50th game in charge of Sunderland, while Saints continued their impressive start to the campaign as Ronald Koeman celebrated his manager of the month award in style. Sunderland started the brighter of the two sides, but all their good work was undone after 12 minutes with one of the most bizarre own goals in Premier League history. There appeared very little danger when Vergini tried to clear the ball from Morgan Schneiderlin inside the box only for the Sunderland defender to inexplicably volley his clearance past his own keeper and into the bottom with a strike a forward would have been proud of. Things got worse for Sunderland six minutes later as Pelle celebrated his Player of the Month awatd with a tap in for his sixth goal of the season. Steven Davis, who signed a new deal at Southampton earlier this week, was the creator as his perfectly weighted ball across the six-yard box was slotted home by the in-form Pelle. Sunderland felt they should have been awarded a penalty on 35 minutes when Lee Cattermole played Steven Fletcher in on goal and he poked his effort on the stretch wide before being taken out by the onrushing Fraser Forster. The Sunderland players appealed for a penalty, but their claims were waved away by referee Andre Marriner. Two minutes later and Southampton took full advantage of the penalty escape as Dusan Tadick picked out Cork's run at the far post and he bundled the ball home despite Vito Mannone getting a hand on his shot. Gus Poyet says Sunderland's 8-0 thrashing at Southampton was his most embarrassing moment in football Gus Poyet says Sunderland's 8-0 thrashing at Southampton was his most embarrassing moment in football Southampton almost grabbed a fourth goal just past the hour mark when Long unselfishly passed for Tadic inside the box and he poked his shot goalwards only to see Patrick van Aanholt get back and clear the ball off the line. However, the home side did not have to wait long to make it 4-0 as Betrand got down the left and pulled the ball back for Pelle who saw his shot blocked by Mannone only for Bridcutt to get his feet in a tangle and bundle the ball over the line for another own goal. The impressive Pelle grabbed his second of the game on 69 minutes when Tadic slipped him in on goal with a fine pass and the striker superbly swept his first-time shot into the corner past Mannone. Ronald Koeman admits he is surprised by the result Ronald Koeman admits he is surprised by the result Sunderland gifted Southampton another goal on 78 minutes when Mannone's wretched clearance fell straight to the feet of Tadic 25 yards from goal and the Serbia curled his shot into the empty net. A minute later substitute Wanyama added a seventh goal as Tadic picked out the midfielder inside the box and he smashed a shot high into the past a demoralised Mannone. The home side continued to pour forward in search of more goals and they made it 8-0 four minutes from time with the impressive Tadic again the creator as he pulled the ball back for substitute Mane to slot home and leave the home fans in raptures. Phil Thompson's verdict Phil Thompson agrees with Gus Poyet after the Sunderland manager accused some of his players of giving up Phil Thompson agrees with Gus Poyet after the Sunderland manager accused some of his players of giving up \"This was shocking, absolutely shocking. It was a shambles. People were not taking responsibility. Cattermole in midfield couldn’t get near anybody today. He didn’t have a leader. Nobody would stand up for the cause. \"This was astonishing. Yes, we can talk about the problems for Sunderland but it was brilliant for Southampton. This was players playing with confidence. We talk about the so-called big teams having full-backs pushing on, but this is how to do it; Clyne was going down the right-hand side and Bertrand down the left at the right times. They were passing the ball and interchanging – they are absolutely flying. This is where this 8-0 result happens. You’ve got one team playing to the top of their ability and the other one who have just been calamitous.

Goal of the Match: Angel di Maria’s third goal in five United appearances was easy on the eye as he curled Juan Mata’s pass beyond Tim Howard and into the bottom corner. Angel di Maria’s third goal in five United appearances was easy on the eye as he curled Juan Mata’s pass beyond Tim Howard and into the bottom corner. Moment of the Match: Leighton Baines had never missed a Premier League penalty until De Gea thwarted him on the stroke of half-time after Luke Shaw had hacked down Tony Hibbert with Everton trailing 1-0. Everton did manage to get on level terms 10 minutes after the restart as Baines found Steven Naismith unmarked inside the six-yard box which a superb delivery to head beyond the helpless De Gea. But United found themselves back in front just seven minutes later as Di Maria’s strike from range fell kindly into the path of Falcao, who was able to guide it past Tim Howard for his first goal since arriving from Monaco this summer. De Gea then produced stunning late saves to deny substitutes Leon Osman and Bryan Oviedo as United were made to hold on for the three points. Van Gaal will face tougher tests after the international break - Everton were ravaged by injuries and clearly tired after a 4,000-mile trip to Krasnodar - but the United boss will be happy to have chalked up his third win, especially as it came without suspended captain Wayne Rooney. The only negative for the Dutchman was that Shaw hobbled off in the second half with an injury. United's play at the start had all the hallmarks of a typical Red Devils performance under former boss Sir Alex Ferguson. The hosts flew at Everton from the first whistle with some high-tempo play that was easy on the eye. Shaw found Falcao with a perfect delivery in the fourth minute, but the Colombian mis-timed his header, which flew wide. David de Gea tips Bryan Oviedo's strike over Di Maria then created a yard of space on the left wing and sent over another perfect cross, but Robin van Persie blazed over the bar. Falcao wasted a chance in front of goal soon after following a lovely move which included a majestic mid-air flick from Di Maria. Marcos Rojo frayed a few nerves with a couple of risky passes, but otherwise United looked strong at the back thanks to a solid display from 19-year-old Paddy McNair. After applying heavy pressure, United finally broke the deadlock in the 27th minute. Phil Jagielka attempted to hook Rafael's cross clear, but instead it landed at the feet of Mata, who squared to Di Maria and he tucked the ball beyond Tim Howard with a curling right-footed shot. Romelu Lukaku holds off Paddy McNair Di Maria would have added a second straight away had Howard not saved his deflected free-kick with a superb diving save. Romelu Lukaku, isolated up front for Everton, took down Baines' long pass on his chest but volleyed wide before Shaw put United's good first-half work in jeopardy by clumsily bringing Hibbert down in the box from behind. Friend pointed to the spot, but Baines saw his impeccable record vanish before his eyes as De Gea flung his right arm out to push the penalty wide. United continued to press after the restart, but they failed to add to their goal tally immediately. Angel di Maria celebrates with Juan Mata Falcao was the most guilty party. The on-loan Moncao hitman somehow failed to turn in Di Maria's flat ball into the box and he then shinned Shaw's cross wide from eight yards out. Everton then stunned the home crowd with an equaliser as Baines made up for his penalty miss by swinging a deep cross towards Naismith, who powered his header past De Gea after peeling off his marker Shaw. Everton sensed blood and looked for a second. They almost got it when Jagielka headed Aiden McGeady's cross goalwards, but Falcao cleared off the line. Falcao then finally found the net at the other end to put United ahead. The Colombian timed his run inside the box to perfection and prodded in Di Maria's mis-cued shot from close range. United then suffered a blow when Shaw hobbled off with an injury. Tyler Blackett came on in his place and Van Gaal also introduced James Wilson for Falcao, who received a standing ovation for his efforts. Osman broke through the United defence in the final minute, but once again De Gea rescued the hosts with a fine diving save. The Spaniard denied Oviedo with another acrobatic save and the match ended on a bad note for Everton when John Stones was carried off on a stretcher with an injury."},{"date": "05/10/2015", "arena": "Stamford Bridge", "attendance": 41607, "home_team": {"name": "Chelsea", "lineup": [{"name": "Thibaut Courtois", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [24]}, {"name": "Branislav Ivanovic", "yellows": [53], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gary Cahill", "yellows": [20], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Terry", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "César Azpilicueta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nemanja Matic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cesc Fàbregas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "André Schürrle", "yellows": [66], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [69]}, {"name": "Oscar", "yellows": [86], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [87]}, {"name": "Eden Hazard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Diego Costa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Petr Cech", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [24], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Filipe Luis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kurt Zouma", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Mikel Obi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [69], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mohamed Salah", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Loïc Remy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willian", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [87], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Arsenal", "lineup": [{"name": "Wojciech Szczesny", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Calum Chambers", "yellows": [22], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Per Mertesacker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Laurent Koscielny", "yellows": [27], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kieran Gibbs", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mathieu Flamini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mesut Özil", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Wilshere", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [83]}, {"name": "Santi Cazorla", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [69]}, {"name": "Alexis Sánchez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [79]}, {"name": "Danny Welbeck", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Tomas Rosicky", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [83], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lukas Podolski", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [79], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [69], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nacho Monreal", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Emiliano Martinez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joel Campbell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Francis Coquelin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Chelsea moved five points clear at the top of the Premier League table with a hard-fought 2-0 win over London rivals Arsenal at Stamford Bridge. The influential Eden Hazard set Chelsea on their way when he won and converted a penalty in the first half. Diego Costa made the game safe with a second goal 12 minutes from time after being set up by former Arsenal captain Cesc Fabregas to maintain Chelsea's unbeaten start to the season and condemn Arsenal to their first Premier League defeat of the campaign. Best of the match Man of the match: Eden Hazard proved a constant threat for Arsenal winning and scoring his penalty Goal of the match: Diego Costa's finish was clinical, but it all came from a perfect through ball from Cesc Fabregas. Moment of the match: There is no love lost between Mourinho and Wenger and they were involved in an angry exchange on the sidelines in the first half. Controversy of the match: Gary Cahill could count himself lucky not to be sent off for a dangerous tackle on Alexis Sanchez which sparked the row between the two managers. Talking point: Can anyone stop Chelsea in the title race? What do Arsenal need to do end their poor record against their top four rivals? After a quiet start Chelsea suffered a scare on ten minutes when goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois suffered a head injury after colliding with Alexis Sanchez, but after lengthy treatment the big Belgian was able to continue. Things threatened to boil over on 20 minutes when Gary Cahill was fortunate to escape with only a yellow card for a dangerous tackle on Sanchez. The incident sparked an angry confrontation between Arsene Wenger and Jose Mourinho on the sidelines with the Arsenal boss shoving his Chelsea counterpart in the chest and the referee Martin Atkinson was forced to give the pair a ticking off. Cesc Fabregas says Arsenal will always be in his heart but he is relishing playing with such great players at Chelsea after their 2-0 win against his forme Cesc Fabregas says Arsenal will always be in his heart but he is relishing playing with such great players at Chelsea after their 2-0 win against his forme Soon after Courtois was forced off to be replaced by Petr Cech as it seemed the goalkeeper had not recovered from that earlier head clash. Chelsea won a penalty on 27 minutes when Hazard burst past Santi Carzola and Calum Chambers with a lovely jinking run into the box before being brought down by Laurent Koscielny. Hazard dusted himself down and took the spot-kick and coolly sent Wojciech Szczesny the wrong way before slotting the ball into the net. Arsenal wasted a great chance to draw level three minutes later when Sanchez picked out Jack Wilshere inside the box, but the midfielder's first touch was poor, allowing Cech to race off his line to collect the ball. Chambers had a lucky escape a minute before the break when already on a booking he brought down Andre Schurrle on the edge of the box, but the referee decided to let the young defender off with a warning rather than a second booking and a red card. Arsenal almost gifted Chelsea a goal just before the hour mark when Hazard beat Chambers down the left and fired over a cross which Mathieu Flamini deflected onto his own post to almost concede an own goal. Jose Mourinho says Arsenal pushed his side and was delighted to claim a difficult win at Stamford Bridge. Jose Mourinho says Arsenal pushed his side and was delighted to claim a difficult win at Stamford Bridge. Arsenal had claims for a penalty on 64 minutes when Jack Wilshere's shot from the edge of the box appeared to strike to the hand of Fabregas, but their protests were waved away. Hazard had a chance to score a second goal 15 minutes from time when Costa superbly held the ball up before finding the winger's run into the box, but from an acute angle Hazard blazed his shot over the top.

The Dane scored five minutes before half-time to settle a contest of few goalscoring chances and lift his team into sixth in the Premier League table.

Talking point: Mauricio Pochettino gets one over his former side as Southampton’s four-match winning run comes to an end and Spurs get back to winning ways after four league games without one. Spurs had dominated the majority of the first half, with Erik Lamela drawing the first good save of the game from Fraser Forster with a low shot after finding space with a run from right to left. Erikson looked to find his range shortly afterwards with an effort from 25 yards which Forster fumbled around his left-hand post. Minutes later, the Dane was on the scoresheet, applying the finish from the edge of the box after being rolled into space by Nacer Chadli’s intelligent pass. The goal did little to inspire Southampton, and although Graziano Pelle forced a comfortable save from Hugo Lloris, Chadli came closest to providing the game’s next goal with a shot that struck the post at the end of a counter-attack. Lloris had to be at his best to hold a Dusan Tadic free-kick that deflected awkwardly off his wall but was not an overworked figure in the Spurs goal. Mauricio Pochettino felt hide showed a lot of fight and teamwork in their win over his former club Southampton.

Victor Wanyama had a firm shot well saved by Hugo Lloris after a long throw had been cleared into his path but the Saints’ best chance of the game fell to Mane.

Stewart Downing whipped in a corner, and under pressure from Sakho, Onuoha poked the ball into his own net. But in the build-up it appeared Enner Valencia had handled the ball before it was diverted in by Onuoha. QPR went close to an equaliser on 24 minutes when Charlie Austin fashioned a chance for himself with a superb nutmeg on James Tomkins before curling in a shot which Adrian pushed out - with the unmarked Niko Kranjcar unhappy that the striker had not passed to him instead of shooting. Redknapp laments poor start Redknapp laments poor start Harry Redknapp threw on former West Ham favourite Bobby Zamora at the start of the second half and he almost had an immediate impact two minutes after the break. Zamora picked up a pass from Leroy Fer wide on the left and picked out Austin's run inside the box with a fine cross only to see his strike partner fire wide from 12 yards. West Ham, who struggled in the early stages of the second half, doubled their lead through Sakho just before the hour mark to take the wind out of QPR's sails. The ball fell to James Tomkins inside the box and the defender hooked his shot goalwards and Sakho was on hand to head home the ball from inside the six-yard box for fourth goal in the last four Premier League games. QPR were lucky not to concede a third goal seconds later when goalkeeper Rob Green passed a free-kick straight to Valencia who slotted the ball into the net, but referee Anthony Taylor disallowed the goal as the West Ham forward was not the required ten yards away from the ball before Green kicked it. QPR tried to find a way back into the game and Kranjcar forced Adrian into a good save with a curling free-kick from 25 yards which the West Ham goalkeeper did well to turn round the post. West Ham substitute Kevin Nolan should have made it 3-0 four minutes from time when Downing got down the left and pulled the back for Nolan inside the box, but his shot was too close to Green who made the save."},{"date": "04/10/2015", "arena": "KCOM Stadium", "attendance": 24281, "home_team": {"name": "Hull City", "lineup": [{"name": "Steve Harper", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [],

his summer switch from West Ham and a late Nikica Jelavic strike were enough to see Hull City to a 2-0 win over Crystal Palace. Midfielder Diame – brought to the KC Stadium by Steve Bruce in August – rose well to head Andrew Robertson’s pinpoint cross beyond Julian Speroni to put the Tigers ahead. BEST OF THE MATCH Man of the Match - Andrew Robertson looks a rare talent and is delivery was superb from the flanks Goal of the Match - Nikica Jelavic’s composed finish sealed the deal for the hosts Save of the Match - Steve Harper tipped over a stinging shot from Yannick Bolasie Moment of the Match - The quality of the Robertson cross to tee up Mo Diame for Hull’s opening goal. Attempt of the Match - A late header from Damien Delaney which was kicked off the line by Liam Rosenior With time almost up, Jelavic ran onto a defence-splitting pass from Jake Livermore and set himself before slotting the ball beyond the Palace keeper. City were good value for the win - their first at the KC Stadium this season - which sees them leapfrog their visitors who created little throughout. Jelavic and Abel Hernandez both missed decent first half openings before Diame rose unchallenged on the hour mark to give City the lead. Neil Warnock threw on Marouane Chamakh and Dwight Gayle soon after falling behind in a bid to get something from the game but the home side continued to look comfortable with the visitors struggling to unlock the home defence. And the game was made safe with just a minute remaining thanks to Jelavic’s cool finish. Palace thought they had managed to get a late goal back within moments of the Croatian international's goal but Liam Rosenior was in the right place to hack Damien Delaney's header off the line. Just as pleasing to Hull boss Steve Bruce will be his side's clean sheet, also a first since the opening day of the season. Bruce's side had shipped 10 goals in their previous four league matches, and another three in the Capital One Cup loss at West Brom, prompting a return to last season's preferred 3-5-2. Mohammed Diame scored his second goal for Hull as they beat Crystal Palace 2-0 at the KC Stadium. Mohammed Diame scored his second goal for Hull as they beat Crystal Palace 2-0 at the KC Stadium. That meant James Chester was back at the heart of defence and Hull were certainly a tighter unit for the tactical switch. It also allowed wing-backs Ahmed Elmohamady and Robertson greater freedom to attack and their energy on the flanks was a constant thorn in Palace's side. The away side, having registered back-to-back wins, came back to earth with a bump and had to wait 74 minutes for their first shot on goal. They started brightly enough, Jason Puncheon and Yannick Bolasie both worrying Hull with their direct running but the back three largely stood firm, allowing Elmohamady and man of the match Robertson to pour forward. Steve Bruce said that Hull thoroughly deserved the three points as they beat Crystal Palace 2-0 Steve Bruce said that Hull thoroughly deserved the three points as they beat Crystal Palace 2-0 Palace held out for the break, though not before Diame and Hernandez had spurned decent openings. Palace began the second half with greater intent but found themselves forced back as Hull responded in kind. First Jelavic drilled a free-kick into the wall after more good work by Robertson; then Elmohamady bustled past two men on the right and pulled the ball back to the edge of the area. Unfortunately for City Curtis Davies was the man arriving and the defender cleared the crossbar by 10 yards. But the pressure finally told with half an hour to go. Huddlestone and Hernandez had driven Hull forward and when the ball broke for Robertson he curled a wonderful cross into the six-yard box. Diame obliged with a crisp header, continuing his rich vein of form. Neil Warnock felt that Crystal Palace didn't take their chances in their 2-0 defeat to Hull. Neil Warnock felt that Crystal Palace didn't take their chances in their 2-0 defeat to Hull. Neil Warnock's side were forced into action and finally made 39-year-old goalkeeper Steve Harper work on his return in place of the injured Allan McGregor. Bolasie was the man to do it, unleashing a powerful strike from 30 yards and forcing a smart reaction save as Harper palmed over. But by committing men forward Palace were increasingly open at the back and Livermore sliced them in two with a superb through ball for Jelavic in the 89th minute. The Croatia striker calmly evaded Martin Kelly then deposited his shot into the far corner to seal the points. Charlie Nicholas’ verdict “Going back to a back three is definitely a positive for Hull. It gives them security at the back and allows Elmohamady and Robertson to blast forward. One thing about the pair of them is they put in lovely service. They are excellent crossers and good passers. Diame did well and I think it suits him sitting in behind Huddlestone, who has a very nice attitude on the ball and ability on both feet. “The bad news for Palace was Scott Dann got a bad injury. He went for a block, but it looks as if he twisted his ankle. It probably leapt into his knee and he had a brace on, so I hope there is better news than it looked. It looks as though he may be out for a while.”"},{"date": "04/10/2015", "arena": "The King Power Stadium", "attendance": 31448, "home_team": {"name": "Leicester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Kasper Schmeichel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ritchie de Laet", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wes Morgan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Liam Moore", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paul Konchesky", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Riyad Mahrez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [72]}, {"name": "Danny Drinkwater", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dean Hammond", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [78]}, {"name": "Jeffrey Schlupp", "yellows": [77], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jamie Vardy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leonardo Ulloa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [63]}], "subs": [{"name": "Matthew James", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [78], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andy King", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Hamer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Anthony Knockaert", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [72], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marcin Wasilewski", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Nugent", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [63], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Wood", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Burnley", "lineup": [{"name": "Tom Heaton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kieran Trippier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [86]}, {"name": "Michael Duff", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jason Shackell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Mee", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Kightly", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [79]}, {"name": "Scott Arfield", "yellows": [54], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stephen Ward", "yellows": [7], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "George Boyd", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [67]}, {"name": "Ashley Barnes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lukas Jutkiewicz", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Daniel Lafferty", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ross Wallace", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [79], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marvin Sordell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [67], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matthew Gilks", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Keane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [86], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin Long", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Hewitt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Premier League: Ross Wallace rescues point for Burnley in 2-2 draw at Leicester Ross Wallace's 96th-minute free-kick rescued Burnley a valuable point in a dramatic 2-2 draw at Leicester City.

BEST OF THE MATCH Man of the match: Riyad Mahrez - The Leicester winger tormented Burnley before running out of gas late on. Goal of the match: Ross Wallace - The Scottish winger grabbed a dramatic point thanks to a sensational last-gasp free-kick. Skill of the match: Jeff Schlupp scored his first ever top flight goal after great work down the flank from Algerian maestro Mahrez. Save of the match: Mahrez eluded two challenges before bringing out a flying one-handed save from Tom Heaton. Gaffe of the match: Referee Phil Dowd was left dazed and confused after taking an elbow flush on the nose. Stat of the match: Burnley's Premier League goal drought ended at 565 minutes; the 10th longest in the competition's history. The Algerian international showed great foot-work down the flank before picking out Jeff Schlupp in the box to score his first top-flight goal. Burnley responded as they ended their 11-hour goal drought to equalise. Scott Arfield's cross was headed down by Lukas Jutkiewicz and Michael Kightly scored on his 200th league appearance. Leicester hit back within a minute, though, as Jamie Vardy's cross deflected off Jason Shackell's heel for Mahrez to head home at the back post. Burnley had to wait until the final minute of stoppage time to grab a share of the spoils when they won a free-kick on the edge of the box and substitute Wallace stepped up to fire his 20-yard effort over the wall and beyond Kasper Schmeichel. The point lifted the Clarets off the bottom of the Barclays Premier League above QPR - at least until Sunday - but they are still winless this season while Leicester remain unbeaten at the King Power Stadium. The Clarets were chasing their first goal in 10 hours and 16 minutes in all competitions going into the game and began brightly, with Jutkiewicz's cross too strong for Barnes. Burnley did not show any anxiety because of their drought but lacked the quality to make an early difference. Ross Wallace came on as a substitute to score a vital equaliser for Burnley. Ross Wallace came on as a substitute to score a vital equaliser for Burnley.

Arfield was given time to find Jutkiewicz in the area and he nodded down to Kightly to slide in ahead of Schmeichel.

It was cruel on the Clarets but they responded well and Jutkiewicz glanced Mee's cross wide soon after the break. Nugent replaced the ineffective Ulloa as Leicester sought a game-clinching third but the visitors continued to press without testing Schmeichel. The keeper was scrambling, though, when Jutkiewicz spun on the edge of the box and fired just wide with 16 minutes left. The Foxes struggled to create in the second half but Heaton was forced into a scrambling save in the final minute from Moore's header. But in the fifth minute of injury time Burnley levelled when Jutkiewicz was felled by Matty James and the midfielder found the top corner from the free-kick."},{"date": "04/10/2015", "arena":

These were golden chances and for all Liverpool's possession, their opponents, looking for their third consecutive league win, were never going to be pushovers and the on-song Berahino proved to be a handful all afternoon and was denied an opener from a smart smothering save by Simon Mignolet. Berahino also wastefully nodded over, but just before the interval the mood inside Anfield changed from anxious to elation as Lallana danced his way past three defenders, picked up the return pass from Henderson before rifling past Foster. Back came Alan Irvine’s lively visitors after their refreshment as they got their reward for not panicking with a spot-kick after Dejan Lovren tripped Berahino on the edge of the box. The Liverpool defence were incensed with the decision, but despite the chaos, the striker coolly buried it to level the score. It was a lead that lasted only five minutes. Raheem Sterling was unlucky not to get a penalty himself after being bundled over by Craig Gardner and as the defenders tried desperately to clear the ball, Henderson was lurking and smashed in the rebound. Jordan Henderson said Liverpool showed character to beat West Brom 2-1 in a close contest at Anfield. Jordan Henderson said Liverpool showed character to beat West Brom 2-1 in a close contest at Anfield. Lambert was roundly applauded for his efforts as he was replaced by Balotelli and strangely it was the lively Italian who brought an air of calmness to the pitch with some neat touches in the middle, which included a shinned miss from the edge of the box. West Brom chased down everything in search of another equaliser and Berahino should have done better with a close-range header but as Balotelli wasted a great chance for a third after a sweet move with Gerrard, it was the hosts who held on for a much-needed victory. West Brom boss Alan Irvine felt his side did enough to take something from the game against Liverpool. West Brom boss Alan Irvine felt his side did enough to take something from the game against Liverpool. Paul Merson’s verdict “There seems to be a spark missing around the whole place with Liverpool – on the pitch, with the manager and with the fans. It’s not like it was last year, nowhere near. Last year they were buzzing the ball around and the movement was as good as I’ve seen from any team. It’s not the case any more. They are stuttering along at the moment. “There’s something missing and I think it would be Sturridge because they are pace-less up front. Lallana was the one trying to make things happen and if it didn’t happen he would get back on the ball and try again. I thought he did what he did at Southampton and if he plays like that he is a good, good player.”"},{"date": "04/10/2015", "arena": "Stadium of Light", "attendance": 42713, "home_team": {"name": "Sunderland", "lineup": [{"name": "Vito Mannone", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Billy Jones", "yellows": [64], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Santiago Vergini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John O'Shea", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Patrick van Aanholt", "yellows": [67], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lee Cattermole", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Will Buckley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [60]}, {"name": "Sebastian Larsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [71]}, {"name": "Jordi Gomez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [71]}, {"name": "Connor Wickham", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Fletcher", "yellows": [70], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Costel Pantilimon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Liam Bridcutt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [71], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wes Brown", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Rodwell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [71], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Johnson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [60], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jozy Altidore", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charis Mavrias", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Stoke City", "lineup": [{"name": "Asmir Begovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Bardsley", "yellows": [66], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Shawcross", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marc Wilson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marc Muniesa", "yellows": [27], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven N'Zonzi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Glenn Whelan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marko Arnautovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charlie Adam", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [70]}, {"name": "Victor Moses", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [18]}, {"name": "Peter Crouch", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [78]}], "subs": [{"name": "Erik Pieters", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robert Huth", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stephen Ireland", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jon Walters", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [78], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Oussama Assaidi", "yellows": [62], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [18], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bojan", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [70], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Thomas Sorensen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Steven Fletcher: Celebrates his first goal since December Steven Fletcher's first goals of 2014 helped Sunderland earn their opening win of the season as they beat Stoke 3-1 at the Stadium of Light. Black Cats' boss Gus Poyet changed his team around and elected for two strikers with Fletcher brought back into the side, and the gamble paid off. Best of the Match Man of the Match: Steven Fletcher. Back in the goals at long last. Goal of the Match: Charlie Adam. Excellent finish after fine run into the box. Save of the Match: Vito Mannone. Got down well to smother Crouch header. Talking Points: Can Sunderland push on from here? Should Fletcher and Wickham be partnered again? Are Stoke in trouble? Connor Wickham gave the home side an early lead after great work from Fletcher down the right, but Charlie Adam brilliantly slid the ball into the Sunderland net to equalise just 10 minutes later. Fletcher then got himself on the scoresheet for the first time in 2014, steering a header past Asmir Begovic with the marking leaving much to be desired. The second-half was much more cagey, the home side looking very nervous with just a one-goal lead, however Fletcher's second 12 minutes from time sealed the hosts' first win of the season, and a huge sigh of relief was to be heard all around Wearside. The result sees Sunderland leapfrog Stoke to move up to 11th in the Premier League table, with the Potters slipping to 15th. The match began at a frantic pace, with both sides willing to get forward in numbers. And in a fixture has produced just six goals in the previous five meetings between this pair, everyone was surprised to see the deadlock broken so quickly. Steven Fletcher was pleased to get back on the scoresheet again as Sunderland beat Stoke 3-1. Steven Fletcher was pleased to get back on the scoresheet again as Sunderland beat Stoke 3-1. Fletcher was at the heart of it, turning quickly from a throw-in, getting a bit of luck in reaching the byline, but there was nothing lucky about the pinpoint cross that picked out Wickham, who arched his back to guide the ball past Asmir Begovic with his head. Steven N’Zonzi should have at least tested Vito Mannone in the Sunderland goal straight away, but his tame effort was easy for the Italian to smother. But the Potters didn’t have to wait long for a leveller. A quick free-kick caught the home side napping, Adam nipped in, beat one man before cleverly passing the ball through the legs of Santiago Vergini and past Mannone. However, Stoke boss Mark Hughes will be unhappy that his side once again fell behind. Sebastian Larsson’s quick corner was taken short, and the Swede picked out Fletcher, who too easily evaded the attentions of Marc Wilson, and guided a header past Mannone for his first goal since his strike against Cardiff last December. Stoke boss Mark Hughes says his side were below the level of performance they are capable of Stoke boss Mark Hughes says his side were below the level of performance they are capable of Ryan Shawcross had a great chance to equalise from a corner down the other end, but his header, while powerful, flew onto the roof of the net. Should really have hit the target from close-range. Just before the interval, Peter Crouch drew a smart save from Mannone, who got down very well to his right to keep out a well-directed header. The intensity of the match slowed right down after the break, with the home side looking nervous as Stoke pressed for an equaliser. The Potters got themselves into some excellent positions, but the final ball was lacking when it really counted. Referee Neil Swarbrick dished out several yellow cards as the tackles started to fly in as both sides grew more frustrated with their poor retention of possession. Sunderland boss Gus Poyet was delighted with his side Sunderland boss Gus Poyet was delighted with his side But one moment of brilliance from Wickham settled the match, and brought some much needed cheer to Wearside. Running at the heart of the Stoke defence, Wickham avoided several challenges, stayed on his feet, worked his way into the box and unselfishly squared the ball for substitute Jack Rodwell, who got away with missing his kick completely as Fletcher followed up to seal the points. Matt Le Tissier’s verdict “Fletcher scored his first league goal for a year, which is a heck of a drought and what normally happens when you haven’t scored one for a while is the second one comes along soon afterwards. The relief was there for all to see. Although Stoke probably had the majority of possession and possibly even the majority of chances at goal, Sunderland were probably good value for the win. “I think the injury to Victor Moses threw Stoke a little bit. He was a big difference on Monday night when they beat Newcastle, so for him to go off so early in the game was a big blow for Stoke. They put Bojan on when they were trying to chase the game and again he had no real affect at all. That will be one of the big disappointments so far this season for Mark Hughes.”"},{"date": "04/10/2015", "arena": "The Liberty Stadium", "attendance": 20622, "home_team": {"name": "Swansea City",

have helped ease the pressure on under-fire boss Alan Pardew . 17 minutes into the game, Gylfi Sigurdsson played a wonderfully-weighted ball through to Wilfried Bony, who placed it past Tim Krul to give the Swans the lead. Best of the match Man of the Match: Papiss Cisse’s double was invaluable for Alan Pardew, who’s been under a monumental amount of pressure. The Magpies striker was a handful for Swansea’s back four. Save of the match: Tim Krul pulled off a magnificent second-half save to deny Wilfried Bony his second of the game, which helped Newcastle claim a point. Goal of the match: Wayne Routledge’s dinked effort to put Swansea 2-1 up was wonderfully executed, with the former Newcastle man showing why he’s been linked with an England call-up. Moment of the match: With Swansea looking relatively comfortably, Cisse’s second equaliser really sucker punched the home side and revitalised a previously poor Newcastle side. Talking point: Can Newcastle push on from this result? They remain in the relegation zone, but showed promise in the latter stages of the game. Garry Monk’s side could have doubled the lead when Bony volleyed the ball towards the bottom-right corner, but the Magpies’ Dutch keeper did magnificently to turn the ball around the post. Moments before half-time, Cisse grabbed an unexpected equaliser after he prodded a Gabriel Obertan cross beyond a stranded Lukasz Fabianski. However, just five minutes after the break, former Magpies winger Wayne Routledge lifted the ball over a sprawling Krul to put the home side back in front. Despite Swansea looking good value for their lead, Newcastle broke on the counter attack and Cisse levelled from five yards after some superb play from substitute Sammy Ameobi. Both sides had chances to win the game, but it finished all-square in South Wales – a result that will undoubtedly give Pardew more time as Newcastle manager. The Newcastle fans voiced their displeasure at both Pardew and owner Mike Ashley - who was present at the Liberty Stadium - regularly during an entertaining contest, with the visitors desperately short of confidence and still seeking their first win of the league campaign. Wilfried Bony: Opened the scoring for Swansea Swansea had made their best start to a Premier League campaign but they had gone three games without a win and it showed as both sides took time to settle. An early spell of shadow boxing ended when Obertan fired just wide and the chance seemed to spur Swansea into action at the other end. Bony played Ki Sung-yueng's pass to Sigurdsson and a simple one-two saw the Ivorian bear down on goal and slot home past Krul for his first goal since scoring for the Ivory Coast at the World Cup in Brazil. It was also Sigurdsson's fifth assist of a productive Premier League season but from a Newcastle perspective their defence had been breached far too easily. Wayne Routledge: Scored well-executed chip to make it 2-1 Shelvey's delicate chip cleared Krul's crossbar following some slick Swans approach play and the hosts almost doubled their advantage after 38 minutes. Another free-flowing move had threatened to break down but Sigurdsson helped it onto Nathan Dyer and he beat his marker Paul Dummett with ease. Dyer's cross found Bony but Krul produced an excellent save to divert his volley wide at the expense of a corner. Newcastle had barely functioned as an attacking force but two minutes before half-time, Obertan got the better of Neil Taylor and Cisse stole across Ashley Williams at the near post to beat Fabianski in the Swansea goal. Alan Pardew: Newcastle showed 'great character' Alan Pardew: Newcastle showed 'great character' Swansea responded immediately with Bony seeing a shot blocked by his skipper Williams before driving a fierce effort over, but Newcastle's luck held only until five minutes into the second half. Sigurdsson held off Moussa Sissoko, perhaps too forcefully for Pardew's liking, to slip a pass into Routledge's path with Dummett playing him onside in the left-back position. Krul came rushing off his line but Routledge nonchalantly beat him with a delightful chip to restore Swansea's lead. Newcastle were making little attacking headway and came close to conceding a third when Sigurdsson's back heel found Bony who just failed to keep his chip under Krul's bar. Garry Monk: Disappointed with Swansea's home draw Garry Monk: Disappointed with Swansea's home draw Bony was almost on the scoresheet again when he met Dyer's centre sweetly and Krul pulled a save from right out of the top drawer. And that stop proved more important moments later when substitute Ameobi evaded the challenge of Federico Fernandez and crossed for Cisse to volley home from close range. Cisse almost completed his hat-trick with 10 minutes remaining when Emmanuel Riviere's blocked shot fell to him inside the six-yard area but he couldn't maintain his balance and the chance was lost."},{"date": "04/10/2015", "arena": "Villa Park", "attendance": 32964, "home_team": {"name": "Aston Villa", "lineup": [{"name": "Brad Guzan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals":

Best of the match Man of the match: David Silva ran the show for Manchester City as he pulled the strings in midfield Goal of the match: Yaya Toure produced a moment of magic as he broke the deadlock with a superb left-footed shot past Brad Guzan. Miss of the match: Sergio Aguero really should have scored early in the second half when he somehow hit the post with only Guzan to beat. Save of the match: Guzan was the busier of the two goalkeepers and he produced a superb reaction save to keep out Silva's shot in the second half. Talking point: Will Toure's goal help him find his best form again after a difficult start? How big a boost is it for Villa to have Benteke back Moment of the match: Christian Benteke making a welcome return to action after six months out with a serious Achilles injury With 25 chances created to Villa’s six, few would dispute the result and with Aguero smashing in a second, this victory will go some way to ease the disappointment of the midweek Champions League draw with Roma, along with keeping the heat on Premier League leaders Chelsea. Yaya Toure made the breakthrough for Man City with time running out Yaya Toure made the breakthrough for Man City with time running out For all their toil, Villa suffered their third successive defeat (conceded eight and scored none in three games) but they should take heart from a stirring defensive performance for long periods, with the biggest cheer of the afternoon left for Christian Benteke, making his first appearance in the second half for the first time in six months. City though began this match how they finished – pushing for goals – and only the woodwork denied Aleksandar Kolarov an opener after his deflected shot crashed against the upright via a deflection off Alan Hutton. Villa weren’t without their chances with Toure having to be at his best to force the marauding Charles N’Zogbia to fire just wide, while Andreas Weimann also proved to be a menace around the box. Yaya Toure went some of the way to silencing his critics this season as he scored to help Manchester City to victory over Aston Villa. Yaya Toure went some of the way to silencing his critics this season as he scored to help Manchester City to victory over Aston Villa. As the break approached, the spectacle of a grizzly Manuel Pellegrini on the touchline may have been the inspiration for his toothless attacking force but City could have notched four in the dying minutes of the first period. Aguero’s glancing header from Kolarov’s curling cross dropped narrowly over, Edin Dzeko blasted high and wide from close range and then the Bosnian striker saw a header hacked away by Aly Cissokho. It was desperate, heroic and at times fortunate defending by Villa but they held firm and again luck was on their side 100 seconds after the break as Aguero blasted against the post. The start to the second half was breathless at both ends and Villa broke away immediately as Kieran Richardson’s sloppy first touch denied him a clear shooting opportunity in the box. Paul Lambert praised the effort his side gave as they were undone by two late goals in their defeat to Manchester City. Paul Lambert praised the effort his side gave as they were undone by two late goals in their defeat to Manchester City. City stormed back as Guzan reacted fantastically to palm away Silva’s deflected shot and the Spaniard was at it again, shooting at the keeper after a wonderful weaving run. With Villa’s players running on empty, it was left for Guzan to keep his side in contention as he shut out Eliaquim Mangala's header and a tame punt from substitute Frank Lampard. The impossible seemed perfectly possible on 82 minutes for the hosts, only for Toure to take centre stage and deliver his first goal of the season with Ageuro adding icing to the cake with his late strike."},{"date": "29/09/2015", "arena": "Bet365 Stadium", "attendance": 26332, "home_team": {"name": "Stoke City", "lineup": [{"name": "Asmir Begovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [],

1-0 at the Britannia to add to pressure on Alan Pardew Peter Crouch scored the winner as Stoke beat Newcastle 1-0 at the Britannia to pile more pressure on Magpies boss Alan Pardew. Crouch headed home Victor Moses' cross from the left in the 15th minute to put Mark Hughes' side ahead and the hosts should then have had a penalty when Moses was brought down in the box by Yoan Gouffran, but no spot-kick was awarded. Best of the match Man of the match: Goals win games and it was Peter Crouch who decided this one. Victor Moses was a constant threat but should have scored one-on-one with keeper Tim Krul. Shot of match: Daryl Janmaat hit a great effort late on in the first period which Asmir Begovic did well to save diving low to his right. Save of the match: As above – Begovic from Janmaat. Moment of the match: Jack Colback hitting the bar with seven minutes remaining when he should have salvaged a point for Newcastle. Talking points: Will Alan Pardew now be sacked after failing to win in the league again? Also, Moses had a strong penalty shout following a challenge by Yoan Gouffran in the box. At the other end, Daryl Janmaat's shot from a corner drew a great save from Asmir Begovic late on in the first period. Papiss Cisse was introduced by Newcastle at the start of the second half but, unlike the brace he scored to earn a point against Hull City last time in the Premier League, he could not find a way through to salvage a draw for Pardew this time. Instead, after substitute Marko Arnautovic had hit the post for Stoke early on in the second period, it was Jack Colback who had Newcastle's best chance but his shot from close range hit the crossbar with seven minutes remaining as the Potters held on for their first home win in the league this season. Ahead of this Monday Night Football clash, Magpies owner Mike Ashley - who the club insist was joking with the comment - said Pardew would be \"finished\" if it ended in defeat. And, certainly, it will be interesting to see what the future now holds for Pardew after a performance from the Tyneside outfit that hardly supported the case for him to keep his job, and was watched by Ashley from the stands. Alan Pardew vows to fight on at Newcastle Alan Pardew vows to fight on at Newcastle After a scrappy opening to the game in which Steven Nzonzi and then Emmanuel Riviere struck off-target, one of several moments of quality from Moses - and some hesitant Newcastle defending - led to the deadlock being broken. The on-loan Chelsea winger got the better of Janmaat on the left flank and sent in a delivery that Crouch, outjumping Magpies skipper Fabricio Coloccini, crashed into the net. As the lofty frontman wheeled away in delight, cries - seemingly from fans of both clubs - of \"you're getting sacked in the morning\" rang out around the stadium and Pardew looked very worried indeed. Coloccini fired over the Stoke bar moments later, while a loud clap of thunder breaking out over the ground only added to the sense of gloom surrounding his sodden manager. Threatening again Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher said that Peter Crouch gave Stoke something Newcastle haven't got after his winning goal gave the Potters a 1-0 win. Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher said that Peter Crouch gave Stoke something Newcastle haven't got after his winning goal gave the Potters a 1-0 win. The Potters were soon threatening again, with Moses latching on to a Mame Biram Diouf ball and going to ground in the area under a challenge from Gouffran. Despite Stoke protests, referee Craig Pawson did not award a penalty and as play continued, Moussa Sissoko rifled an effort wide at the other end. Diouf - having injured himself as he played the pass to Moses - was withdrawn for Arnautovic. Janmaat had a shot blocked by home captain Ryan Shawcross and Newcastle were then on the back foot again as Moses played in Crouch, who skewed his effort wide as Paul Dummett closed him down. Reaction from Stoke scorer Crouch, and Moses Reaction from Stoke scorer Crouch, and Moses There was a further scare for the visitors when a Marc Muniesa cross came via Mike Williamson to Crouch, the resulting header being cleared by Coloccini. Newcastle responded with a brief spell of pressure which saw Dummett's shot deflect over and Janmaat then drill one that Begovic - called into action more or less for the first time - pushed away at full stretch. But Pardew's men looked vulnerable again just before the break as Moses cut through them once more and Arnautovic cracked the ball goalwards, with Dummett doing well to make the block. Williamson: Players behind Pardew Williamson: Players behind Pardew Pardew looked to give fresh impetus to his attack by introducing Cisse for Riviere at the interval, but Newcastle were soon breathing another sigh of relief as the second half got under way as Arnautovic's strike came back off the post. And some woeful attempts by the away side to clear just after the hour mark saw the ball ricochet through to Moses, whose close-range shot hit the legs of goalkeeper Tim Krul. Substitute Stephen Ireland saw a shot go off-target, before Crouch's penalty appeal for a tug on his shirt from Williamson was turned down. Hughes looking to push on Hughes looking to push on Newcastle, meanwhile, were in desperate need of of a saviour, and it looked like Colback might be the man in the 83rd minute - but, when the ball dropped to him right in front of goal, he could only fire it against the frame and then hold his head in disbelief. Overall, Hughes' team were value for what were their first points at home in the Premier League this season and takes them from 17th up to 11th. The Magpies stay second-bottom and without a league victory this term. They have won only once in 14 top-flight games stretching back to 2013/14, with 10 of those being losses - and Pardew must be wondering if his time is up."},{"date": "28/09/2015", "arena": "The

Berahino doubled the advantage just before the break Saido Berahino scored twice as West Brom cruised to a 4-0 home win over Burnley in the Premier League on Sunday. The Clarets had drawn their previous three games 0-0 but their defence was put under pressure by the Hawthorns hosts from the first whistle and was breached by Craig Dawson on the half-hour mark before Berahino netted twice either side of the interval. Jamie Carragher and Kevin Phillips discuss how Burnley lacked belief after going a goal down against West Brom Jamie Carragher and Kevin Phillips discuss how Burnley lacked belief after going a goal down against West Brom The England Under-21 forward now has five goals for the season, with the Clarets having netted just once between them. Best of the Match Man of the Match: With two well-taken goals and movement that troubled Burnley all afternoon, Saido Berahino gets the nod just ahead of West Brom team-mate Graham Dorrans. Goal of the Match: Berahino's second was the pick of the bunch, as he timed his run perfectly to run onto Dorrans' through-ball before slotting the shot past Heaton. Talking Point: Can West Brom continue their upturn in form by getting a result at Liverpool next time out? And where are the goals Burnley so desperately need going to come from? They have not scored in eight hours and 46 minutes in the Premier League and already look destined for a long fight against the drop. Graham Dorrans wrapped up the win - Albion's third in a row in all competitions - with a strike from inside the area in the 90th minute. The victory lifts Alan Irvine's Baggies to 10th in the table after six games, while Burnley sink to the bottom on goal difference. Reaction from Berahino and Brunt Reaction from Berahino and Brunt Irvine named an unchanged Albion side from their 1-0 win at Tottenham last week, their first victory of the season under their new head coach. Berahino started after coming off the bench to score the late winner in Wednesday's 3-2 Capital Cup win over Hull. Victor Anichebe and Brown Ideye were ruled out with hernia and ankle injuries respectively. Burnley recalled Ross Wallace, Michael Kightly and Steven Reid, who left the Baggies in the summer after a four-year stay at The Hawthorns. David Jones (thigh) and Dean Marney (hamstring) failed to recover from their injuries after starting last week's 0-0 draw with Sunderland. Burnley had not scored in the league in 436 minutes coming into the game and their lack of quality was evident from the start. Kightly shot over for the Clarets before Chris Brunt's drive deflected off Michael Duff and dropped inches wide after 15 minutes. Irvine delighted with performance Irvine delighted with performance Berahino drilled across goal as the hosts took charge and tried to add to their own measly goal tally of just one in the last 376 minutes of league football before the game. And the opener came on 30 minutes to reward the Baggies for their more inventive play when Dawson headed in Brunt's deep corner from five yards. It was bitter for Burnley, who had three bids rejected for the defender - who also handed in a transfer request - in the summer. Brunt then volleyed over four minutes before the break and Tom Heaton superbly turned Dorrans' fierce 25-yard drive behind. Albion were hunting a second and it came in first-half injury time as Berahino netted his fourth of the season, nodding in from a yard out after Dorrans flicked on James Morrison's corner. Dorrans and Berahino: On the scoresheet Burnley offered little resistance with the Baggies in total control, and they hauled off Wallace and Reid for Nathaniel Chalobah and Ashley Barnes at half-time. Chalobah's first action was to pick up a yellow card for a foul on Dorrans and the changes made little difference. The composed hosts continued to press as Craig Gardner's deflected effort arrowed wide and Ben Mee blocked Stephane Sessegnon's volley. Albion confirmed their dominance with a third on 56 minutes when Dorrans' pass split the Burnley defence for Berahino to drill low into the corner from 15 yards. Dyche: We never got a grip Dyche: We never got a grip There was no way back for the visitors, although Ben Foster did well to keep out Lukas Jutkiewicz's header on 66 minutes.

Captain Steven Gerrard’s 65th minute free-kick appeared to give Liverpool a third Premier League win of the season until centre-half Jagielka thumped home a leveller in the second minute of added time. Brendan Rodgers thinks Liverpool were much the better side following their 1-1 draw with local rivals Everton. Brendan Rodgers thinks Liverpool were much the better side following their 1-1 draw with local rivals Everton. Everton midfielder Gareth Barry endured a torrid start to the game after being booked inside the first minute before almost conceding a penalty when the ball struck his raised arm and then bringing down Mario Balotelli. Liverpool looked more threatening as Tim Howard saved from Balotelli, Adam Lallana and Raheem Sterling, while Everton lost Kevin Mirallas due to a hamstring injury. The second half finally sprung into life 20 minutes after the break when Balotelli was fouled just outside the box and Gerrard curled a free-kick over the wall and just beyond Howard. Romelu Lukaku had an immediate chance to equalise, but glanced a header straight at Simon Mignolet, and then Balotelli’s volley from six yards out brushed Howard’s face before striking the crossbar. Best of the Match Man of the Match: Adam Lallana was quieter in the second half but showed plenty of verve before the break Goal of the Match: Phil Jagielka’s wonder strike from 25 yards to give Everton a dramatic late equaliser Save of the Match: Tim Howard managed to get something on Mario Balotelli’s volley from close range and force it onto the bar and over Moment of the match: Gareth Barry’s two early fouls in rapid succession could well have seen him booked for both and off the field with some of the crowd still finding their seats Attempt of the match: Gareth Barry’s late flick was just wide of the target and could have pinched all three points for Everton Talking point: Liverpool’s slow start to the season goes on as they let a winning position slip through their hands Brendan Rodgers’ side appeared to be comfortably holding on to the win until Jagielka’s first-time shot from 25 yards swerved away from Mignolet and rocketed into the top corner. There was a surprise in the Everton team, with veteran full-back Tony Hibbert making his first league start since December 2012 in place of the injured Seamus Coleman. Midfielder Muhamed Besic made his first league start for the visitors while Liverpool were again without influential striker Daniel Sturridge, who had targeted a return in this game from a thigh injury. The Merseyside derby has not disappointed in recent years, although the red half of the city has had much the better of it. As well as going 15 years without a win at Anfield, Everton were looking for a first derby win of any kind in four years. The game started at a frenetic pace and referee Martin Atkinson might have given two penalties and a red card in the opening 10 minutes. Barry was booked for a foul on Lallana inside the first minute and the Liverpool fans were baying for blood when he brought down Balotelli, but Atkinson kept his cards in his pocket this time. Everton were the first to appeal for a spot-kick when Alberto Moreno appeared to bring down Lukaku but Atkinson said no, as he did four minutes later when Sterling's shot struck Barry's arm. The hosts were attacking with verve and lots of pace, keen to get on top of Everton's leaky defence early on. Following Barry's second foul, Balotelli drew Howard into a first save with a deflected free-kick, and from the corner the American reacted brilliantly to keep out Lallana's header. The boyhood Everton fan looked particularly bright, and the space down the flanks created by the visitors’ narrow midfield was giving full-backs Moreno and Javier Manquillo plenty of space to attack into. Gerrard: Gave Liverpool the lead Applying the finishing touch was the problem, though, and Balotelli lacked the necessary conviction on a number of occasions as he sought his first Premier League goal for the Reds. Everton's attacks were ponderous in comparison, although Leighton Baines did get away down the left and rolled the ball across goal, where it was scrambled clear by Dejan Lovren. The visitors were dealt a blow on the half-hour mark when Mirallas appeared to pull a hamstring in full flight and was carried off to be replaced by Aiden McGeady. The good news for Everton was the league's worst defence was holding up well and, when Liverpool did get through, Howard was on form, keeping out shots from Jordan Henderson and Sterling as the half drew to a close. Liverpool were straight on the attack after the break and James McCarthy did superbly to foil Lazar Markovic as he looked to convert a Sterling through ball. Mirallas: Suffered injury On the hour mark the Serbian was taken off to be replaced by Philippe Coutinho, and five minutes later Liverpool finally made the breakthrough. Baines was judged to have brought down Balotelli 22 yards out and, although Howard got a hand to Gerrard's free-kick, he could not keep it out. Two minutes later it should have been two as Sterling got away down the left before crossing for Balotelli, who hit the top of the bar from six yards. Martinez responded by sending on 20-year-old Tyias Browning for his debut in place of Hibbert, while Samuel Eto'o came on for Besic in a final throw of the dice. Everton piled on the pressure without really looking like finding a leveller until Jagielka's dramatic intervention, and Barry could even have won it with a late back-heel."},{"date": "27/09/2015", "arena": "Stamford Bridge", "attendance": 41616, "home_team": {"name": "Chelsea", "lineup": [{"name": "Thibaut Courtois", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Branislav Ivanovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gary Cahill", "yellows": [26], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Terry", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "César Azpilicueta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cesc Fàbregas", "yellows": [58], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nemanja Matic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willian", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Oscar", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [77]}, {"name": "Eden Hazard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [68]}, {"name": "Diego Costa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [81]}], "subs": [{"name": "Petr Cech", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Filipe Luis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kurt Zouma", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Didier Drogba", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Mikel Obi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [77], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "André Schürrle", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [68], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Loïc Remy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [81], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Aston Villa", "lineup": [{"name": "Brad Guzan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alan Hutton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Philippe Senderos", "yellows": [62], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathan Baker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aly Cissokho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Cleverley", "yellows": [51], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Westwood", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fabian Delph", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andreas Weimann", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [69]}, {"name": "Gabriel Agbonlahor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kieran  Richardson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [69]}], "subs": [{"name": "Ciaran Clark", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leandro Bacuna", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Darren Bent", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [69], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Carlos Sánchez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charles N'Zogbia", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [69], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shay Given", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Grealish", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Chelsea handed Jose Mourinho a victory in his 250th game in charge of the club, beating Aston Villa 3-0 to cement their spot at the top of the Premier League. Oscar (7) stroked in the opener, Diego Costa (59) – with his eighth goal in six Premier League games since signing from Atletico Madrid for £32million – knocked in a second and Willian brushed in a third (79) to maintain the Blues’ 100 per cent home record. John Terry was pleased with Chelsea’s performance in their 3-0 win at home to Aston Villa. John Terry was pleased with Chelsea’s performance in their 3-0 win at home to Aston Villa. The comprehensive win leaves Chelsea three points clear at the summit as they chase a first Premier League title since 2010. The Londoners defeated Manchester United 1-0 in Mourinho’s first league game at the Chelsea helm in 2004 – and it took them little time at all to move into that scoreline against a Villa side thumped 3-0 at home by Arsenal in their previous match. Oscar, who netted his first goal of the campaign in the Capital One Cup win over Bolton in midweek, converted Willian’s pass to score from six yards Willian had seen his initial attempt pawed away by Brad Guzan having been found by Branislav Ivanovic down the right, but the Brazilian remained alert and squared the rebound into his countryman’s path. BEST OF THE MATCH Man of the match – Cesc Fabregas. The Spaniard was pushed hard by Willian but the midfielder pulled the strings throughout as Chelsea kept possession wonderfully well. Moment of the match: Costa got a goal but it was his dummy in the build up to Willian’s tap-in which was sublime as he seated three defenders. Save of the match – Guzan was certainly the busier of the two goalkeepers and made a great save to deny Willian only to see the rebound drop for the Brazilian to feed Oscar for the opener. Goal of the match - Terrific interplay from Eden Hazard and Willian down the left resulted in Cesar Azpilicueta chipping into the penalty area for Costa to head home Winger Willian almost went from provider to scorer after 15 minutes, but, after latching onto a beautiful back flick from Costa, saw his shot clip off Nathan Baker and hit the side-netting. Cesc Fabregas was pulling the strings in the centre of the park – a delightful slide-rule pass just evaded buccaneering right-back Ivanovic and nestled into Guzan’s gloves – and the former Barcelona man skewed a strike wide soon after as the hosts continued to control the contest. Chelsea’s next two attempts were both headers – Costa flicking an enticing cross from the ever-lively Willian into Guzan’s mitts and Ivanovic nodding a Fabregas corner over the bar – before Costa and then Willian whipped in shots too high and wide to test Villa’s American stopper. The visitors were finding it tough to get a foothold and chances were at a premium, too, with Chelsea skipper John Terry – who made his Blues debut against Villa in a League Cup tie in 1998 – blocking crosses, and a Fabian Delph snapshot, at will. The Midlanders’ only moments of note came when left-back Aly Cissokho clipped wide from a corner under pressure from Nemanja Matic, and frontman Andreas Weimann was crowded out by the Blues' rearguard before he could get a strike away. And after Willian fired wide, official Phil Dowd – the referee when Villa were thumped 8-0 at Stamford Bridge in December 2012 – brought an end to a first period in which Gary Cahill was booked for a cynical swipe on Gabriel Agbonlahor. Jose Mourinho praised his Chelsea team’s strength and was pleased with their all-round performance as they beat Aston Villa 3-0 at Stamford Bridge. Jose Mourinho praised his Chelsea team’s strength and was pleased with their all-round performance as they beat Aston Villa 3-0 at Stamford Bridge. Villa had the first attempt of the second half - England new boy Delph rasping a 25-yard strike wide of Thibaut Courtois’ sticks – and were getting a modicum of joy in Chelsea territory with the pace of Agbonlahor and the graft of Kieran Richardson. Baker headed Ashley Westwood’s free-kick onto the roof of the net but Chelsea responded through Costa, who first nodded an Ivanovic centre into the grateful arms of Guzan and then scored the hosts' second. Terrific interplay from Eden Hazard and Willian down the left resulted in Cesar Azpilicueta chipping into the penalty area and Costa – who amassed 27 goals in all competitions for Atletico last term – heading his side further in front. Paul Lambert felt Aston Villa looked comfortable and solid despite losing 3-0 to Chelsea and said the score line was a bit harsh on the team. Paul Lambert felt Aston Villa looked comfortable and solid despite losing 3-0 to Chelsea and said the score line was a bit harsh on the team. Mourinho’s men were turning the screw, with Oscar seeing his poke past Guzan cleared off the line by Cissokho, Matic quelled by Philippe Senderos as he tried to get his head to a Fabregas in-swinger, and Costa narrowly avoid making contact with Hazard’s pearl of a ball into the box. Hazard had danced past Alan Hutton to fashion Costa’s chance, but Villa’s right-back – back in Paul Lambert’s good books and the recent recipient of a new three-year contract – surged upfield shortly after and tested Courtois with a low drive. However, the Scot saw his side drop further behind on 79 minutes when Costa’s effort was parried by Guzan, flicked off the unlucky Cissokho and livewire Willian was presented with a simple tap-in to make it three."},{"date": "27/09/2015", "arena": "Selhurst Park", "attendance": 24311, "home_team": {"name": "Crystal Palace", "lineup": [{"name": "Julian Speroni", "yellows": [], "reds": [],

Fraizer Campbell and Mile Jedinak help Crystal Palace to 2-0 win over Leicester Mile Jedinak (15): Scored in Crystal Palace's 2-0 win over Leicester Crystal Palace made it two wins in two Premier League games after their 2-0 victory over Leicester City at Selhurst Park. Leicester’s Jamie Vardy had the best chance of a battling first half, with the former Fleetwood Town man seeing his shot from six yards well saved by a sprawling Julian Speroni. Palace lacked a clinical edge in the opening 45 minutes, but could have taken the lead when Jason Puncheon’s rasping drive was well saved by keeper Kasper Schmeichel. However, the game sparked into life just over five minutes into the second half, when Palace striker Fraizer Campbell opened the scoring after diverting a Mile Jedinak knockdown beyond Schmeichel. Best of the Match Man of the match: Mile Jedinak put in a fantastically combative midfield performance for Crystal Palace today, and capped off a great display with a goal. Moment of the match: Jedinak’s goal to double Palace’s lead left Leicester utterly shell-shocked, and the Foxes were incapable of grabbing a quick response. Save of the match: Julian Speroni’s save to deny Jamie Vardy in the first-half was vital, and the Argentine deserved to leave the game with a clean-sheet under his name. Talking point: With Palace securing back-to-back Premier League wins, can they improve on last season’s 11th place finish by grabbing a spot in the top-half? Moments later, the Eagles doubled their lead when Jedinak headed past the Foxes goalkeeper to secure all three points for Neil Warnock’s side – a win that moves Palace into eighth and pushes Leicester down into ninth. The Eagles have now taken eight points from Warnock's four league games in charge as the 65-year-old recalled all 11 players who had started the 3-2 win at Everton. Leicester, too, were unchanged from their shock 5-3 win over Manchester United last weekend but their feet were brought firmly back to the ground in south London as they failed to reach the heights of recent weeks. Vardy, the catalyst for Leicester's heroic comeback, had the game's first chance but could not beat Speroni, who did well to keep out a driven effort. Campbell also passed up a good opportunity to open the scoring but headed Puncheon's free-kick straight at Schmechel in the Foxes' goal.

James McArthur forced a corner after collecting a Campbell knockdown and curling in an effort, with Joe Ledley's header from the resulting set-piece hacked off the line by Esteban Cambiasso. Schmeichel was on hand to push away an arrowing strike from Puncheon moments later as Leicester were beginning to get pegged back. Referee Keith Stroud was not endearing himself to the home fans after awarding a number of free-kicks to Leicester but he made the right decision to wave away claims for a Palace penalty as Yannick Bolasie went down under pressure from Ritchie de Laet.

Neil Warnock was proud of his Crystal Palace teams performance as they beat Leicester City 2-0 at Selhurst Park. That proved to be the last action of note in a 45 minutes that will not live long in the memory - especially as the game burst to life at the start of the second half. David Nugent came agonisingly close to breaking the deadlock early after the restart but his shot came off the legs of Joel Ward and behind for a corner. Leonardo Ulloa had been unusually quiet but he came close with a header from Cambiasso's near-post cross, with fellow Argentinian Speroni doing just enough to prevent him scoring a sixth of the campaign.

Palace also started the second half brighter and were ahead moments later as Puncheon's deep corner was headed towards goal by Scott Dann, with Campbell scrambling it past Schemiechel from close range. The Foxes were left bewildered from the very next Puncheon set-piece as Palace skipper Jedinak this time powered home a free-kick from the left-hand side of the box to double the hosts' advantage. Pearson's side prospered in catching United's defence short on the counter-attack but Vardy, the man of the match against the Red Devils, was guilty of losing possession when a ball to Nugent would have set the one-time England international through on goal. Ulloa saw a late effort bravely blocked by Damien Delaney but overall the alterations did not bring about a change in fortunes for Leicester, who suffered just their second league defeat of the season and fall behind Palace in the table as a result."},{"date": "27/09/2015", "arena": "KCOM Stadium", "attendance": 22859, "home_team": {"name": "Hull City", "lineup": [{"name": "Allan McGregor",

Early goals from Sergio Aguero and Dzeko put the visitors in front before Hull responded before half-time, only for Dzeko and Frank Lampard to earn their side the points in the second period. The champions took the lead on seven minutes when Aguero took advantage of some slack home defending to angle a drive beyond Allan McGregor. Just four minutes later, it was 2-0 when David Silva fed Dzeko and the Bosnian striker curled a thumping shot from the edge of the area over McGregor. Best of the Match: Man of the match: Edin Dzeko coming through for his side with two well-taken goals. Goal of the match: Dzeko's first as he collected Silva's pass before curling a fierce effort into the top corner. Save of the match: Allan McGregor's reflex save from a tight angle with just seconds on the clock after Sergio Aguero had sprinted clear of the defence. Attempt of the match: Yaya Toure with a scorching effort from distance which just swerved onto the post at the last. Moment of the match: Abel Hernandez drawing Hull level after Eliaquim Mangala's inexplicable challenge in the box. Talking point: Eliaquim Mangala's torrid ten-minute spell where he conceded an own-goal and gave away a penalty. But Hull were helped back into the game on 21 minutes when Liam Rosenior powered down the right and his cross was headed into his own net by Eliaquim Mangala. The summer signing from Porto then gave the home side the chance to equalise on 32 minutes when his high boot caught Abel Hernandez and the Hull striker converted the penalty. Yaya Toure crashed a long-distance drive against the post early in the second half before the visitors regained the lead on 68 minutes when Dzeko rolled a low shot past McGregor. Manuel Pellegrini’s side put the game to bed with three minutes to go when substitute Lampard was presented with a simple finish from Pablo Zabaleta’s pull-back. The game began at a furious pace, Aguero charging at goal and testing McGregor at the near post with just 40 seconds on the clock. Hull wasted little time making inroads of their own, Jake Livermore sending a devilish cross into the six-yard box where Nikica Jelavic just failed to make contact having slipped between Vincent Kompany and Mangala. It took just seven minutes for the opener to arrive, Hull having twice failed to get the ball clear. Pablo Zabaleta battled hard to head back into the danger zone and Aguero needed just one touch to shoot across McGregor and into the corner. Four minutes later Dzeko lashed in the second, collecting Silva's pass and turning Rosenior before expertly finding the top corner. Although early, it looked to be game over, as minds immediately turned to the visitors' 7-0 thrashing of Sheffield Wednesday and whether it could be repeated. But Hull's response was emphatic. Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini told Sky Sports he thought that City's 4-2 win away at Hull was a very important win for his side. Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini told Sky Sports he thought that City's 4-2 win away at Hull was a very important win for his side. Gael Clichy, notionally supported by Silva, was an obvious target and was exposed as the hosts hit back in the 21st minute. Ahmed Elmohamady linked well with Rosenior before the latter breezed past Clichy and crossed from the right. There were plenty of blue shirts on hand but the first, Mangala, lost his bearings completely as he sent an unstoppable header arrowing into his own net. Aguero nearly dampened the celebrations when he went straight up the pitch and slotted an inch or two wide on the counter but Hull were not finished either.

The reward came in the 32nd minute, Diame chipping to Hernandez only for the striker to be taken out by Mangala's wild high-footed challenge. The Uruguayan sent Willy Caballero, who had been selected ahead of Joe Hart, the wrong way and the champions were glad to hear the half-time whistle. But the balance shifted again soon after the restart, Toure clattering the post from long distance. Pellegrini's men were back on the front foot, Silva re-emerging after a quiet period and Aguero always nagging. But with the scores still tied the ineffective Fernandinho gave way for Jesus Navas for the last 25 minutes. It was a risky switch that left Manchester City light on ball-winners but they regained the lead in a matter of minutes.

Edin Dzeko scored twice in Manchester City's win over Hull City, but admits it was a tough game for the Champions. Silva was the driver, cutting inside and riding Diame's challenge before freeing Dzeko on the left. The striker finished clinically, sliding his shot past the outstretched McGregor and in at the far post. Hull had not given up, Gaston Ramirez working Caballero after stepping off the bench alongside Hatem Ben Arfa, and Tom Huddlestone seeing his 20-yard drive loop up off Kompany and over the crossbar. But there was just enough time for Lampard to score his fourth goal in three games, arriving with a typical late run to convert Zabaleta's cut-back."},{"date": "27/09/2015", "arena": "Old Trafford", "attendance": 75317, "home_team": {"name": "Manchester United", "lineup": [{"name": "David De Gea", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rafael", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paddy McNair", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marcos Rojo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Luke Shaw", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daley Blind", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ander Herrera", "yellows": [48], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [74]}, {"name": "Ángel di María", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Wayne Rooney", "yellows": [], "reds": [59], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robin van Persie", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Falcao", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [65]}], "subs": [{"name": "Juan Mata", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adnan Januzaj", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Anders Lindegaard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Darren Fletcher", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [65], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Antonio Valencia", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [74], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Thorpe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andreas Pereira", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "West Ham United", "lineup": [{"name": "Adrián", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Guy Demel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [65]}, {"name": "James Tomkins", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Winston Reid", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Cresswell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex Song", "yellows": [3], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Diego Poyet", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [75]}, {"name": "Diafra Sakho", "yellows": [72], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stewart Downing", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Morgan Amalfitano", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [61]}, {"name": "Enner Valencia", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Kevin Nolan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [75], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mauro Zárate", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ricardo Vaz Te", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Carl Jenkinson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [65], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Collins", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jussi Jaaskelainen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Carlton Cole", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [61], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Manchester United survived Wayne Rooney’s moment of madness as their captain scored and was then sent off in the 2-1 victory over West Ham at Old Trafford. Rooney was red carded just before the hour mark after a rush of blood saw him kick out at Stewart Downing, but Louis van Gaal’s men held out with teenage defender Paddy McNair impressing on his debut for the club alongside Marcos Rojo. Best of the match Man of the match: Paddy McNair. The teenage defender was making his Manchester United debut but looked composed in the first half and stood firm in the second. Goal of the match: Wayne Rooney’s opener was a sublime first-time finish, guiding Rafael’s cross beyond Adrian with a very deft touch that used the pace of the cross to beat the keeper. Moment of the match: Rooney’s second half red card was totally unnecessary and put his side on the back foot for the remainder of the game. Controversy of the match: Kevin Nolan thought he had levelled when he turned home Carl Jenkinson’s cross late on, but the flag had gone up for offside. A very close call. Rooney had opened the scoring with just five minutes on the clock, applying a superb first-time finish to Rafael’s run and cross down the right to guide the ball across Adrian and into the back of the net. United made it 2-0 midway through the half, Robin van Persie feinting past Winston Reid before shooting low across goal into the bottom corner from Radamel Falcao’s pass after Alex Song had been robbed of possession in his own half. But the home side’s frailties returned to haunt them once again as David de Gea came and missed Downing’s corner, allowing Enner Valencia to head against the bar and Diafra Sakho nodded home the rebound. The home side were sluggish at the start of the second period and were left clinging on after Rooney was rightly dismissed by referee Lee Mason, with McNair producing one excellent defensive header and Kevin Nolan seeing an effort ruled out for offside. Rooney’s red card is set to rule the United skipper out of the forthcoming games against Everton, West Brom and Chelsea - three games United will want to win to put themselves firmly back in the hunt for the Champions League places. The desire to put last week's capitulation at Leicester to bed was clear from the first whistle as United hit West Ham with attack after attack, and it took less than five minutes for the hosts to break the deadlock. Manchester United bounced back from last weekend's heavy defeat to Leicester with victory over West Ham Manchester United bounced back from last weekend's heavy defeat to Leicester with victory over West Ham Rafael sprinted down the right flank after dinking the ball over Aaron Cresswell. The Brazilian paused and crossed for Rooney, who fired past Adrian after one bounce. The expert execution across the West Ham goalkeeper was befitting of a striker whose Premier League scoring record is now only bettered by Andy Cole and Alan Shearer. United's creaky defence almost cost them the lead within one minute of Rooney's goal. Daley Blind's miscued clearance landed straight into the stride of Valencia, but he blasted into the Stretford End. It was a let-off for the hosts, who quickly sought to settle the nervy home crowd with a second goal. Rooney found Van Persie at the back post with a delightful cross, but the Dutchman headed wide. Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal told Sky Sports he accepts Wayne Rooney's red card in his side's 2-1 win over West Ham. Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal told Sky Sports he accepts Wayne Rooney's red card in his side's 2-1 win over West Ham. Angel di Maria shot high and wide from inside the West Ham box and Rooney then fluffed a shot inside the area, but Van Persie had no such trouble in the 22nd minute when he put United 2-0 up. Ander Herrera nicked the ball off Barcelona loanee Song and Van Persie angled his shot past West Ham goalkeeper Adrian after a clever pass from Falcao. For all their attacking brilliance, at the back United still looked suspect. Song slipped Sakho in behind, but Rojo raced across to put in a vital tackle. Sakho found the net a few minutes later due to a rare error from De Gea. Valencia hit the bar with a header after the Spaniard flapped at a corner and the ball fell to Sakho, who headed into an empty net.

West Ham manager Sam Allardyce believes his side were denied a point after Kevin Nolan's goal was ruled offside in their loss to Manchester United. After the break, West Ham continued to press and aside from a shot by Falcao, United offered little on the attack. Slack marking from debutant Luke Shaw allowed Sakho to sting De Gea's palms with a fierce volley. United looked shaky in the face of West Ham's attacking play, and their task was made much harder when Rooney was sent off just before the hour. The United captain, unable to catch Downing, needlessly kicked the midfielder from behind while he was at full pace, earning his first red card for United in five-and-a-half years. Van Gaal looked to shore up his team by bringing Darren Fletcher on for Falcao after West Ham sent Carlton Cole on and looked to press home their numerical advantage.

Graziano Pelle's superb goal gave Southampton a sixth straight win in all competitions as they saw off visitors QPR 2-1. The victory for Ronald Koeman's men makes it four in a row in the Premier League and follows on from the midweek success at Arsenal which took Saints into the Capital One Cup fourth round. All the goals at St Mary's on Saturday came in the second half. On-loan Chelsea left-back Ryan Bertrand opened the scoring in the 54th minute with a fine finish after Sadio Mane's backheel. Best of the match Man of the match: Sadio Mane enjoyed an impressive Premier League debut, setting up Ryan Bertrand's opener with a crafty backheel. Was wrongly flagged offside at least once and played several key passes. Goal of the match: Graziano Pelle's acrobatic overhead winner from Dusan Tadic's header down was the pick as the second-half goals got better and better. Moment of the match: Nico Kranjcar was so close to equalising for QPR at 2-1 down with a magnificent free-kick that clipped the underside of Fraser Forster's crossbar and then bounced out. Talking point: Next up for Saints - a trip to Mauricio Pochettino's Tottenham. Can they keep their fine run going against their former coach's new club? Rangers hit back through Charlie Austin's excellent swivel and shot on 66 minutes, but just two minutes later, Pelle came up with an acrobatic winner after being set up by Dusan Tadic's header. The win keeps Saints in second spot, three points behind leaders Chelsea after six games, while QPR remain 18th in the table. Both teams made two changes. Toby Alderweireld was back for Saints after a hamstring strain and Bertrand also returned to the defence, with teenager Matt Targett dropping to the bench and Florian Gardos missing out through injury. Pelle's post-match reaction Pelle's post-match reaction Sandro was back from a knee injury for QPR, and Matty Phillips started on the right after being a first-half substitute a week ago in the 2-2 draw at home to Stoke. The man he replaced, Joey Barton, dropped out along with Jordon Mutch - both picked up hamstring injuries a week ago. Visiting manager Harry Redknapp received the hate-filled welcome he anticipated, after quitting Saints for bitter rivals Portsmouth in 2005. The ex-Tottenham boss was subjected to vitriolic chanting from home supporters from the moment he emerged. Bertrand: Mobbed after opening scoring Tadic spent the first half gamely battling to cajole Southampton's staccato attack into something resembling fluency. Despite his best efforts however, the hosts were unable to break the deadlock before the break, even with QPR remaining largely toothless up front. Morgan Schneiderlin squandered the chance of the half, screwing his low shot well wide after being sent clean through by Mane. Serbia forward Tadic wasted a gilt-edged chance himself, unable to connect cleanly enough in the box to provide the power to beat Rob Green. Redknapp: We showed character Redknapp: We showed character The relieved Rangers keeper tapped wide at full stretch when Tadic should have buried his point-blank effort. None of Saints' big men were able to meet Tadic's early whipped free-kick with any accuracy early on and that missed opportunity set a frustrating tone for the opening exchanges. Pelle fired wide of Green's left post when he could have aimed across goal too, as Saints continued their wasteful half. Eduardo Vargas and Austin spent precious little time combining with their midfield to offer any tangible threat for Rangers, but Niko Kranjcar and Leroy Fer had to shoulder their share of blame for not bridging the divide. Koeman praises Pelle Koeman praises Pelle Phillips blasted high and wide after a botched clearance from Nathaniel Clyne, before Austin chipped wide in first-half stoppage time. Redknapp's men were fortunate to turn around on level terms, desperately hoping to grow in stature with every chance Saints fluffed. Just when the visitors thought they could frustrate Southampton into a costly error though, Koeman's men opened the scoring. Mane's prescient backheel opened the QPR defence, Bertrand raced through the door and blasted the ball under Green to wrestle control for Saints in the 54th minute. Austin: Equalised for QPR Austin disabused any Saints notions of coasting to victory with a fine finish 12 minutes later, firing home on the spin after controlling Vargas' cross. Rangers' return to level terms was meant to stun Saints into a state of shock, but instead the hosts struck straight back. A peripheral figure for much of the afternoon, Pelle forced the game to turn on his acrobatic finish. The Italian striker teed himself up before unleashing an unstoppable scissor-kick blast into the top corner to put Saints 2-1 to the good only two minutes after the visitors had levelled. Austin left disappointed Austin left disappointed Steven Davis rattled the woodwork from 20 yards as Saints pressed again, before Austin headed wide in another fine opportunity for QPR. Kranjcar hit the angle of post and bar for QPR as Redknapp's men ground on in search of a second equaliser. Tadic struck a post as the match edged into stoppage time, but Saints eased to victory despite failing to add a third goal. They travel to face former coach Mauricio Pochettino's Tottenham on Sunday week, a match that immediately precedes QPR's next assignment at West Ham."},{"date": "27/09/2015", "arena": "Stadium of

Stadium of Light Billy Jones: Comes close for Sunderland in the 0-0 draw with Swansea Sunderland’s wait for a first Premier League win of the season continued as they were held to a 0-0 draw with 10-man Swansea at the Stadium of Light. Sunderland enjoyed the better of the chances in a goalless first half as Lukasz Fabianski needed to be alert to deny Adam Johnson and Santiago Vergini with smart saves, while Swansea were mainly limited to efforts from range. Swansea did test Vito Mannone after the break through Gylfi Sigurdsson’s strike, but Connor Wickham passed up the best opportunity for the hosts as he headed Sebastian Larsson’s cross over the bar from inside the area. The Swans had full-back Angel Rangel dismissed with 10 minutes remaining after he was shown a second yellow card for blocking Will Buckley, while substitute Steven Fletcher nodded a glaring chance wide in the closing stages for the hosts. Best of the Match: Man of the Match: Will Buckley was a constant threat for Sunderland, linking up well with Billy Jones down the right and giving Swansea left-back Neil Taylor a busy afternoon.

Connor Wickham should really have given Sunderland the lead as he was found unmarked by Sebastian Larsson inside the area, only to head the cross wide. Moment of the Match: Angel Rangel’s dismissal with 10 minutes remaining on the clock was the signal for Sunderland to throw everything forward, but Gus Poyet’s men were still unable to find an opening. Sunderland head coach Gus Poyet had expressed his admiration for the Welsh side's approach and predicted a difficult afternoon for his players. But his tactical plan, designed to frustrate the visitors, worked well in the opening 45 minutes and Garry Monk's men could not muster a single attempt on target despite enjoying sustained periods of possession. Indeed, it was the Black Cats who created all the better chances in the first half, forcing Fabianski to earn his money with a series of important saves. Johnson was first to call upon the Poland international when he met Wickham's 12th-minute flick-on beyond the far post and drilled in a half-volley from a tight angle which Fabianski did well to turn away. The keeper had to sprint from his line four minutes later to prevent Buckley from latching on to Larsson's through-ball with Sunderland finding their stride. Swansea were prospering out wide with Nathan Dyer and Wayne Routledge seeing plenty of the ball as Jonjo Shelvey and Sigurdsson kept the supply lines open. But they were able to create little of note with Dyer twice failing to come anywhere near hitting the target after working himself into promising positions. By contrast, Sigurdsson had to get in an important 35th-minute block to repel Lee Cattermole's well-struck volley, and Fabianski was very nearly caught out by Vergini's looping header seconds later, eventually throwing out a hand to turn it away at the last minute. Swans striker Bafetimbi Gomis fired tamely high and wide five minutes before the break after turning marker John O'Shea, but Sunderland keeper Mannone headed for the dressing room having not had a save to make. Gus Poyet feels Sunderland did all they could do to win against Swansea Gus Poyet feels Sunderland did all they could do to win against Swansea Ki Sung-yueng blazed high over the bar four minutes after the restart with the Welsh side increasing their tempo, and there was an anxious moment for Vergini seconds later when he stuck out a leg as Routledge went past him into the box and went to ground, although referee Chris Foy was unmoved. Mannone was called upon for the first time with 57 minutes gone to keep out Sigurdsson's dipping effort from distance, but did so with little discomfort. The game became increasingly physical as it wore on with Ashley Williams and Wickham in particular becoming embroiled in a wrestling match. Poyet looked to inject fresh impetus by replacing Johnson with Ricky Alvarez with 24 minutes remaining, and the Argentinian had an immediate impact as he targeted full-back Neil Taylor and covering midfielder Routledge. Garry Monk says Swansea City got a deserved point away to Sunderland Garry Monk says Swansea City got a deserved point away to Sunderland It was the Black Cats' turn to look in vain to Mr Foy after Wickham appeared to be dragged to the ground inside the box by central defender Federico Fernandez with 68 minutes gone with time fast running out. They came agonisingly close to snatching the lead three minutes later when Buckley slipped past Fernandez and drove the ball across goal, where Taylor did just enough to prevent Wickham making contact in front of a gaping goal. But the former Ipswich striker was guilty of a glaring 74th-minute miss when he met Larsson's cross unopposed, but powered his header harmlessly over the bar. With Rangel having departed after bring down Buckley to earn his second yellow card, Fabianski plucked Larsson's 83rd-minute free-kick from under his crossbar and Fletcher headed a cross from the impressive Alvarez just wide seconds later as the visitors stood firm."},{"date": "27/09/2015", "arena": "Emirates Stadium", "attendance": 59900, "home_team": {"name": "Arsenal", "lineup": [{"name":

Best of the match Man of the match: Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. He produced a dynamic display for Arsenal and clinched the draw with a well-taken finish from close range. Goal of the match: Nacer Chadli broke the deadlock with a calm finish past Wojciech Szczesny after Christian Eriksen and Erik Lamela had combined to release him. Moment of the match: Chadli’s goal gave Tottenham something to protect but an Arsenal onslaught was finally rewarded when Oxlade-Chanberlain scored. Save of the match: Hugo Lloris pulled off a superb stop to claw the ball off his line after it had travelled quickly towards goal from a combination of Per Mertesacker and Emmanuel Adebayor. Talking point: Where does the balance of power lie in North London following this game? Arsenal responded strongly as Oxlade-Chamberlain fired in a leveller from close range after 74 minutes, but neither side could find a winner in a gripping finale. It was Arsenal who pushed forward during the closing stages but Spurs - inspired by a stand-out performance from captain Younes Kaboul - held out for a share of the points. Arsenal had also made a bright start, with Ramsey and Mesut Ozil interchanging between the number 10 role behind Danny Welbeck. England forward Welbeck, the £16million deadline day signing from Manchester United, showed Jan Vertonghen a clean pair of heels with a clever flick on the half-way line and sped to the edge of the penalty area, where, in a sign of what was to come, Kaboul darted across to block. On 24 minutes, Spurs goalkeeper Hugo Lloris had to be alert as Oxlade-Chamberlain's deflected cross from the right was looping under the crossbar before it was tipped away by the France international. Lloris was then grateful a 20-yard drive from Jack Wilshere was straight at him following more patient build up by Arsenal and a lay off from Welbeck. Arsenal had to make a change on 28 minutes when captain Arteta pulled up with what looked like a calf injury, and was replaced by Mathieu Flamini, fit again after a dead leg. Wenger extremely frustrated Wenger extremely frustrated Wilshere then turned his ankle when pressing into the Spurs penalty area, where he looked to be tripped by Danny Rose, but after limping off for treatment was able to play on. When Spurs did hit on the counter, a deep ball from right-back Kyle Naughton dropped through to Emmanuel Adebayor at the far post, but the former Arsenal striker hesitated and was closed down. As Per Mertesacker jumped with Vertonghen at a Spurs corner, the big German headed the ball goalwards, which Arsenal goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny did well to hold at close range. Pochettino praises Spurs Pochettino praises Spurs Lloris got down quickly to deflect away a low, curling effort from Oxlade-Chamberlain after Ramsey had run across the edge of the Tottenham penalty area. The Wales midfielder was, though, soon on the floor clutching his hamstring as Arsenal were forced into another change just before the interval with Santi Cazorla coming on. Arsenal started the second half in determined mood, as Kaboul had to block an angled drive from Cazorla after good work from Wilshere, who seemed to have run off his knock. Mason: A dream week Mason: A dream week Lloris then made a smart save after Ozil was played into the right side of the Spurs penalty area. It was Spurs, though, who took the lead against the run of play on 56 minutes. Christian Eriksen robbed Flamini in midfield, and fed Erik Lamela who in turn played Chadli clear on the right side of the penalty area and he slotted the ball under Szczesny. Arsenal's fight for places Arsenal's fight for places Arsenal looked for an immediate response and almost got one as Mertesacker's downward header from a free-kick was clawed off the line by Lloris. Wilshere was replaced by Alexis Sanchez, the £32million Chile forward sent on to inject some life into the Arsenal attack for the closing 25 minutes. Referee Michael Oliver needed to keep check on some hefty challenges coming in from Spurs, with midfielder Ryan Mason, making his Premier League debut, the third player booked in the space of a few minutes for clattering Ozil.

The Premier League newcomers found themselves 2-0 down with Robin van Persie and a world class finish from Angel Di Maria, who scored a stunning chip over Kasper Schmeichel. But, however impressive United's Galacticos are on the attack, the fact remains this squad is woefully sub-standard at the back and Leicester took full advantage to record their first home victory over the 20-time champions since 1985. Best of the match: Man of the match: Jamie Vardy - The Leicester striker, who made the climb from non-league to Premier League, was a handful all game. Goal of the match: Angel di Maria scored an early contender for goal of the season with a quite stunning chip over Kasper Schmeichel. Moment of the match: Leonardo Ulloa tucked away Leicester's fifth to send the King Power Stadium into delirium. Talking point: Should United boss Louis van Gaal have spent some of his huge summer outlay on a defender? Stat of the match: For the first time in their 853-game Premier League history, United threw away a two-goal lead to lose. Leonardo Ulloa pulled one back before Ander Herrera's restored United two-goal cushion, but David Nugent scored from the spot after a needless foul by Rafael on Jamie Vardy. Esteban Cambiasso restored parity with a goal on his full debut to send the home fans into delirium. Incredibly, Vardy handed the Foxes the lead 11 minutes from time and then United's day got worse when Tyler Blackett was sent off for bringing down the dangerous Vardy in the box. Ulloa stepped up to convert for his fifth goal of the season to lift Nigel Pearson's side into sixth spot. The defeat brought Louis Van Gaal back down to earth following his first victory against QPR last week. Much work clearly has to be done if he is to achieve his target of a top-three finish. Jonny Evans denied Ulloa twice early on, first with a clever header and then with a fine block, which clearly hurt the centre-back. It did not take long for Di Maria to start causing trouble at the other end though. The former Real Madrid man drove at the Leicester defence and slotted Van Persie in behind, but Schmeichel ran out and blocked the Dutchman's shot. United were now in full flow. They looked particularly venomous down the left, where Marcos Rojo and Di Maria were proving far too quick for Ritchie De Laet. The former United right-back dived in and allowed full debutant Radamel Falcao, who started ahead of Juan Mata, to turn the ball past him in the 12th minute. The Colombian paused and chipped a pin-point cross to Van Persie, whose header flew past Schmeichel off Liam Moore. Just three minutes later, Di Maria doubled the lead with an early contender for goal of the season. The Argentine sprinted from inside his own half and picked a return ball up off Wayne Rooney before he scooped the ball over Schmeichel with his left boot. Van Gaal rose to his feet to commend the £59.7million signing. Nigel Pearson praised his side's spirit and character Nigel Pearson praised his side's spirit and character Just 72 seconds later the United boss was cursing his defence as they allowed Leicester back into the game. Vardy got to the byline and whipped in a flat ball to the back post where Ulloa powered a header past David De Gea. United suffered a couple of injury problems before the break. Evans, still struggling after blocking Ulloa's early shot, hobbled off and was replaced by Chris Smalling. Di Maria also needed his wrist strapped after he was brushed off the ball by De Laet. There was no sign of the impending meltdown in the rest of the first half. Smalling, Daley Blind and Blackett all looked sturdy at the back. United should have had their third just before the break when Rojo headed over from four yards. Within three minutes of the restart Falcao had rattled the bar with a fine volley. Herrera went one better in the 57th minute, as he turned the ball in to make it 3-1. The Spaniard cleverly flicked Rooney's goal-bound shot past Schmeichel from six yards after Rafael caused havoc in the box with a wicked low cross Louis van Gaal was in disbelief at individual errors which cost his side Louis van Gaal was in disbelief at individual errors which cost his side The Brazilian quickly went from hero to villain though as he gave away a contentious penalty at the other end. Vardy barged Rafael off the ball down Leicester's left and the defender lost his cool, nudging over the forward in the box. Mark Clattenburg ignored United's protestations and pointed to the spot. Nugent blasted the ball down the middle past De Gea to score. Within two minutes, United's defence went to pieces again and Leicester equalised. Dean Hammond, given plenty of space on the edge of the box, saw his shot blocked in the centre of the area where Cambiasso pounced, stabbing the ball past De Gea. Van Gaal slumped further into his seat with 12 minutes left when Leicester, amazingly, took the lead. De Laet nicked the ball off Mata, who had just come on for Di Maria, and cantered down the left back before finding the unmarked Vardy, who calmly beat De Gea. Yet more shocking defending was to come from the visitors. Vardy easily nudged Blackett aside and raced towards the box, only to be brought down by the young centre-half with an awful tackle from behind. Mark Clattenburg had no option but to send Blackett off. Ulloa beat De Gea from 12 yards to seal Leicester's fairytale victory."},{"date": "21/09/2015", "arena": "White Hart Lane", "attendance": 35861, "home_team": {"name": "Tottenham Hotspur", "lineup": [{"name": "Hugo Lloris", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eric Dier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Younes Kaboul", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Vlad Chiriches", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Rose", "yellows": [73], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Etienne Capoue", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [76]}, {"name": "Mousa Dembélé", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [61]}, {"name": "Erik Lamela", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Eriksen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nacer Chadli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [61]}, {"name": "Emmanuel Adebayor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Jan Vertonghen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Lennon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [76], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paulinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [61], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Roberto Soldado", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [61], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michel Vorm", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Naughton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nabil Bentaleb", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "West Bromwich Albion", "lineup": [{"name": "Ben Foster", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andre Wisdom", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Craig Dawson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joleon Lescott", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sébastien Pocognoli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Morrison", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Craig Gardner", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Graham Dorrans", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stéphane Sessegnon", "yellows": [83], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Chris Brunt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Saido Berahino", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Chris Baird", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Brown Ideye", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Anichebe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Boaz Myhill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cristian Gamboa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Youssouf Mulumbu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gareth McAuley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "James Morrison: Celebrates West Brom's winner at Tottenham A second-half header from James Morrison secured West Brom’s first win of the season as they beat Tottenham 1-0 at White Hart Lane.

Hugo Lloris had to be alert to parry Craig Gardner’s well-struck effort after a short-corner routine ended with a 25-yarder powered through a crowd of players. Moment of the match: The whole Spurs defence dozed off at a corner to allow one of the smallest men on the pitch to head home the only goal of the game unmarked inside the six-yard box. West Brom should have had a first-half penalty when Emmanuel Adebayor handled a Dawson header, but they continued to press after the break in a display that belied their lowly standing. A header from Morrison, left unmarked at a corner by Erik Lamela, in the 74th minute proved the difference, condemning Spurs to back-to-back home defeats in the league for the first time since November 2012. This was a match for which Mauricio Pochettino reverted to his starting line-up from the 2-2 draw at Sunderland after Thursday's trip to Partizan Belgrade in the Europa League. That meant a recall for Younes Kaboul and Vlad Chiriches - a centre-back partnership that looked shaky from the very start, highlighted by early Dawson and Saido Berahino efforts. West Brom came closer still in the 11th minute after foolish, over-complicated play from Chiriches saw him concede a corner. While the first set-piece was cleared, the following cross fell to debutant Lescott, whose powerful strike was heading in until team-mate Dawson accidentally blocked. It was a huge let-off for the hosts and, in particular, the Romanian, while Hugo Lloris came to the rescue when Craig Gardner was afforded space to strike a low, goalbound effort from the edge of the box. Pochettino's men were playing terribly and all they appeared to have going for them was luck, with referee Kevin Friend missing Adebayor clearly handling Dawson's header in the 31st minute. West Brom celebrations were cut short soon after when the offside flag resulted in a close-range Berahino strike being chalked off, while at the other end Lescott was doing well to frustrate former Manchester City team-mate Adebayor. Mauricio Pochettino is dissapointed with his side's energyless performance which led to their 1-0 loss against West Brom. Mauricio Pochettino is dissapointed with his side's energyless performance which led to their 1-0 loss against West Brom. Lescott stopped him latching onto balls from Danny Rose and Christian Eriksen, with Adebayor failing to meet a cross from the latter on the one occasion he found space in the box. An off-target Kaboul header was the only shot Spurs could muster by half-time, from which they returned seemingly rejuvenated as Eric Dier and Nacer Chadli had chances in quick succession. However, Pochettino's men were not on the front foot for long as Gardner sliced a half-volley wide before Berahino all too easily cut inside Chiriches to sting the palms of Lloris and Kaboul hacked clear. Paulinho and Roberto Soldado were introduced with 30 minutes remaining in a bid to change the game, with the latter denied by a brave Ben Foster save after the Baggies goalkeeper fumbled an Eriksen cross under pressure. A relieved Alan Irvine was happy to hear the final-whistle and is delighted for his squad after achieving their first win under his reign. A relieved Alan Irvine was happy to hear the final-whistle and is delighted for his squad after achieving their first win under his reign. The England international denied Soldado again soon after, but West Brom were still enjoying too much possession for Spurs' liking. Lloris gathered a 20-yard strike from Morrison as Irvine's men pushed forwards, with the Scotland international finally beating the Tottenham goalkeeper in the 74th minute. Lamela was guilty of losing the midfielder from a Chris Brunt corner, allowing him to head home with ease. It was a gut punch Spurs were unable to recover from, with a wayward, acrobatic effort from Paulinho the best they could muster as West Brom held out for an impressive win."},{"date": "21/09/2015", "arena": "Goodison Park", "attendance": 37574, "home_team": {"name": "Everton", "lineup": [{"name": "Tim Howard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Stones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [64]}, {"name": "Phil Jagielka", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sylvain Distin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [84]}, {"name": "Leighton Baines", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James McCarthy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gareth Barry", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leon Osman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Atsu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [64]}, {"name": "Romelu Lukaku", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Samuel Eto'o", "yellows": [56], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Joel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Darron Gibson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [84], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aiden McGeady", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin Mirallas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [64], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Naismith", "yellows": [77], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [64], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Muhamed Besic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Antolin Alcaraz", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Crystal Palace", "lineup": [{"name": "Julian Speroni", "yellows": [89], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Kelly", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Scott Dann", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Damien Delaney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joel Ward", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James McArthur", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [84]}, {"name": "Mile Jedinak", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jason Puncheon", "yellows": [76], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Ledley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yannick Bolasie", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [87]}, {"name": "Fraizer Campbell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [86]}], "subs": [{"name": "Adrian Mariappa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adlene Guedioura", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [84], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin Doyle", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [86], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wilfried Zaha", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wayne Hennessey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dwight Gayle", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Zeki Fryers", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [87], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Crystal Palace came from behind to beat Everton 3-2 at Goodison Park and pick up their first win of the Premier League campaign.

Palace barely surfaced in the first half hour but moments after Osman had shot straight at Speroni they seized their chance to draw level when Howard fouled McArthur in the box and referee Michael Oliver pointed to the spot. Jedinak stepped up to fire the ball confidently past Howard and give Warnock's men a sudden foot-hold in the game that had earlier threatened to pass them by. The goal swung the momentum in Palace's direction and they almost seized the lead five minutes before the break when Bolasie's deflected effort struck Howard's crossbar.

After a well fought comeback from Crystal Palace, Roberto Martinez believes his team should have defended better and is disappointed with the shock defeat. Palace kept pushing at the start of the second half and they went ahead on 54 minutes when Howard flapped terribly at Kelly's cross from the right allowing Campbell to get just enough power on the ball to flop it over the line. Lukaku and Gareth Barry missed chances to draw level but it got worse for the hosts in the 69th minute when Puncheon nicked the ball off Osman and played a perfect low ball to the unmarked Bolasie to stroke home. Substitute Steven Naismith missed a chance to immediately reduce the deficit as he failed to get the vital touch to a Kevin Mirallas cross, then Dann made a vital interception to deny Lukaku and an Osman effort through a crowd of players was saved by the unsighted Speroni. Baines set up a frantic finale when he swept home a penalty seven minutes from time after Dann had brought down McCarthy in the box. Jagielka dribbled an effort inches wide and Lukaku scythed an 88th-minute effort across the face of goal as Palace waded through six minutes of injury time to secure the points."},{"date":

stepped off the substitutes’ bench to score against his former club and salvage a 1-1 draw for Manchester City at home to Chelsea. The eagerly-awaited showdown at the Etihad Stadium provided few clear chances as defences dominated, but it sprang to life in the second half after Pablo Zabaleta was red carded for a second bookable offence in the 66th minute. Best of the match Man of the match: James Milner. He impressed with his quality as well as his work-rate and produced a fabulous pass to set up Frank Lampard. Goal of the match: The moment of the match came in the 85th minute as Milner raced on to a good pass from deep and turned a cross back into the centre on the volley, giving Lampard the chance to equalise against his former club with the sort of classy finish that Chelsea fans became accustomed to during his time with them. Save of the match: Thibaut Courtois pulled off a decent stop to deny Sergio Aguero and was then helped out when Ramires reacted quickest to the rebound to get the ball clear. Talking point: Were Chelsea right to let Lampard go? What does this game tell us about the title race? Andre Schurrle tapped in an Eden Hazard cross five minutes later to set Chelsea on course for a fifth successive Premier League win, but they were denied by Lampard. The midfielder steered an excellent finish into the bottom corner from James Milner’s pass and, although he did not celebrate, his team-mates and fans were jubilant as City stayed within five points of the leaders. City gave a debut to Eliaquim Mangala, their £32million signing from Porto brought in to add greater depth at centre-back, but his job was made much easier playing alongside his irrepressible captain Vincent Kompany. Diego Costa, over whom fitness doubts still persist after he was rested for the midweek Champions League draw with Schalke, arrived at the Etihad Stadium as the Premier League's hottest striker with seven goals in four matches. But with the greatest respect to the likes of Everton's Phil Jagielka, Swansea's Ashley Williams, Leicester's Wes Morgan or Burnley's Michael Duff, the Spain international found himself facing a whole different class of opponent. As City dominated possession and territory it took until midway through the first half for their first real one-to-one but with Costa looking to drive into the left of the penalty area he was comfortably muscled off the ball by Kompany. Aside from an optimistic handball shout against Yaya Youre from Cesc Fabregas's free-kick it was the closest Chelsea came to threatening. Frank Lampard came off the bench to rescue a point for Manchester City against his former club Chelsea. Frank Lampard came off the bench to rescue a point for Manchester City against his former club Chelsea. In fact Costa's most significant first-half intervention saw him tangle with Edin Dzeko which could have resulted in a penalty but only led to a corner, which was easily repelled. It was virtually one-way traffic in the first 45 minutes as Dzeko and Toure both failed to convert early headers, setting a dismal precedent for some mediocre set-piece play from City. With Milner enjoying a bright start down the right-hand side City stroked the ball about confidently but found, like in their 1-0 home defeat by Chelsea last season, they were smothered as soon as they got within 10 yards of the penalty area. Jose Mourniho believes a point against Manchester City, despite conceding late on, is ultimately a good result for his Chelsea side. Jose Mourniho believes a point against Manchester City, despite conceding late on, is ultimately a good result for his Chelsea side. Fernandinho sliced wide from outside area and Sergio Aguero, whom had earlier been left in a heap when John Terry went through the back of him unnoticed by referee Mike Dean, hooked over. Toure almost unlocked Chelsea's watertight defence from a looping ball with outside of his right foot but it dropped agonisingly out of Aguero's reach. City's pressure continued after the break as Fernandinho blazed wide and Aguero forced Thibaut Courtois to fumble a snap-shot before the advantage swung in Chelsea's favour with Zabaleta's dismissal. Manuel Pellegrini wasn't happy with a draw, despite his side leaving it late to equalise against title rivals Chelsea.. Manuel Pellegrini wasn't happy with a draw, despite his side leaving it late to equalise against title rivals Chelsea.. Having already been booked for a first-half foul on Eden Hazard the Argentinian rashly dived in at Costa and the Chelsea striker reacted aggressively and Dean showed both yellow cards - which meant a premature departure for the City defender. Manuel Pellegrini had no option but to shore up the right-back spot by sacrificing Aguero for Bacary Sagna but having got City where they wanted them, Chelsea applied what appeared to be the finishing blow as Hazard curled an inviting, low, cross to the far post where Schurrle tapped home. Costa had chances to put the game beyond City with a header straight at Joe Hart and then shooting against the post before Lampard, of all people, made him and his former employers pay. He made a special effort to applaud the Chelsea fans at the final whistle but their club idol may have lost a little of his sheen in their eyes now."},{"date": "20/09/2015", "arena": "Kiyan Prince Foundation Stadium", "attendance": 16163, "home_team": {"name": "Queens Park Rangers", "lineup": [{"name": "Robert Green", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mauricio Isla", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Caulker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rio Ferdinand", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Armand Traore", "yellows": [74], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joey Barton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [34]}, {"name": "Jordon Mutch", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [50]}, {"name": "Leroy Fer", "yellows": [85], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Niko Kranjcar", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charlie Austin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eduardo Vargas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [70]}], "subs": [{"name": "Matt Phillips", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [34], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex McCarthy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nedum Onuoha", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Karl Henry", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [50], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Richard Dunne", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Junior Hoilett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bobby Zamora", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [70], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Stoke City", "lineup": [{"name": "Asmir Begovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Bardsley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Shawcross", "yellows": [84], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marc Wilson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Erik Pieters", "yellows": [45], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Glenn Whelan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven N'Zonzi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mame Biram Diouf", "yellows": [81], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charlie Adam", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [70]}, {"name": "Victor Moses", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [79]}, {"name": "Peter Crouch", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Robert Huth", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marc Muniesa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marko Arnautovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [79], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steve Sidwell", "yellows": [88], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [70], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Oussama Assaidi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bojan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Thomas Sorensen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Niko Kranjcar’s stunning late free-kick secured Queens Park Rangers a 2-2 draw at home to Stoke City to spoil Mark Hughes’ return to Loftus Road. Former QPR boss Hughes appeared set to take three points off his old club when another Loftus Road old boy - Peter Crouch - restored Stoke’s lead until Kranjcar curled home an equaliser with two minutes left. Stoke took the lead on 11 minutes when Crouch climbed above Rio Ferdinand to knock down Victor Moses’ cross and Mame Biram Diouf stooped to head beyond Robert Green. Crouch was in the thick of things and he inadvertently contributed to QPR’s equaliser three minutes before half-time when he and Charlie Adam got in each other's way as they tried to clear Steven Caulker’s header, with the ball eventually being sliced into the roof of the net. Best of the Match: Man of the match: Peter Crouch looked bright from the off and not only contributed a well-taken goal and an assist, but also held the ball up well throughout. Goal of the match: Without doubt Niko Kranjcar’s curling free-kick into the top corner with just two minutes to go. He is always cool on the ball but sometimes can be accused of failing to deliver an end product – he delivered in style here. Moment of the match: There was a strange moment that looked like summing up QPR’s day as Rio Ferdinand stood with the ball at his feet looking for non-existent options up front before passing it three yards to Mauricio Isla, who failed to control the ball and unfortunately put it out for a Stoke throw. The home side ultimately claimed a point, but there were worrying signs in this match and this was one of them. Talking Point: Steve Sidwell’s tackle on Kranjcar just outside the area with two minutes to go. Sidwell hadn’t been on the pitch long so could still have been getting up to the speed of the game, but it was a rash decision to go in from behind and one all Stoke fans will be ruing for days. But Crouch then made a positive impact at the right end of the pitch six minutes into the second half when he swept home Moses’ cut-back from the left. A flurry of bookings seemed set to mark a scrappy conclusion to the game until Kranjcar whipped a brilliant free-kick over the wall and beyond Asmir Begovic’s reach to salvage QPR a point. Hughes - sacked following a testing 10-month spell in November 2012, after which the west London club slipped to relegation amid financial turmoil - was expecting plenty of abuse from the home supporters, and it was only a few minutes before chants against the former QPR boss rang around Loftus Road. The Welshman has, though, steadily rebuilt his reputation at Stoke, whom he guided to an impressive ninth-placed finish last season, and Hughes was pumping the air as his side went ahead. The ball was played out to Moses on the left, and his lofted cross was headed down by Crouch, who held off former England team-mate Ferdinand, and Diouf nodded it past Green. The visitors remained a threat on the break, but Diouf chose the wrong option when shooting at the edge of the penalty area when he had men over on both sides. Crouch was then unfortunate not to make it 2-0 after another quick break when played in by Moses at the edge of the penalty area. He took the ball in his stride before drilling a low effort just wide of Green's right-hand post. At the other end, Kranjcar fired a 25-yard effort just over the angle of post and bar. QPR captain Joey Barton, whose inclusion was one of four changes to the side beaten 4-0 at Manchester United last weekend, had to be replaced because of injury, with Matt Phillips coming on. The home side were level just before the break. A corner from Jordon Mutch on the left floated over to Caulker at the back post. His header down into the crowded six-yard box was toe-poked up into the Stoke net. QPR were forced into another change just after the restart when Mutch hobbled off, replaced by Karl Henry, and Stoke regained the lead in the 51st minute. Moses, on loan from Chelsea, caused problems down the left, squirming to the touchline before cutting the ball back into the box. Crouch, who had been linked with a summer move to QPR, dropped off Ferdinand, which gave him the time and space to fire a left-footed shot past Green for a first Premier League goal in 10 games. Stoke should have sealed victory on the break when Adam picked out Steven Nzonzi arriving in the right side of the penalty area, but his side-footed effort was wide. QPR felt they should have been awarded a penalty when Stoke captain Ryan Shawcross appeared to pull Caulker's shirt, but referee Martin Atkinson was not interested. With eight minutes left, there was a flashpoint as Shawcross clattered Kranjcar with a late sliding challenge, with Leroy Fer squaring up to the Stoke captain. Eventually, the referee booked both players, which did not go down well with the frustrated home support. Loftus Road was, though, soon rocking when, after being fouled by substitute Steve Sidwell, Kranjcar clipped a free-kick up over the wall into the top right corner, past the diving Begovic."},{"date":

Talking point: Aston Villa's complete capitulation, conceding three goals in four minutes having only conceded one goal all season. Villa had been the better team when the scores were level and the unmarked Ciaran Clark headed a great chance straight at Wojciech Szczesny before Arsenal took the lead on 32 minutes. A one-touch passing move resulted in Welbeck threading a pass through to Ozil and the much-maligned Germany international slid his shot past the onrushing Brad Guzan. Just 79 seconds later and Arsenal had scored a second goal, with the roles reversed as Ozil’s low cross was cushioned home by the unmarked Welbeck from six yards out for the striker’s first goal since his deadline day move from Manchester United. By the 36th minute, it was 3-0 when Kieran Gibbs' wayward low shot from the left-hand side was diverted into his own net by Cissokho. The second half saw Arsenal comfortably control the game to ensure Arsene Wenger’s side produced the ideal response to the midweek defeat by Borussia Dortmund in the UEFA Champions League. The hosts would have gone top of the Premier League with a win but, despite a bright start they were carved apart in front of watching chairman Randy Lerner - his first home game for almost two years. Ashley Westwood pulled out of the Villa squad during the warm-up with a virus and was replaced by Carlos Sanchez, with Joe Cole added to the bench. Clark also replaced Nathan Baker from the 1-0 win at Liverpool to partner Philippe Senderos. Deadline Day signing Danny Welbeck is happy to get his first goal for Arsenal and feels his performances will only improve. Deadline Day signing Danny Welbeck is happy to get his first goal for Arsenal and feels his performances will only improve. Arsenal made three changes from their 2-0 Champions League defeat in Dortmund as Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Santi Cazorla and Calum Chambers came in. Villa took advantage of Arsenal's overall indecisiveness as they made a strong start. Fabian Delph forced Szczesny into a low save after just two minutes following the goalkeeper's poor clearance. Welbeck fired over in response but Arsenal were given little time to settle by a vibrant Villa side. Alan Hutton nodded over on 17 minutes as Villa continued to carve out the best chances and they should have taken the lead five minutes later. Chambers was booked for bringing down Gabby Agbonlahor and Clark met Tom Cleverley's delivery at the far post, only to be denied by a point-blank save from Szczesny. But the Gunners stunned Villa with three quick-fire goals to win the game. There wasn’t a lot of difference between the two teams for quite a while in this game. It all changed just after the half-hour mark and it was quite emphatic. Three goals in three minutes. Unbelievable. They blew Villa away and that was it. Phil Thompson The hosts had been edging the contest but collapsed suddenly, starting when Welbeck teed up Ozil to run through and coolly roll past Guzan for his first goal of the season on 32 minutes. Then the World Cup winner repaid the favour when he crossed from the left and Welbeck smashed in from close range. Villa were shell-shocked and they were bypassed again on 36 minutes when Gibbs' cross was turned in by the sliding Cissokho. While the half-time scoreline was harsh on the hosts, the Gunners had taken control and Guzan claimed Welbeck's effort soon after the break. Clark had a chance to haul Villa back into the game on 57 minutes but was thwarted by Oxlade-Chamberlain after Ramsey needlessly conceded a corner. Villa's threat had waned though and Arsenal were in cruise control as they eased to victory."},{"date": "20/09/2015", "arena": "Turf Moor", "attendance": 20026, "home_team": {"name": "Burnley", "lineup": [{"name": "Tom Heaton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kieran Trippier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Duff", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jason Shackell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Mee", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Scott Arfield", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Jones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [86]}, {"name": "Dean Marney", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "George Boyd", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Lukas Jutkiewicz", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marvin Sordell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [63]}], "subs": [{"name": "Ross Wallace", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [86], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Kightly", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Reid", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matthew Gilks", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stephen Ward", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Keane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Barnes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [63], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Sunderland", "lineup": [{"name": "Vito Mannone", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Santiago Vergini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John O'Shea", "yellows": [78], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wes Brown", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Patrick van Aanholt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lee Cattermole", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sebastian Larsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [67]}, {"name": "Jack Rodwell", "yellows": [62], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Emanuele Giaccherini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [73]}, {"name": "Adam Johnson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [67]}, {"name": "Connor Wickham", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Costel Pantilimon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Billy Jones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Liam Bridcutt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordi Gomez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [67], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jozy Altidore", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [67], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Graham", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Will Buckley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [73], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "George Boyd: Tackles Santiago Vergini at Turf Moor Burnley and Sunderland are both still looking for their first wins of the season after a 0-0 draw at Turf Moor. The home side showed why they have struggled to get among the goals so far this season, creating very little against a well-organised Sunderland side. They did almost grab a late winner however, with Ashley Barnes' deflected shot coming back off the crossbar. However, the real drama was down the other end in the dying moments, as Tom Heaton produced a stunning stoppage-time save to tip Patrick van Aanholt's long-range effort onto the post and secure a point for his Burnley side. Best of the Match Man of the Match: David Jones. Was at the heart of everything positive from Burnley. Moment of the Match: Jones injury. Burnley have a small squad, so any injury will be felt. Save of the Match: Tom Heaton. Will struggle to see a better one all season than Heaton's stop from Van Aarnholt effort. Talking Points: Is Burnley's lack of firepower going to be their downfall? Will Sunderland struggle again? What has happened to Connor Wickham's form? Burnley, who have not found the net since their opening game, climb out of the relegation zone after the stalemate, while Sunderland's fourth draw in five games sees them rise to 15th. The match began with Burnley very much in the ascendancy, with Sean Dyche’s men really taking the game to the visitors. Marvin Sordell, deputising for the injured Danny Ings, really should have done better when picked out by George Boyd in the box, but he completely missed his kick. Charlie Nicholas admits Burnley could find themselves in trouble if their drought in front of goal continues. Charlie Nicholas admits Burnley could find themselves in trouble if their drought in front of goal continues. On his return to the starting XI, Emanuele Giaccherini tested Heaton in the Burnley goal, but his curling effort was well saved by the former Manchester United youngster. Connor Wickham, who has yet to regain his form that was so crucial to Sunderland staying up last season, then found space on the edge of the box, but his powerful strike lacked direction, and Heaton easily saved. After the break, Sunderland did their best to dictate the tempo without creating any real clear-cut chances. Burnley have to do more. I’ve just got a feeling that as time goes on and they start to get tougher games the energy will drain from them and they could be left exposed. Charlie Nicholas Giaccherini did do well to get to the byline and pull the ball back for Jack Rodwell but Burnley skipper Jason Shackell just nipped in to clear the danger. Lukas Jutkiewicz was having a good physical battle with the Sunderland backline, and was almost guilty of being too honest, staying on his feet after being fouled by John O’Shea to get a shot at goal which Vito Mannone saved well. There was real drama late on as the woodwork denied both sides a late winner. First, substitute Barnes’ deflected effort came back off the crossbar after being teed up by Scott Arfield, with Mannone beaten. Then a short free-kick interchange between Jordi Gomez and van Aanholt allowed the teenage defender the space to unleash a ferocious effort at goal from fully 30 yards. Heaton looked beaten, but leaped to his left to tip it onto the post, with the rebound luckily hitting his heels and spinning wide."},{"date": "20/09/2015", "arena": "St James' Park, Newcastle", "attendance": 49119, "home_team": {"name": "Newcastle United", "lineup": [{"name": "Tim Krul", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daryl Janmaat", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mike Williamson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fabricio Coloccini", "yellows": [52], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paul Dummett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cheick Tiote", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [85]}, {"name": "Jack Colback", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Moussa Sissoko", "yellows": [59], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rémy Cabella", "yellows": [73], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yoan Gouffran", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Emmanuel Riviere", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [69]}], "subs": [{"name": "Vurnon Anita", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Papiss Cisse", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [69], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ayoze Pérez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Massadio Haidara", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rob Elliot", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Taylor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sammy Ameobi", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [85], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Hull City", "lineup": [{"name": "Allan McGregor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ahmed Elmohamady", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Dawson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Curtis Davies", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andrew Robertson", "yellows": [59], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [88]}, {"name": "Jake Livermore", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Huddlestone", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mohamed Diamé", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stephen Quinn", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nikica Jelavic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [81]}, {"name": "Abel Hernandez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [56]}], "subs": [{"name": "Liam Rosenior", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [88], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Chester", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Meyler", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [81], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robbie Brady", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steve Harper", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sone Aluko", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [56], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gaston Ramirez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Substitute Papiss Cisse saved the day for Newcastle and under-fire manager Alan Pardew with two goals to earn a 2-2 draw with Hull City at St James' Park. Pardew, whose position has come under increasing scrutiny in recent weeks, looked to have been pushed closer to the exit as Hull powered into a 2-0 lead in the second half. Nikica Jelavic opened the scoring with a stunning scissor kick in the 48th minute before Mohamed Diame’s pile-driver from outside the box just as Cisse was preparing to come on saw the home fans turn their anger towards Pardew and owner Mike Ashley. Best of the match: Man of the match: Papiss Cisse only joined the fray in the 69th minute, but his two goals saved a point for Newcastle and could have kept Alan Pardew in his job. Goal of the match: Nikica Jelavic’s opener was simply stunning, with the Croatia international executing a perfect scissor kick to leave Tim Krul with no chance. Miss of the match: Stephen Quinn found himself with the goal at his mercy after a Tom Huddlestone free-kick was deflected, but somehow blazed wide. Talking point: Is this merely a stay of execution for Alan Pardew, or could his be a turning point for Newcastle? But the Senegal striker, who has been out since April with a serious knee injury, drilled a low shot beyond Allan McGregor at his near post to reduce the deficit in the 73rd minute. And with just three minutes remaining, Cisse was on hand to smash home from close range after Yoan Gouffran had headed Moussa Sissoko’s deep cross back into the six-yard box. Fans arriving at St James' Park were provided with placards urging Ashley to dismiss Pardew, although the owner had earlier indicated privately that there would be no knee-jerk reaction to the current situation. Despite talk all week of concerted protests, the 53-year-old was initially booed only sporadically on his forays into the technical area. Groups of supporters repeatedly tried to engage their counterparts in anti-Pardew - and Ashley - chants, but their efforts received lukewarm and fleeting support as most of the locals instead chose to roar on their team. The response was concerted and although they headed back to the dressing room at half-time with the deadlock unbroken, they had enjoyed the better of the opening 45 minutes and created the clearer chances. Unfortunately for Pardew, they were unable to convert any of them on an afternoon when the club's failure to find a replacement for Loic Remy during the summer transfer window was brought into sharp focus once again. Newcastle manager Alan Pardew was quick to praise his player's character as they came back from two goals down to seal a draw at home to Hull. Newcastle manager Alan Pardew was quick to praise his player's character as they came back from two goals down to seal a draw at home to Hull. Lone frontman Emmanuel Riviere, still awaiting his first competitive goal for the club, headed wide with five minutes gone and saw a ninth-minute shot blocked by defender Michael Dawson. In the meantime, Remy Cabella, who found himself able to roam more freely with Cheick Tiote patrolling the area behind him, had toe-poked an effort straight at keeper McGregor after running on to Sissoko's pass. Gouffran headed straight at McGregor and full-back Daryl Janmaat blazed high and wide from distance in an encouraging start for the Magpies, but as the half wore on, Pardew's men rather ran out of steam with Riviere's 38th-minute glancing header across the face of goal as close as they came to troubling the Tigers' keeper thereafter. For their part, Hull were able to create little of note despite the muscular efforts of Diame in the middle of the park, although Jelavic shot straight at keeper Tim Krul after full-back Andrew Robertson had surged down the left and pulled the ball back for him with 24 minutes gone. Steve Bruce was disappointed with Hull's result as they sacrificed a 2-0 lead to draw away at Newcastle. Steve Bruce was disappointed with Hull's result as they sacrificed a 2-0 lead to draw away at Newcastle. However, the Croatian made no mistake when presented with his second clear-cut chance three minutes into the second half. Jack Colback was guilty of dwelling on the ball inside his own penalty area and when it was fed out to Ahmed Elmohamady, he clipped it towards Jelavic, who volleyed it spectacularly past the helpless Krul. Anti-Pardew chants rang out once again, but the home fans were on their feet with 54 minutes gone as Cabella met Mike Williamson's driven cross with a firm side-foot only to see McGregor get down well to block it with his legs. The Scot denied the Frenchman once again with a brave block three minutes later, seconds after substitute Sone Aluko had only just failed to make a meaningful connection with Robertson's left-wing cross at the other end. Papiss Cisse was delighted to get on the scoresheet as the striker came off the bench to rescue a point for Newcastle at home to Hull. Papiss Cisse was delighted to get on the scoresheet as the striker came off the bench to rescue a point for Newcastle at home to Hull. Krul was relieved to see Stephen Quinn fire wide from no distance at all after Tom Huddlestone's 62nd-minute shot had fortuitously ricocheted to him off the defensive wall, but he was not so fortunate six minutes later. Diame was allowed time and space to move the ball on to his left foot before unleashing a shot which screamed past Krul and in off the upright. Pardew had Cisse ready on the sideline as the second goal went in, and his decision to use him as a replacement rather than strike partner for Riviere did not go down well. However, the Senegal international made his mark within five minutes of his arrival, drilling a shot past McGregor at his near post from Tiote's pass to spark a frenzied conclusion to the game. And there was more to come from Cisse as he stabbed home an 87th-minute equaliser from Gouffran's knockdown to snatch a point.

Matthew Le Tissier reflects on Newcastle's comeback against Hull as Papiss Cisse came off the bench to seal a 2-2 draw at St James Park. Matt Le Tissier: I guess under the circumstances, Alan Pardew would probably say it’s a decent point. Hull, to give them credit, are a decent side and given they were 2-0 down it’s a very good point at the end of the day. Whether or not that would have been a good point at the start of the day is probably a different matter. I wouldn’t have said Newcastle were really good at times. I think they gave it their all, but there wasn’t a huge amount of quality in their play. I didn’t see them really dominate the game for long periods with great play.

Best of the match: Man of the match: Victor Wanyama - He came on with 20 minutes to go and made an immediate impact by scoring the winner. Goal of the match: Wanyama scored his first goal in 16 months after playing a neat one-two with Graziano Pelle before rifling his toe-poke past Lukasz Fabianski. Moment of the match: Wilfried Bony took out Maya Yoshid not once, but twice, to leave referee Jon Moss no option but to show him his second yellow card which equals red. Save of the match: Ryan Bertrand was brilliantly positioned at the back post to clear Bony's first-half header off the line and save a certain goal. Stat of the match: Wanyama became the first Kenyan to score a goal in the Premier League. The visitors found an unlikely match-winner in Wanyama, who scored his first goal for the Saints since signing from Celtic with an excellent angled finish just as Swansea looked like withstanding intense second-half pressure. Swansea boss Garry Monk saw his main talisman Wilfried Bony sent-off six minutes before half-time after picking up two yellow cards, both for rash tackles on Maya Yoshida. Referee Jon Moss was at the centre of plenty of controversy and brandished his yellow card six times in a feisty encounter. Ronald Koeman's troops made hard work of their win after having plenty of possession in the second 45 minutes, but they did find a way through 10 minutes from time thanks to Wanyama's close-range toe-poke which flew into the far corner to give Southampton their third consecutive victory. There was little time for a response from the 10-men of Swansea, who suffer back-to-back defeats. Meanwhile, Saints leapfrog them at the business end of the Premier League table. Roy Hodgson was visiting the Liberty Stadium for the first time in his capacity as England manager and there were two fascinating battles on the flanks for him to assess. Victor Wanyama praised Saints' patience Victor Wanyama praised Saints' patience Nathan Dyer was up against Ryan Bertrand and Nathaniel Clyne was marking Wayne Routledge, and the Swansea wingers enjoyed early success. Routledge sent over an excellent 12th-minute cross but Dyer was unable to make a proper connection and Bertrand cleared the danger. Swansea were calling the shots in the early stages and Gylfi Sigurdsson fired straight at Fraser Forster in the Saints goal before Routledge sent an ambitious volley wide. The temperature levels rose as Bony and Jose Fonte picked up bookings for fouls and Yoshida was also cautioned for dissent after Dyer clattered into Shane Long. Ronald Koeman hails win Ronald Koeman hails win Swansea almost took a 28th-minute lead when Sigurdsson slipped through Routledge and the winger, choosing to shoot with the outside of his right foot, struck the top of the crossbar. Southampton had not offered much in attack but a free-flowing move involving Dusan Tadic and Bertrand ended with Graziano Pelle scuffing a shot which Lukasz Fabianski comfortably collected at his near post. But Saints were fortunate to survive when Bony met Sigurdsson's corner and Bertrand was in the right place to clear off the line. It was Bony's last positive involvement as he soon saw red. Southampton inevitably dominated the second period, both in terms of possession and territory, as Swansea left Sigurdsson up front on his own and retreated deeper and deeper towards their own goal. Garry Monk said Swansea deserved more Garry Monk said Swansea deserved more Tadic's deflected drive ended up on the roof of the Swansea net and Clyne crossed for Pelle to send a header straight at Fabianski on his goal-line. The Serbian was really starting to pose problems down Swansea's right and his cross found the head of Pelle, whose header forced Fabianski to tip over. Pelle had an even better opportunity when substitute Steven Davis picked him out. The unmarked Italian headed wide from 10 yards, but the striker redeemed himself when he sent Wanyama through for the decisive goal 10 minutes from time. Paul Merson on Swansea 0-1 Southampton Bony got two stone-wall bookings and they completely changed the game. Swansea were the better team and they were getting on top. I have never seen a team looking so comfortable with 11 men against 10; Southampton completely dominated but the winner came from real luck. When Wanyama came on I’ve never seen a manager look so disappointed at bringing a player on. He didn’t want to put him on, but he was the difference in the end and got a great goal. After that they were as comfortable as can be. I love people who celebrate goals. It’s the best feeling in the world, playing football and scoring a goal but he just stood there and looked at everybody as if to go 'I’ll do it again next week'.

The hosts burst out of the blocks and saw their early endeavour rewarded as Winston Reid bundled home inside 90 seconds and Diafra Sakho doubled their advantage soon after. Best of the match Man of the match: Diafra Sakho was full of running for 90 minutes, posed plenty of problems and netted a great goal. Goal of the match: Sakho floated a delicate chipped effort to perfection to leave Simon Mignolet rooted to the spot. Moment of the match: Fabio Borini drilled one good opportunity for Liverpool over the top in the second half and they never looked life drawing level after that. Talking point: What are West Ham capable of this season if they can find consistency? Have Liverpool got enough to lift themselves into the title race? Raheem Sterling was able to pull one back for Brendan Rodgers’ visitors, who have now lost three of their opening five fixtures, but a poor clearance from Mamadou Sakho late on led to Morgan Amalfitano being teed up to seal the win for Sam Allardyce’s side. Liverpool are now six points behind leaders Chelsea in the table, having played a game more, while the pressure on Allardyce, in front of his own fans at least, has lessened with a first home win of the season. Liverpool needed a last-gasp penalty to beat Ludogorets on their UEFA Champions League return in midweek, but face a test of their top four credentials this season. The Reds, runners-up last term, were expected to add to West Ham's misery and inflict a third home loss of the season after Tottenham Hotspur and Southampton won last month. Liverpool had Martin Skrtel restored following a three-match absence with a knee injury, but a defensive reshuffle was required after 22 minutes, by which time the visitors were already two down. The source of the first goal was former Reds winger Stewart Downing, whose inswinging free-kick found James Tomkins at the back post. Impress Tomkins' header back across the six-yard box was turned goalwards by Reid, whose header went in off Dejan Lovren. Raheem Sterling: Reply not enough for Liverpool Downing seemed determined to impress and danced around Steven Gerrard before Mark Noble darted from left to right and fed Diafra Sakho. The Senegal forward, a summer recruit from Metz, burst into the area and had the audacity to lob the ball over Simon Mignolet into the far corner for his third goal in three games. Aaron Cresswell then tried his luck from 25 yards and Mignolet turned the ball round the post. The closest Liverpool came to the Hammers goal in the opening 20 minutes was when Mario Balotelli attempted to block an Adrian clearance and tangled with the goalkeeper, who kicked out before facing off with the striker. Both men were booked. Brendan Rodgers was disappointed with his side's slow start, which saw them fall 2-0 behind inside seven minutes and felt they never got going against West Brendan Rodgers was disappointed with his side's slow start, which saw them fall 2-0 behind inside seven minutes and felt they never got going against West A frustrated Rodgers hauled off Javier Manquillo for Mamadou Sakho and switched to a back three in an attempt to wrest some of the initiative from Cheikhou Kouyate and Alex Song in midfield. Liverpool struck back when Balotelli pulled down a Jordan Henderson cross from the left and saw his shot blocked by Cresswell. The ball ricocheted to Sterling, who drilled a low first-time volley into the far corner. Bombardment West Ham continued to press forward and Mignolet turned a Enner Valencia free-kick round the post. West Ham manager Sam Allardyce praised his side's performance during their win over Liverpool, believing it was a thoroughly deserved victory. West Ham manager Sam Allardyce praised his side's performance during their win over Liverpool, believing it was a thoroughly deserved victory. Lovren required lengthy treatment after colliding with his team-mate Mamadou Sakho. He initially appeared groggy but returned following a change of shirt, with a heavily bandaged head and after a consultation with the tunnel doctor in compliance with Premier League concussion rules. Mignolet saved from Valencia as the Hammers' bombardment continued. Adam Lallana replaced Lucas at half-time and tried to tee up Sterling, who dragged his shot wide. Liverpool exerted some more pressure, with Fabio Borini and Balotelli each twice finding shooting space without really testing Adrian. As the visitors pushed forwards, gaps in their defence became evident. Diafra Sakho was unable to punish a Skrtel lapse as he lifted the ball over, but a third West Ham goal came when they broke and Downing threaded the ball through for substitute Amalfitano to score."},{"date": "15/09/2015", "arena": "KCOM Stadium", "attendance": 21275, "home_team": {"name": "Hull City", "lineup": [{"name": "Allan McGregor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [],

However, Hernandez was then emulated by another debutant, as Enner Valencia, on his first start for the Hammers, unleashed a thunderous equaliser just five minutes after the break. Former Hammer Mohamed Diame coolly converted an opportunist chance to give the home side the lead for the second time in the match after 64 minutes, but once again the visitors came straight back, this time after Diafra Sakho's cross-shot managed to evade Hull keeper Allan McGregor and rebound off the legs of City skipper Curtis Davies to level proceedings for the second time.

It was a very cagey affair in the opening exchanges, with neither side managing to create any meaningful chances, and possession was squandered far too frequently. Stewart Downing had the best of the early chances, playing a neat one-two before lashing the ball over the bar from the angle. Another debutant Sakho did come mightily close as the game opened up, only to see his deflected header brilliantly clawed away by Allan McGregor with the goal gaping. However, a rare piece of first-half quality broke the deadlock, with Hernandez showing why Hull boss Steve Bruce parted with such a hefty fee to secure his services, getting up highest to head a pinpoint Ahmed Elmohamady cross past the despairing dive of West Ham stopper Adrian. Sam Allardyce felt his side gave a very good performance in their 2-2 draw with Hull and says they can get better. Sam Allardyce felt his side gave a very good performance in their 2-2 draw with Hull and says they can get better. On a high, Hernandez tried his luck from distance just before the break, but his rasping effort came back off the underside of the crossbar, with Adrian beaten. The Hammers needed the break, and came out a different side after Allardyce had obviously rallied his troops in the dressing room. And their pressure told, as Valencia produced an incredible strike to make matters all square. It looked like the Ecuadorian forward had run out of ideas, but he shifted the ball to his right, and fired an unstoppable effort past a helpless McGregor to equalise. Adrian saved well from Hernandez as Hull looked to immediately respond, but the home fans, who voiced their disapproval at plans to sell the club all evening, did not have to wait long for their side to regain the lead. Against his former club Diame simply showed more desire than Cheikhou Kouyate, stealing the ball off the West Ham midfielder, carrying it forward and curling a sublime effort past Adrian. Yet, once again, Hull were caught out at the back just two minutes later. A lovely disguised pass from Downing played Sakho in, who turned and fired goalwards, but Davies in trying to block got in all kinds of trouble, and diverted the ball just over the line. Adrian saved well from substitute Robbie Brady as the hosts went in search of a winner, but it was Valencia who almost snatched three points right at the death. Picked out at the back post, the 25-year-old escaped his defender, headed down into the ground, beat McGregor, but Dawson managed to somehow flick the ball onto the crossbar, and over."},{"date":

spark as they crushed hapless Queens Park Rangers 4-0 at Old Trafford. Angel di Maria, at his creative best, opened the scoring on his home debut, with another summer signing, Ander Herrera, club captain Wayne Rooney and Juan Mata also getting in on the act. Best of the match Man of the match: Angel di Maria. Dazzled on his home debut. Netted a fortuitous goal but pulled the strings as United dictated from the start. Goal of the match: Ander Herrera rounded off a free-flowing counter attack led by Di Maria and taken on by Rooney, with the Spaniard teed up to drill low into the bottom corner. Pass of the match: Di Maria’s vision was a joy to behold and one audacious flick with the outside of his left boot almost saw Robin van Persie volley in a fifth. Moment of the match: Radamel Falcao’s introduction brought the Old Trafford faithful to their feet and highlighted how many attacking options Louis van Gaal now has at his disposal. Talking point: Can United fire themselves into the title race on the back of this result? Have QPR got enough about them to steer clear of trouble? Louis van Gaal has spent big in an effort to turn United’s fortunes around and, with Marcos Rojo and Daley Blind thrown in from the start and Radamel Falcao introduced off the bench, the Dutchman got the response he was looking for as the hosts dominated against a visiting side which included former favourite Rio Ferdinand. It took 24 minutes of patient probing for the deadlock to be broken, with Di Maria swinging over a curling free-kick from the right which dipped over the heads of those inside the box and nestled into the back of the net. Herrera doubled the advantage on 36 minutes, with the Spaniard drilling low into the bottom corner after being picked out by Rooney. The England captain then added his name to score sheet on the stroke of half-time, reversing a shot inside the near post, before Mata wrapped things up just before the hour mark as he gathered a driven cross-shot from Di Maria and calmly lifted the ball over an onrushing Robert Green. Excitement Despite the public excitement surrounding the arrival of Falcao, Ferdinand received the biggest reception from the home fans before kick-off. The former United centre-half, who complained he was not given a proper send off in the summer, received a huge ovation as well as a present from Sir Bobby Charlton just before kick-off. After the first whistle sounded, it did not take long for Ferdinand's old team-mates, and United's new signings, to put him under immense pressure. MATCH HIGHLIGHTS Sky Sports subscribers can watch highlights of Man Utd's 4-0 win over QPR. Mata raced down the left and whipped in a perfect ball for Rooney, but mis-controlled and Ferdinand hooked the ball clear. Van Gaal wrote in his pre-match notes that he was worried about nervousness gripping his players at Old Trafford, but that was certainly not the case on Sunday. United passed the ball quickly and confidently, and they tested the away defence with a series of teasing crosses. Herrera pulled the ball back to Mata after a clever nutmeg from Rafael, but the former Chelsea man skied his shot. Radamel Falcao: Introduced off the bench for his Manchester United debut Down the left, Rojo lobbed the ball to the back post where Herrera cocked his right leg back ready to fire a volley at goal, but Van Persie clumsily nicked the ball away from the Spaniard. Pressure With so much pressure on them, it only seemed a matter of time before QPR conceded, and they did in the 24th minute. After a needless foul on Herrera by Clint Hill, Di Maria whipped a curling ball over the heads of four players and the ball drifted in past Green at his far post. Louis van Gaal was delighted with Manchester United’s display in their 4-0 win over QPR at Old Trafford but says that the club can still improve in areas. Louis van Gaal was delighted with Manchester United’s display in their 4-0 win over QPR at Old Trafford but says that the club can still improve in areas. Within a few minutes of Di Maria's first United goal, the hosts almost handed QPR a route back into the match. David De Gea, usually such a calm operator, raced out of the box trying to clear a long punt up field from Niko Kranjcar. The goalkeeper failed to communicate with Jonny Evans and the ball fell to Matt Phillips, but he failed to turn the ball into the empty net and United's fans breathed again. Those same fans were up on their feet moments later when United moved 2-0 ahead. Once again Di Maria played an important part, racing 50 yards down the left before playing Rooney in with a lovely pass between two defenders. The striker's shot was blocked, but he then squared to Herrera, who drilled the ball past Green. Angel di Maria played a starring role for Manchester United as Louis van Gaal claimed his first win as United's manager by beating QPR 4-0 at Old Trafford. Angel di Maria played a starring role for Manchester United as Louis van Gaal claimed his first win as United's manager by beating QPR 4-0 at Old Trafford. The Stretford End demanded United attack and they did. Just before half-time Rooney made it 3-0. Delicious Herrera played a delicious one-two with Mata and he touched the ball off to Rooney, who powered a low shot past Green. QPR boss Redknapp replaced Hill with Armand Traore at half-time and the former Arsenal defender made an immediate impression, driving at the United defence with a long run. He squared to Kranjcar, who shot at goal, but De Gea stuck his right foot out just in time. Harry Redknapp felt that Manchester United were not as good as the score line suggests after his QPR team were beat 4-0 by United at Old Trafford. Harry Redknapp felt that Manchester United were not as good as the score line suggests after his QPR team were beat 4-0 by United at Old Trafford. A large number of United fans rose to applaud Falcao as he warmed up on the touchline. Those whose focus remained on the game watched United bag a fourth. Di Maria adventurously attempted a 25-yard effort which instead landed straight at Mata's feet. The Spaniard, three yards clear of his nearest marker Ferdinand, tucked the ball past Green from 10 yards. Falcao came on with 23 minutes to go to link up with Rooney and Van Persie in a devastating front three. United's defensive vulnerabilities were highlighted when Tyler Blackett moved aside to allow Eduardo Vargas to shoot on goal, but he dragged his effort wide. Di Maria cramped up and had to come off with 10 minutes to go. Green spilled Blind's long-range shot in the dying minutes, but Falcao could not get there in time to score a debut goal, not that it mattered."},{"date": "13/09/2015", "arena": "Emirates Stadium",

rivals Arsenal in a pulsating encounter at Emirates Stadium. City had taken a first-half lead through Sergio Aguero, only for Arsenal to respond with fine goals from Jack Wilshere and Alexis Sanchez before veteran defender Demichelis earned the Premier League champions a point. Danny Welbeck was presented with an early chance to vindicate his selection as Arsenal’s main striker when he seized on David Silva’s poor pass, but the deadline day signing’s dink over Joe Hart came back off the post. Arsenal were in the ascendancy in the first half, but were rocked on their heels on 28 minutes when City broke with pace and Jesus Navas’ excellent low ball into the box was cleverly finished by Aguero. Best of the Match: Man of the match: Jack Wilshere was the key man in Arsenal’s second-half fightback, scoring the equaliser with a superb shimmy and cool finish before setting up Alexis’ stunning volley. Goal of the match: All the goals had quality about them, but Alexis’ side-foot volley from Wilshere’s header to put Arsenal in front was the one that got you out of your chair. Attempt of the match: With 12 minutes on the clock, Danny Welbeck was inches away from a dream start to his Arsenal career after being played in by a wild pass from David Silva. Welbeck raced onto the loose ball, dinked it over the onrushing Joe Hart… and watched helpless as it cannoned back into play off the inside of the post. Save of the match: Wojciech Szczesny had to be at his best in injury time to preserve a point for Arsenal, coming off his line swiftly and getting a strong right hand to Edin Dzeko’s shot across goal. Samir Nasri slotted home the rebound, but was clearly offside. Talking point: For an Arsenal team that so often struggles to take three points off their biggest rivals in the division, was this a missed opportunity against a Yaya Toure-less Manchester City? The Gunners were the better side before Aguero opened the scoring and led in the closing stages. The home side levelled on 63 minutes when Aaron Ramsey played in Wilshere, who skipped past former team-mate Gael Clichy before lifting a delightful shot over Joe Hart into the net. Wilshere turned provider for Arsenal to take the lead on 74 minutes when he headed the ball back into the box after City could only partially clear and Alexis steered a firm volley beyond Hart. England midfielder Wilshere appeared fortunate not to concede a penalty for handball and, after Mathieu Debuchy was stretchered off, City struck back with seven minutes to go. Substitute Aleksandar Kolarov curled out a corner and Demichelis rose unmarked to head beyond Wojciech Szczesny, who appeared to touch the ball away from the covering Mathieu Flamini. Welbeck whipped an effort narrowly wide in his last act before being substituted due to injury, Kolarov thundered a shot against the post, Laurent Koscielny’s clearance hit Edin Dzeko before bouncing back off the upright and former Arsenal midfielder Samir Nasri saw a goal disallowed for offside as six minutes of added time failed to yield a winner. Frank Lampard made his City debut after Yaya Toure played for the Ivory Coast in midweek but he lasted only until half-time, with a foul on Ramsey that earned a yellow card his headline moment. Ramsey started in Arsenal's midfield after recovering from an ankle injury, but all eyes were on Welbeck's first appearance for the Gunners. His first touch was greeted with a roar of approval from home fans and expectation continued to grip Emirates Stadium as Alexis tested Hart from long range. Somehow Aguero threaded a path between three defenders, but the angle was too tight to produce a meaningful shot and Arsenal immediately renewed their offensive. Welbeck failed to connect with Mesut Ozil's delicate pass and moments later the England forward had a glorious chance to put Arsenal ahead after intercepting Silva's ill-judged back pass. Only Hart stood between Welbeck and a debut goal but his attempted chip drifted on to the left post. Arsenal had bristled with intent in a superb start, but City's ability to threaten on the counter was highlighted when Navas broke clear and forced a key clearance from Per Mertesacker. Moments after Alexis had almost ghosted through City's defence, the champions struck a clinical opening goal after a 50-50 clearance in midfield looped over to an unmarked Navas on the right wing. The Spaniard set off and delayed his pass perfectly for the arriving Aguero to slide his shot past Szczesny. Szczesny then had to prod clear a shot by Silva after Pablo Zabaleta exploited Arsenal's left flank - and particularly outclassed full-back Nacho Monreal - once again. Aguero's goal had clearly deflated the Gunners and it was not until the opening exchanges of the second half that they threatened again - only for Zabaleta to prevent Welbeck from reaching Alexis’ cross. Just as Arsenal appeared to be fading once more, they struck a 63rd-minute equaliser through Wilshere. Aguero lost the ball in midfield and Alexis pounced, threading a pass to Ramsey who found Wilshere. The England international still had work to do, but he expertly rounded Clichy with a wonderful touch before lofting the ball over Hart. And 11 minutes later Wilshere was involved as Arsenal surged ahead through Alexis, who volleyed his team-mate's header into the net after a failed clearance from Vincent Kompany. Demichelis capitalised on poor defending to plunder City's equaliser and Arsenal were relieved to see the flag go up after their former player Nasri stabbed the ball into the net in stoppage time."},{"date": "13/09/2015", "arena": "Stamford Bridge", "attendance": 41400, "home_team": {"name": "Chelsea", "lineup": [{"name": "Thibaut Courtois", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [],

Swansea were the better team in the first half and edged in front on 11 minutes when Neil Taylor’s teasing low cross was turned into his own net by Chelsea captain Terry. Chelsea equalised in the final minute of the half when Cesc Fabregas’ corner was powerfully headed home by Costa, who became the first player since Mick Quinn in 1992 to score in his first four Premier League appearances. Best of the Match: Man of the match: Diego Costa. The Spaniard put on a master class in finishing as he scored his first Premier League hat-trick. Moment of the match: Diego Costa guiding home his third goal after getting clear in the six-yard area, to make it seven goals in four games for Chelsea. Save of the match: Lukasz Fabianski getting his fingertips to an Andre Schurrle dipping free-kick. Goal of the match: While Diego Costa scored a hat-trick of close-range goals, Loic Remy marked his debut with a well-taken first-time effort from inside the area to open his Chelsea account. Talking point: Chelsea's dominant start to the league campaign, with Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas striking up a fearsome partnership early on. The same two players combined to put Chelsea in front on 56 minutes as Fabregas exchanged passes with Eden Hazard before pulling the ball back for Costa to score from close range. Costa’s opportunism brought the Spain international’s hat-trick on 67 minutes as he reacted the quickest to Ramires’ weak shot to stab the ball past Lukasz Fabianski. Remy replaced Costa and the substitute marked his debut with the fourth goal on 81 minutes with a low finish after the striker was teed up by Oscar. Jonjo Shelvey pulled one back for Swansea with four minutes to go, but the result ensures Chelsea are the only team with a 100 per cent record after four games. Jose Mourinho might have been tempted to keep Costa in reserve for games against Schalke and Manchester City next week after a hamstring injury saw him withdraw from international duty with Spain. But it soon became apparent that the Blues would need him after Swansea started well. Wayne Routledge volleyed wide and then dispossessed Nemanja Matic in a challenge he should not have won in the move which led to the opening goal. Ki Sung-yeung, influential early on, fed left-back Taylor, whose cross Terry could only turn in to his own net. Bafetimbi Gomis - Swansea's one change following the 3-0 defeat of West Brom, Wilfried Bony dropping to the bench - twice had half chances but could not find the target. Routledge curled one narrowly wide as Swansea threatened again before Chelsea finally came into the game. Jordi Amat and Shelvey were each booked for fouls on Hazard on the edge of the Swansea box and from the second opportunity Andre Schurrle's free-kick was tipped over by Fabianski. A Branislav Ivanovic cross evaded Costa and was headed over by Oscar, who then tested Fabianski with a low shot before his dangerous cross from the right was dealt with by the Polish goalkeeper. Costa and Amat tangled on the touchline as the striker showed his menace before delivering another blow. A lot stuff Diego Costa does looks a bit clumsy at times and you wonder if he's a top-class player in the terms of Messi, Neymar or Suarez. I said I thought he was over-rated in terms of the player they think he is, but I was wrong. This guy has the ‘wow’ factor. Now he has got to prove himself next week when they go to Manchester City because those are the games that matter to top-class players. Charlie Nicholas The £32million summer signing - a man Mourinho chased for a year - lurked behind Ivanovic before meeting a Fabregas corner with a low, firm header. Mourinho was clearly not satisfied with seeing his team reach the interval level as World Cup winner Schurrle was replaced by Ramires. Amat, treading a fine line against Costa, went off for Federico Fernandez for Swansea. Costa immediately tested Swansea's defence, his effort from a corner ballooning over off Ivanovic. Soon Chelsea - and Costa - had a second after a one-two between Fabregas and Hazard on the left edge of the Swansea box. In a combination that is becoming familiar even at this early stage in the season, Fabregas laid on the assist, pulling the ball back for Costa to finish clinically. Shelvey sliced wide and Gomis was unable to lift the ball over the onrushing Thibaut Courtois, who had a quiet second half as he celebrated his new five-year contract. Courtois watched from afar as Costa struck once more when Ramires scuffed his shot into the path of the striker, who pounced to complete his hat-trick. Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich smiled widely and joined in the applause as Costa departed after 72 minutes for Remy to make his debut. Remy, signed only after Fernando Torres' loan move to AC Milan, quickly made his mark, tucking in Oscar's pass. Shelvey pulled a goal back with four minutes to play after substitute Bony's incisive pass. Mourinho tucked the ball under his arm after it entered his technical area from the restart and Swansea could not breach the Chelsea defence again."},{"date": "13/09/2015", "arena": "Selhurst Park",

off a stunning late penalty save to deny Burnley a dramatic victory in an entertaining, but goalless draw at Selhurst Park. Palace looked likely to pay the price for letting a host of chances go begging when Mike Dean pointed to the spot in the 86th minute, but Scott Arfield's well-struck penalty was brilliantly parried to safety by the Eagles keeper. Scott Dann hit the bar for Neil Warnock's strugglers in the first half, while Wilfried Zaha, Jason Puncheon and Damien Delaney also went close before Burnley brightened after the break and looked the stronger side in the closing stages. While both sides remain without a Premier League win this season, their work-rate, spirit and attacking intent could not be questioned from the outset. Danny Ings felt he had claims for a penalty in the fourth minute after skipping past Delaney and going to ground on the edge of the box, only to be brandished a yellow card for diving by Dean. Delaney then spurned Palace’s first clear-cut chance, collecting Zaha’s incisive cut-back before turning sharply and firing inches over from 15 yards. A minute later, the home side were denied by the woodwork as Frazier Campbell’s floated cross to the far post picked out Dann, whose header beat Tom Heaton but not the crossbar. Palace then had their own penalty claims waved away by Dean when Jason Shackell misjudged the flight of Puncheon’s cross from the right flank and appeared to bring the ball down with an arm before belting it upfield. Zaha was a constant threat to the visiting defence, and his storming run and shot was parried by Heaton onto Shackell’s shin before the Burnley skipper reacted quickly to hoof the goal-bound ball away to safety. The visitors looked dangerous on the counter-attack and Arfield scooped a half-volley over the bar from Kieran Trippier’s near-post centre, but the visitors then lost the services of Ings after he pulled up clutching his hamstring and limped off to be replaced by Marvin Sordell. Palace went back on the offensive and Puncheon scuffed a disappointing strike straight at Heaton after neat link-up play with Dwight Gayle, who then blazed high and wide after finding himself in acres of space on the edge of the box and rushing his shot. Another flowing Burnley counter-attack presented a chance for George Boyd, but Dann flung himself in front of the shot and diverted the ball behind in the last meaningful action of the opening 45 minutes. Palace continued to look the more likely to break the deadlock after the interval as Gayle came within inches of getting his rainbow laces to Mile Jedinak’s header across goal. Delaney then glanced a near-post header into the side-netting, and Puncheon did likewise from a tight angle after being teed up by a neat chest-down from Campbell. Record signing James McArthur came within 18 inches from marking his Palace debut with a goal, but his rasping 25-yarder was still rising as it disappeared into the Holmesdale Stand. But Sean Dyche roused his troops and they responded by creating their best chance of the game, Arfield given room to roam forward before letting fly with a thundering 20-yard strike that Speroni did well to palm over. The home keeper was forced into action again moments later as he got down sharply to his right to intercept a low drive from David Jones, and the lively Arfield then cut inside Joel Ward only to curl his shot high and wide. Jonny Williams almost made an instant impact after replacing Gayle, but the diminutive Welshman stabbed a hurried effort wide of the post following excellent work from Yannick Bolasie. But with five minutes remaining, Jedinak was adjudged to have wrestled Lukas Jutkiewicz to the floor and referee Dean had no hesitation in awarding the penalty. Up stepped Arfield, whose powerful spot-kick looked destined for the top corner until Speroni launched himself to his right and beat the ball away with a firm left palm, and the alert Palace defender Adrian Mariappa won the race to the loose ball. The home defence comfortably dealt with a pair of late corners, and both sides settled for their second points of the season at the end of a combative contest."},{"date": "13/09/2015", "arena": "

win over Newcastle Two goals from Graziano Pelle gave Southampton a 4-0 win over Newcastle – piling further pressure on Magpies boss Alan Pardew. Pelle opened the scoring after just six minutes, nodding home a cross from Ryan Bertrand which left Newcastle goalkeeper Tim Krul with no chance. Best of the Match Man of the Match: Graziano Pelle was a constant thorn in Newcastle’s side. He finished his chances with aplomb, and was a constant threat in the air too. Goal of the Match: Morgan Schneiderlin’s last-minute goal was a beauty. He picked it up on the edge of the area and bent it wonderfully beyond Tim Krul to complete their rout. Moment of the Match: As soon as Pelle nodded in his first goal after six minutes, Newcastle’s heads dropped. Southampton never looked in danger of losing from that moment. Save of the Match: Fraser Forster pulled off a great save to deny a Yoan Gouffran header in the latter stages of the game. Talking point: Will Newcastle owner Mike Ashley decide to sack Alan Pardew? With the Magpies now bottom of the league, it doesn't look good for the former West Ham boss. Five minutes later, the Saints doubled their lead when the former Feyenoord striker tapped the ball into an empty net following some unselfish work from Dusan Tadic. Less than ten minutes into the second half, Southampton added a third when Jack Cork capitalised on a defensive mix-up between Mike Williamson and Krul, gifting the midfielder the opportunity to stroke the ball into an open goal. In stoppage time, Morgan Schneiderlin picked up the ball in the Newcastle area and curled a sumptuous effort beyond a sprawling Krul to make it 4-0, compounding a miserable afternoon for the travelling Toon Army. The result secures Ronald Koeman's second Premier League win as Southampton boss, but in stark contrast, Pardew's future at Newcastle looks decidedly uncertain after his side's awful performance on the south coast leaves them bottom of the Premier League. A recent poll showed 85 per cent of supporters did not want the Magpies manager to stay, and those dissenting voices were given further ammo by a tepid performance at St Mary's. An angry fan had to be apprehended after running on to the pitch at the end of a game which looked to be going only one way after just 23 seconds. Jack Cork: Celebrates after making it 3-0 Attempting to clear a Fabricio Coloccini backpass, Krul's clearance struck Shane Long but, fortunately for the Newcastle goalkeeper, went wide. It was a warning shot the visitors failed to heed as, after some last-ditch challenges and a penalty appeal from Long, Saints opened the scoring after six minutes. Meeting a Bertrand cross from the left, Pelle, the man charged with replacing talisman Rickie Lambert, impressively powered a header into the top left-hand corner. Moussa Sissoko and Emmanuel Riviere: Dejected after thrashing The Italian was clearly keen to add to his tally and showed impressive inventiveness to hook goalwards from an acute angle, forcing an unorthodox save from Krul. Pelle's second eventually came in the 19th minute, though, courtesy of his own miscued strike. The 29-year-old attempted to volley a Williamson clearance but it went so wide it landed at the feet of Tadic, who ignored offside appeals to square the ball for the frontman to tap home. \"We want Pardew out\" soon echoed around St Mary's, with both sets of fans chanting \"you're getting sacked in the morning\". Ronald Koeman: Praises striker Graziano Pelle Ronald Koeman: Praises striker Graziano Pelle It took 26 minutes for Newcastle to call their former goalkeeper into action and when they did Fraser Forster showed why Saints forked out £10million for his services, denying a close-range, first-time Moussa Sissoko effort. The England international also had to be alert to a fizzing Jack Colback drive as United improved towards the end of the first half, although a deflected Yoan Gouffran effort was the only chance of note they could muster. Cork scored in the recent Capital One Cup tie at Millwall but had failed to net a league goal for Saints over two spells with the club until latching on to a deflected Steven Davis ball, rounding Krul and slotting home. Alan Pardew: Newcastle were 'caught out' Alan Pardew: Newcastle were 'caught out' It was a period in which the visitors came close to scoring on several occasions, with Emmanuel Riviere and Colback somehow failing to turn home before Forster denied a Gouffran header. Florin Gardos joined fellow debutant Toby Alderweireld for the final few minutes, which saw Schneiderlin add extra gloss with a wonderful curling effort in stoppage time. Alan McInally on Southampton v Newcastle Alan Pardew will be punch drunk after watching that. Riviere, Cabella, Janmaat, Gouffran, Anita, the two centre-halves... they were all bang average. Like the Newcastle fans we always think Newcastle are going to be better and they haven’t been. Alan has been banging his head and I know a lot of fans want him out. The way they played today is relegation candidates, big time. There seemed to be no real urgency. I’m talking about fight within a football team, I’m talking about personalities that say ‘hey, come on’.

The hosts had the better of the first half and Peter Crouch came closest to opening the scoring as he headed a Victor Moses corner wide before drilling a ferocious strike inches away from Ben Hamer’s post from outside the area. Pearson looked to change the flow of the game by introducing Danny Drinkwater and debutant Esteban Cambiasso after the interval and it was his side that took the lead on 64 minutes against the run of play. Best of the Match: Man of the Match: Introduced at half-time, debutant Esteban Cambiasso showed his class in midfield and brought an instant air of composure to Leicester’s play.

Ben Hamer was also making his Premier League debut for the Foxes and he made a crucial last-gasp save to smother at the feet of Victor Moses.

In the build-up to Ulloa’s winner, referee Michael Oliver played the advantage after Glenn Whelan’s foul on Ritchie De Laet as Leicester broke up-field. Effort of the Match: Peter Crouch posed a major threat – particularly in the first half – and he almost added another acrobatic volley to his collection, steering Glenn Whelan’s cross over. A swift counter-attack saw the ball spread to veteran full-back Paul Konchesky on the left and he delivered a low cross towards the back post where £8million man Ulloa was waiting to steer beyond Asmir Begovic. Stoke pushed forward in search of an equaliser, but Leicester stood firm amid waves of late pressure as Hamer denied substitute Mame Biram Diouf before smothering at the feet of Moses. Hamer was making his Premier League bow after Kasper Schmeichel suffered a knee injury on international duty, bringing to an end the Dane's run of 141 consecutive league starts. Stoke's match-winner last time out against Manchester City, Diouf, was on the bench after a lengthy international trip with Senegal, so Bojan Krkic came into the starting line-up. The game had barely got started when there was a lengthy stoppage after Ryan Shawcross and Jeffrey Schlupp accidentally clashed heads. The Stoke skipper came off worse and played on with a bandage wrapped around his forehead. After a fairly quiet opening, the hosts began to exert more pressure on Hamer's goal, with Steven N'Zonzi the first to try his luck, but the midfielder's impressive run was not matched by his finish. Probably the best chance of the half fell to Crouch in the 18th minute, when he was picked out by Moses from a corner but could only head wide from eight yards. Leicester did not manage their first meaningful effort until the 27th minute, when Andy King let fly from 20 yards. Begovic dived but the ball was always going wide of the far post. Nigel Pearson expresses his delight after Leicester's 1-0 win at Stoke Nigel Pearson expresses his delight after Leicester's 1-0 win at Stoke Crouch then almost added another to his collection of spectacular goals with an acrobatic volley from Glenn Whelan's cross that flew just over the bar. The former England man was in the mood and had Hamer scrambling in the 38th minute with an effort that just missed the far post. Leicester had been outplayed in the first half, even if the score did not reflect that, and boss Pearson made two changes for the second half. Cambiasso, who last season made 32 appearances for Inter Milan, replaced King while Drinkwater came on for the largely ineffectual Riyad Mahrez. Cambiasso and Bojan found themselves on opposite sides again having met twice in Milan derbies in the 2012/13 Serie A season. Bojan had been neat and tidy without making too much impact, but he showed good feet in the 52nd minute to create a shooting opportunity, only to direct his effort straight at Hamer. Mark Hughes was frustrated with the home defeat for his Stoke City side Mark Hughes was frustrated with the home defeat for his Stoke City side Cambiasso's presence certainly seemed to help Leicester take more control of the game, and they got their reward in the 64th minute. Ulloa and Drinkwater combined to tee up Konchesky on the left, whose cross was guided home by the Argentinian striker. It was a decent finish from Ulloa, who had to adjust and pull the ball back from behind him. Stoke responded immediately and Bojan appealed after appearing to be tripped from behind right on the edge of the area, but referee Michael Oliver waved play on. The Potters continued to create plenty of half-chances but the ball just would not fall for them, while Leicester defended manfully. Diouf made his entrance in the 74th minute in place of Bojan while Jamie Vardy replaced Schlupp. Stoke were beginning to leave gaps at the back and, after Drinkwater was denied by a combination of Begovic and two defenders, Dean Hammond saw his fierce effort fly just past the post. Oussama Assaidi made his second Stoke debut on loan from Liverpool with eight minutes remaining but the Potters could not find a leveller as Hamer came to his side's rescue in the 90th minute with crucial saves first from Diouf and then Moses."},{"date": "13/09/2015", "arena": "Stadium of Light", "attendance": 40799, "home_team": {"name": "Sunderland", "lineup": [{"name": "Vito Mannone",

Tottenham led twice through goals at the start of each half from Nacer Chadli and Christian Eriksen, but were pegged back by Adam Johnson's solo effort and substitute Kane's late own goal. Spurs will be left to rue dropping two points after dominating most of the game and twice striking the woodwork as Sunderland earned their third draw of the season. Best of the game Man of the match: Moussa Dembele - The Belgian was impressive in midfield as Tottenham dominated the majority of the game Moment of the match: Harry Kane's unfortunate own goal gifted Sunderland a point in a game Tottenham really should have won. Goal of the match: Adam Johnson gets the nod for his jinking run in the box past a couple of challenges even though his shot took a slight deflection to beat Hugo Lloris. Attempt of the match: Dembele was unlucky not to score with a stunning strike from fully 30 yards which came back off the post with Vito Mannone rooted to the spot. Miss of the match: Will Buckley should have scored late on after being teed by Patrick van Aanholt, but struck his shot over the crossbar. Talking point: Do Sunderland need to be more attacking at home if they are steer clear of trouble this season? Tottenham will be left to rue two dropped points and should they have brought in a new striker on deadline day to finish off their chances? The visitors came flying out of the blocks and went close to scoring in the first minute as Eriksen slipped in Danny Rose inside the box and he fired in a shot which was pushed away by Vito Mannone. Mauricio Pochettino's side did not have to wait long to break the deadlock as a minute later Emmanuel Adebayor fired in a shot from the edge of the box which was parried out by Mannone and Chadli reacted quickest to fire home the loose ball. The lead proved short-lived as within two minutes Sunderland drew level with their first attack of the game through Johnson. The winger cut in from the left past a couple of Spurs challenges and fired in a shot which went through a couple of Spurs bodies to evade Hugo Lloris in the Tottenham goal and Rose on the line. Tottenham almost restored their lead straight away as Chadli cut in from the left and curled in a shot which was well saved by Mannone. The visitors looked dangerous every time they went forward in the opening exchanges and Adebayor should have scored on seven minutes when he latched onto Eriksen's clever lofted pass only to see his point-blank volley kept out by the body of Mannone. Tottenham dominated the first half and were inches away from regaining the lead on 38 minutes when Mousa Dembele let fly from fully 30 yards and was unlucky to see his shot come back off the post with Mannone stranded in the Sunderland goal. Tottenham picked up where they left off at the start of the second half and grabbed the lead for the second time on 48 minutes when Patrick van Aanholt's clearance from Chadli's cross bounced off Wes Brown and fell to Eriksen inside the six-yard box and he stabbed the ball home from close range. Erik Lamela was inches away from adding to Tottenham's lead on 74 minutes with his first Premier League goal when his curling shot from the edge of the box came back off the crossbar. Sunderland were gifted a way back into the game eight minutes from time as substitute Jordi Gomez fired over a free-kick from the left and Vlad Chiriches' clearance cannoned off Kane and into the net. The home side almost won it a minute from time when van Aanholt burst down the left and cut the ball back for Will Buckley on the penalty spot, but the winger lifted his shot over the

former loan employers Two defensive errors from hosts West Bromwich Albion helped Everton to prevail 2-0 at The Hawthorns and collect their first win of the season. Romelu Lukaku’s stunning early strike against his former loan club and a hopeful drive from Kevin Mirallas wrapped up the points for Roberto Martinez’s side and forced ex-Goodison Park coach Alan Irvine back to the drawing board. Best of the match Man of the match: Kevin Mirallas. Caused plenty of problems and was flying around the time of his goal. Goal of the match: Romelu Lukaku’s spectacular opener saw him start the ball wide of the post and bend it back around Ben Foster. Howler of the match: Foster will have nightmares about how he allowed a tame low drive from Mirallas to slip through his grasp. Save of the match: Tim Howard produced a stunning double stop late on as he first denied Saido Berahino and bounced back up to parry away a volley from Georgios Samaras. Talking point: Have West Brom got enough about them to steer clear of trouble? What can Everton achieve this season now that they are up and running? In just the second minute, Jonas Olsson scuffed a clearance to the edge of the box and Lukaku curled a sumptuous effort around Ben Foster and into the corner of the net. Everton were rattled at times as they looked to secure a first clean sheet and three-point haul of the campaign, but they made the result safe on 66 minutes as Mirallas sent in an ambitious effort which somehow slipped under the body of a red-faced Foster. Recruits Foster had shrugged off a thumb problem which forced him out of England duty to start, while James Morrison made his first league start of the season, replacing the injured Youssouf Mulumbu for West Brom. Stephane Sessegnon was ruled out with blurred vision after taking a ball in the face during training on Friday. Joleon Lescott failed to make the squad, despite returning to full training after a knee injury, while fellow summer recruits Georgios Samaras and Sebastian Blanco made the bench. Everton made one change from their 6-3 defeat by Chelsea with John Stones replacing Sylvain Distin at the back. And the visitors were ahead after just one minute and 40 seconds as Lukaku seized on a mistake from Olsson. John Stones: Put in another impressive display The defender's awful clearance fell straight to the striker who beautifully curled past Foster from 18 yards. It was Lukaku's first Everton goal since making a permanent move from Chelsea but he was apologetic in his celebrations, having spent the 2012/13 season on loan at The Hawthorns. Restless Albion tried to respond and Saido Berahino's effort was deflected over as, with the home fans restless, they began to dominate. There were brief signs of a blossoming partnership between Brown Ideye and Berahino but, for all their bluster, the hosts lacked the quality to seriously threaten Everton. Chris Brunt hit the side netting and Berahino's shot deflected wide after 33 minutes but Tim Howard remained untroubled. Everton's threat was minimal but Mirallas warned of what was to come when he fired over from 25 yards eight minutes before the break. Lukaku followed suit in first-half injury time and Naismith should have made it 2-0 five minutes after the break. I don’t think the fans are helping West Brom at the moment. They were on the players’ backs very, very quickly. They were 1-0 down in two minutes and what a goal it was. Then you’re up against it when you haven’t won all season. The fans were straight on Olsson’s back every time he touched it and they were on Brunt’s back as well. When he got substituted was probably the biggest cheer of the day. For me, that’s’ not on. He’s one of the best players and the captain. I worry for West Brom. Today they didn’t look right. Paul Merson Foster's fine low save from Lukaku presented the Scotland striker with a gaping goal six yards out, only for him to balloon over. It was a huge let-off for the Baggies but one they did not heed. Comfortable Everton grew increasingly comfortable with the hosts' predictable attacks and doubled their lead following another howler from Albion after 66 minutes. Mirallas' tame effort from 25 yards out should have been easy for Foster but the England keeper allowed it to creep under his body. From then it was easy for the visitors and Aiden McGeady shot wide on 73 minutes as the fight left the Baggies. Samaras and Blanco made their debuts but could not make the difference and Foster saved well from Leon Osman to deny Everton a third. The keeper thwarted the midfielder again on 88 minutes with a fine low stop after a sweeping Toffees move cut the hosts apart. And the underemployed Howard had the final say when he denied Berahino and Samaras a consolation in injury time."},{"date": "13/09/2015", "arena": "Anfield", "attendance": 44689, "home_team": {"name": "Liverpool", "lineup": [{"name": "Simon Mignolet", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Javi Manquillo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dejan Lovren", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mamadou Sakho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alberto Moreno", "yellows": [76], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Gerrard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordan Henderson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lazar Markovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [71]}, {"name": "Philippe Coutinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Lallana", "yellows": [12], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [61]}, {"name": "Mario Balotelli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [71]}], "subs": [{"name": "Brad Jones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jose Enrique", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kolo Touré", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rickie Lambert", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [71], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lucas Leiva", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fabio Borini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [71], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Raheem Sterling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [61], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Aston Villa", "lineup": [{"name": "Brad Guzan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alan Hutton", "yellows": [63], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Philippe Senderos", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathan Baker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aly Cissokho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Cleverley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [86]}, {"name": "Ashley Westwood", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fabian Delph", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gabriel Agbonlahor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Andreas Weimann", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [72]}, {"name": "Kieran  Richardson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Jores Okore", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leandro Bacuna", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Darren Bent", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Carlos Sánchez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [86], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charles N'Zogbia", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [72], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shay Given", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Grealish", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Liverpool suffered a shock 1-0 home defeat at the hands of a determined Aston Villa side as Gabriel Agbonlahor scored the only goal at Anfield. Villa struck in just the ninth minute as Philippe Senderos got in front of Dejan Lovren to meet Ashley Westwood’s corner, with Agbonlahor pouncing in the six-yard box to poke the ball home. Best of the match: Man of the match: Nathan Baker. Brought in to replace the injured Ron Vlaar and was outstanding alongside Philippe Senderos. Moment of the match: Senderos got away with some questionable treatement of Mario Balotelli, with one first-half trip particularly blatant. Miss of the match: Senderos should have at least tested Simon Mignolet with a free header after Ashley Westwood’s free-kick, but only found the Kop. Talking points: How will Liverpool cope in Daniel Sturridge’s absence? Can Aston Villa build on this excellent start to the season? From that point on, Paul Lambert’s men defended in superb fashion with Senderos and Nathan Baker excellent as they repelled everything Liverpool had to throw at them. Brendan Rodgers’ side never really tested Brad Guzan in a limp attacking display, with the closest they came to levelling coming when Philippe Coutinho hit the post and substitute Raheem Sterling fired the follow-up against Jordan Henderson. Villa are now up to second in the table after an excellent start to the season, but Rodgers has much to ponder ahead of their UEFA Champions League return. With Daniel Sturridge sidelined for up to three weeks with a thigh injury - for which Rodgers has still not forgiven England - it meant Liverpool started a game without him or Luis Suarez, a summer departure to Barcelona, for the first time since December 2012. Last season the pair scored 56 league goals between them so it was immediately apparent where the Reds were most likely to be under the greatest strain. Lambert knew this, and also the fact their opponents have still not entirely cracked defending set-pieces, and that was what he targeted. Liverpool were denied space in the final third which stifled much of their forward progress, while the visitors attacked with speed when they had the chance and were aggressive at corners and free-kicks - which ultimately produced their winner. Mario Balotelli was brought in by Rodgers last month to provide additional firepower but he spent much of the first half either being kicked or trying to avoid being kicked by Senderos. The Swiss defender got away with at least one blatant hack at the former Manchester City striker off the ball which would have likely resulted in a card had referee Lee Mason or either of his linesmen seen it. Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers said his side started too slow in their 0-1 defeat to Aston Villa. Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers said his side started too slow in their 0-1 defeat to Aston Villa. Whether it knocked Balotelli, making his home debut, off his stride or not it was the latter stages of the half before he started to show signs of life with one viciously-dipping shot with the aid of a deflection off Andreas Weimann dropping just wide of the post. He also created a good chance for Adam Lallana, making his debut after injury in pre-season delayed his first appearance since a summer move, but the former Southampton midfielder drilled a half-volley just wide from Balotelli's lay-off on the edge of the area. By that time Liverpool were already behind after mistakes by their two centre-backs. Aston Villa boss Paul Lambert said the hard work his players but in paid off against Liverpool after they left Anfield with a 1-0 win. Aston Villa boss Paul Lambert said the hard work his players but in paid off against Liverpool after they left Anfield with a 1-0 win. First Mamadou Sakho tried to control the ball close to his own goalline instead of playing safe and ended up conceding a corner, from which Lovren got the wrong side of Senderos whose header created a scramble from which Agbonlahor scored in the ninth minute. The goal was against the run of play as Lazar Markovic, also making his first Anfield appearance, had already volleyed over Alberto Moreno's far-post cross and headed wide after being involved in good build-up play with Henderson and Javier Manquillo. While Lallana was deservedly booked for a late challenge on Tom Cleverley, making his debut after a deadline day loan move from Manchester United, Mason missed Senderos' kick at Balotelli and chose to take no action after Alan Hutton appeared to rake his studs down the Italian's knee. Gabriel Agbonlahor gave Aston Villa a shock 1-0 win against Liverpool at Anfield. Gabriel Agbonlahor gave Aston Villa a shock 1-0 win against Liverpool at Anfield. Senderos could have rubbed further salt into the wound but headed a free-kick over when well placed and then blasted wide from close range at another corner. Balotelli had the first chance of the second half, heading wide Steven Gerrard's corner. Sterling's introduction, having been rested after international duty, on the hour raised the temperature a notch or two with Hutton booked for scything down the youngster within seconds of his arrival. Villa's plan to smother Liverpool continued to work, however, and even the introduction of Rickie Lambert and Fabio Borini for Balotelli and Markovic failed to produce the chances needed to rescue a point. The closest they came was when Coutinho bent a shot around goalkeeper Guzan only for it to rebound back off the post as Villa left Anfield having taken their tally to eight points from their last four visits."},{"date": "31/08/2015", "arena": "Villa Park", "attendance": 28336, "home_team": {"name": "Aston Villa", "lineup": [{"name": "Brad Guzan", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alan Hutton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Philippe Senderos", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ron Vlaar", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aly Cissokho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kieran  Richardson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [75]}, {"name": "Ashley Westwood", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fabian Delph", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charles N'Zogbia", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [64]}, {"name": "Andreas Weimann", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gabriel Agbonlahor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [85]}], "subs": [{"name": "Nathan Baker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leandro Bacuna", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Cole", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Darren Bent", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [85], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Carlos Sánchez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [64], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shay Given", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Grealish", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [75], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Hull City", "lineup": [{"name": "Allan McGregor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paul McShane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Dawson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Curtis Davies", "yellows": [42], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Ahmed Elmohamady", "yellows": [84], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jake Livermore", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Huddlestone", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [71]}, {"name": "Stephen Quinn", "yellows": [87], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andrew Robertson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nikica Jelavic", "yellows": [82], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Ince", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [57]}], "subs": [{"name": "Liam Rosenior", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex Bruce", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Meyler", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robbie Brady", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [57], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yannick Sagbo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steve Harper", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sone Aluko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [71], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Aston Villa moved up to third in the early Premier League table with a 2-1 win over Hull City at Villa Park.

Shot of the match: Jake Livermore hit a fine strike from the edge of the box which drew a finger-tip save from Brad Guzan to push the ball over. Save of the match: As above – Guzan from Livermore. Talking point: It was a good win for Villa ahead of a tough run of games in the league. Hull looked sluggish for much of the game and going out of Europe in mid-week could be a blessing in disguise ahead of a long season. Ashley Westwood put a free-kick onto the bar just before the break as a dominant Villa went in two goals to the good. Hull improved after the break and Nikica Jelavic pulled a goal back with 16 minutes remaining after his header at goal from a free-kick hit Aly Cissokho. This set up a nervy finish for the hosts but Paul Lambert's side held on to maintain their unbeaten start to the Premier League campaign. Villa had the look of a crisis club towards the end of the 2013-14 campaign, with manager Lambert under intense pressure, owner Randy Lerner trying to sell the club and internal discord rife, but seven points from a possible nine paints a rosier picture this time around. Villa had to settle for a 2-1 victory but should really have enjoyed a more handsome scoreline, dominating first-half proceedings completely. Hull were abject in those 45 minutes, arguably as bad as they have been since their return to the top flight, but tightened up after the interval and found a lifeline via Jelavic's header. Both sides had been responding to midweek setbacks, Lambert's side beaten by Leyton Orient in the Capital One Cup and the Tigers ousted from the Europa League on away goals. Each made seven changes from those games and there was little doubt about which side settled quicker. Villa's dominance began almost immediately, with just 90 seconds gone when Delph latched on to Weimann's pass and lashed an angled shot against the outside of the near post. That energetic start appeared to catch the visitors cold and they regressed immediately to some uncharacteristic long balls. Lambert's side attacked with more forethought, Delph, Weimann and Agbonlahor looking to use their pace against a Hull defence including debutant Dawson. The opener arrived shortly before the quarter-hour mark, Jelavic mis-controlling a pass back into his own half to set up a Villa break. Within seconds the ball was in the net, Charles N'Zogbia finding Weimann, whose deft touch gave Agbonlahor just enough room to turn and shoot low past Allan McGregor from 10 yards. A second almost followed within two minutes, Curtis Davies gifting possession to Agbonlahor, who fizzed a cross into the six-yard box where Dawson made a hurried clearance. Briefly threatened Tactics spot on - Agbonlahor Tactics spot on - Agbonlahor Hull briefly threatened a response around the half-hour mark, Tom Huddlestone's free-kick deflected wide by Weimann before Mark Clattenburg waved away penalty appeals for a Westwood handball. Villa soon regained control, though, aided by some dreadful resistance. They doubled their lead in the 36th minute when Dawson's loose ball was won by Delph, spread wide to Richardson and finished in two succinct touches by Weimann. It was a moment to forget for the Hull debutant but another clinical reaction by Villa's forward line. It might easily have been three before half-time, Agbonlahor denied by McGregor's feet and Westwood curling a free-kick against the upright with McGregor nowhere. Villa deserved win - Lambert Villa deserved win - Lambert Hull captain Davies did not emerge for the second half, replaced by Liam Rosenior to force a change of shape to four at the back. Ten minutes later and with no sign of a change in momentum, Steve Bruce made his second change. This time Tom Ince, nearly anonymous in his attempts to link midfield and attack, gave way for Robbie Brady, fresh from two goals against Lokeren on Thursday. Lambert's first change came soon after, Carlos Sanchez on for N'Zogbia, and if the substitutions were contributing to an increasingly disjointed feeling then it hardly mattered to the side with a two-goal cushion. That almost increased to three when McGregor slipped fielding Dawson's back pass, but the ball did not fall for the harrying Weimann. Then, against all expectations, Hull instigated a tense finale by grabbing a lifeline 16 minutes from time. The lively Brady was involved, his drifting free-kick headed goalwards by Jelavic only for Cissokho to wrong-foot his own goalkeeper with a deflection. In an instant the game had a new spark, Delph bringing the home fans back to their feet with a fine run and shot before Jake Livermore took aim at the other end. His strike from the edge of the box was destined for the top corner but Brad Guzan made his first save of the match a crucial one. Both sides had chances in injury-time, substitute Darren Bent dragging wide from a good position and fellow replacement Sone Aluko firing directly at Guzan with the visitors' final chance."},{"date":

Goal of the match: Alberto Moreno robbed Andros Townsend inside his own half and surged forward on a fast run before driving a powerful low shot into the far corner. Save of the match: Simon Mignolet pulled off a terrific save from Nacer Chadli near the end of the first half, when the scoreline was 1-0 to Liverpool. Talking point: Will Mario Balotelli be a success for Liverpool? Does this game show it is still soon to speak of Tottenham as top-four contenders? Sturridge played through Henderson, whose low, driven cross was turned in at the back post by Sterling - a team goal which will have no doubt pleased watching England manager Roy Hodgson. Emmanuel Adebayor had a decent chance to level almost immediately when put through by Nabil Bentaleb, only for him to lift the ball onto the roof of the net. It was a rare moment of respite as Liverpool toyed with the hosts, wasting several decent chances to pull further ahead. Sturridge wriggled free to strike a low left-footed effort just wide, before Balotelli wasted another gilt-edged chance when failing to head on target despite being left unmarked from a Gerrard free-kick. Adebayor was proving a nuisance as Spurs began to settle, although a wayward effort from Danny Rose was all they had to show for their improved performance. They were still looking shaky on occasion at the back and Lloris was fortunate not to be punished for a rush of blood to the head. Gerrard and Sterling reaction Gerrard and Sterling reaction Soon after saving a Sturridge pot shot, the French goalkeeper, like so many times before, burst off his line to make an interception, which he put straight at Balotelli - a chance the Italian snatched at, screwing wide of the open goal. Balotelli was guilty of firing wildly over from a corner just before the break, which Spurs were close to going into level. Adebayor showed good strength to flick the ball through to Chadli, although the attacker's goalbound drive was denied by Mignolet. Rodgers: Reds exceptional Rodgers: Reds exceptional Spurs were fortunate not to be further behind at the break but Liverpool did double their advantage four minutes into the second half. Dier was adjudged to have pulled back Allen in the box, with Gerrard striking home the resulting penalty - a record 43rd successive spot-kick for Liverpool. It looked a soft decision by referee Phil Dowd and one which led Mauricio Pochettino to make alterations, although the introduction of Townsend immediately cost Spurs. Pochettino: We must learn Pochettino: We must learn The dawdling winger was dispossessed by Moreno just inside the Liverpool half, with the left-back powering down the flank before letting fly across Lloris. Balotelli was withdrawn after the Spaniard's fine solo effort, which would have been usurped as the game's best goal had the final touch matched the quality of Sterling's inspired, mazy run. Lloris denied that tame effort and a low Sturridge strike as the tempo slowed and game petered out. There was a worrying moment for Hodgson as Rose was replaced after picking up a knock towards the end of a match which Spurs underwhelmed."},{"date": "31/08/2015", "arena": "The King Power Stadium", "attendance": 31535, "home_team": {"name": "Leicester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Kasper Schmeichel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ritchie de Laet", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wes Morgan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Liam Moore", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paul Konchesky", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Riyad Mahrez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [64]}, {"name": "Dean Hammond", "yellows": [85], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andy King", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jeffrey Schlupp", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [70]}, {"name": "Leonardo Ulloa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [77]}, {"name": "David Nugent", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Danny Drinkwater", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [77], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jamie Vardy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [70], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marc Albrighton", "yellows": [84], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [64], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Hamer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Esteban Cambiasso", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marcin Wasilewski", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Wood", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Arsenal", "lineup": [{"name": "Wojciech Szczesny", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mathieu Debuchy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Per Mertesacker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Laurent Koscielny", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [26]}, {"name": "Nacho Monreal", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mathieu Flamini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alexis Sánchez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Ramsey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Santi Cazorla", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [77]}, {"name": "Mesut Özil", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yaya Sanogo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [77]}], "subs": [{"name": "Tomas Rosicky", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lukas Podolski", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [77], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Wilshere", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [77], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Calum Chambers", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [26], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Emiliano Martinez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joel Campbell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Premier League new-boys Leicester City came from behind to earn a deserved 1-1 draw with Arsenal at the King Power Stadium. Big-money signing Leo Ulloa cancelled out Alexis Sanchez's first-half opener for Arsenal to secure a share of the spoils for the hosts on Sunday. Watch the Super Sunday analysis Watch the Super Sunday analysis Arsenal created the better of the chances in the second half, but substitute Jamie Vardy went close to winning it for Leicester only to be denied by Wojciech Szczesny. The Gunners suffered a scare early on when Laurent Koscielny came off worse after a clash of heads with Jeffrey Schlupp and was forced off the pitch to receive lengthy treatment. Leicester created their first chance of the game on 18 minutes when Riyad Mahrez worked a one-two with Ulloa and fired in a shot just wide of the far post. Best of match Man of the match: Wes Morgan was a rock for Leicester at the back. Goal of the match: Leo Ulloa powered home a superb header from Jeffrey Schlupp's brilliant cross. Save of the match: Wojiech Szczesny was at full stretch to push out substitute Jamie Vardy's powerful shot Moment of the match: Laurent Koscielny picked up a head injury early on and it appeared to affect him in his positioning for the equaliser. Talking point: Have Leicester got enough to claw their way to safety? Do Arsenal need to bring in a new striker if they are to challenge for the title? Two minutes later, Arsenal broke the deadlock as Santi Cazorla found Yaya Sanogo inside the box with a clever pass and after the striker saw his stabbed effort blocked by Kasper Schmeichel, Sanchez was on hand to fire home the loose ball from six yards. The lead proved short-lived as Leicester drew level two minutes later with Ulloa netting his second goal for the club after his arrival from Brighton in the summer. Schlupp was the provider with a superb cross from the left and Ulloa ghosted in behind Koscielny to power his header high into the net past Szczesny. Morgan and Ulloa reaction Morgan and Ulloa reaction Five minutes later, Koscielny was forced off to be replaced by Calum Chambers as he had failed to recover from the head knock he sustained early in the game. Mahrez was proving a constant threat to Arsenal and he had the final chance of the first half when he drilled in a shot from the edge of the box which forced Szczesny into a good save. Arsenal created the first opening of the second half when Cazorla swapped passes with Sanchez on the edge of the box, but the Spaniard got his left-footed shot all wrong dragging it well wide of the target. Pearson hails Foxes' creativity Pearson hails Foxes' creativity Leicester really should have grabbed the lead on 53 minutes following some superb skill from Ulloa inside the box, which saw him escape Chambers with a brilliant dummy, but with only Szczesny to beat, the striker hit his shot into the side-netting. Aaron Ramsey wasted a good opportunity for Arsenal two minutes later when Cazorla picked out his run with a brilliant lofted pass over the Leicester defence, but the midfielder failed to get enough power on his header to trouble Schmeichel. Wenger: Draw a fair result Wenger: Draw a fair result Sanogo went close for Arsenal soon after when he was played in on goal by Nacho Monreal, but Schmeichel was quickly off his line to block the striker's effort. Leicester substitute Jamie Vardy went close to a winner for the home side seven minutes from time when worked a one-two with Dave Nugent to race into the box and fired in a shot which forced a superb flying save from Szczesny.

United included record signing Angel di Maria in their starting line-up, but rarely looked like scoring at Turf Moor as Burnley picked up a first point since returning to the top flight. Best of the match Man of the match: Dean Marney. Gave everything for the cause and made sure Burnley had the upper hand in midfield. Moment of the match: Ashley Young hit a very late shot which struck Burnley substitute Ashley Barnes in the box, but the frantic penalty appeals from the visitors were waved away by Chris Foy. Attempt of the match: David Jones hit the United crossbar with a curling free-kick that had keeper David de Gea beaten. Save of the match: Burnley’s Tom Heaton made a great stop to keep out a stinging first-half shot from Robin van Persie. Talking point: United’s frustrations continue and much will depend on record signing Angel di Maria adapting quickly to like in the Premier League as he showed glimpses of skill. Former United youngster David Jones almost gave Burnley a third-minute lead when the midfielder curled a 25-yard free-kick against the crossbar, with David de Gea rooted to the spot. Another ex-Red Devil then kept the scores level as Burnley goalkeeper Tom Heaton produced a fine reaction stop on 15 minutes to keep out Robin van Persie’s well-struck shot. New boy Di Maria was one of the few bright sparks for United on his debut as chances were at a premium before Van Persie saw a second-half effort blocked on the line by Dean Marney. Di Maria was replaced with 20 minutes to go after appearing to take a kick to his calf and Wayne Rooney headed wide at the far post from a corner. United appealed for a penalty late on when a shot from Ashley Young, who also appealed in vain for a spot-kick in the first half, clattered into Ashley Barnes, but Van Gaal’s side had never looked like getting their season up and running following previous setbacks against Swansea and Sunderland. Di Maria, playing in a midfield three alongside Juan Mata and a slightly deeper Darren Fletcher, received a hero's welcome from the away fans as he took to the pitch, but he was marginalised early on as Burnley took control from the off. With less than three minutes gone, United handed the hosts a good chance to score and they almost took it when Phil Jones barged over Lukas Jutkiewicz to earn a free-kick right on the edge of the box. David Jones beat De Gea with a curling effort from the resulting set-piece, but the ball struck the bar and bounced out to safety. Soon after Burnley were gifted their second opportunity when Jonny Evans, in an almost identical error to the one he committed at MK Dons on Tuesday, sold De Gea short with a backpass, but the Spaniard came out to block Jutkiewicz's shot. Di Maria then produced his first bit of magic to spark United into life. The Argentinian lofted a 40-yard ball over the top of the home defence and Van Persie cushioned the ball perfectly on his chest, but his volley was well saved by Heaton De Gea was called into action again, racing out of his box to clear just in time after a defensive mix-up before he parried a swirling volley from Jones shortly after watching Scott Arfield head over from close range. Any hopes of a United goal seemed to rest on Di Maria's shoulders. The former Real Madrid midfielder kept the Burnley back four on their toes with his pace and trickery on the attack and he was also proving effective from deep. Di Maria picked out Rooney with another long diagonal ball. The United and England captain prodded the ball to Van Persie, but Jason Shackell intervened. Fletcher, looking increasingly isolated in midfield, was booked for tugging Danny Ings' shirt. United started to come into the game a bit more towards the end of the first half and Young went down in the box under pressure from Kieran Trippier, but Chris Foy waved play on. After a dull opening five minutes of the second half, United created a couple of good chances, but once again they could not find the net. Marney saved Van Persie's shot on the line after a good run from Di Maria and the Dutchman spurned another chance soon after by heading Fletcher's chipped pass onto the roof of the net. Then came a sight no United fan wanted to see - Di Maria down on the floor holding his right leg. The player got back to his feet after treatment, but moments later Van Gaal took his record signing off and replaced him with Anderson. Van Persie was then replaced by Danny Welbeck up front. United's lack of concentration at the back remained Van Gaal's biggest worry, as Antonio Valencia carelessly played the ball straight to the unmarked Arfield on the edge of his own box, but he failed to beat De Gea. At the other end Mata, who was having a day to forget, ploughed the ball high and wide before the Spaniard came off for Adnan Januzaj with four minutes to go. In the dying stages United thought they should have had a penalty when Young's shot appeared to hit Barnes' arm, but Foy was not interested and the game petered out into a draw."},{"date": "30/08/2015", "arena": "Etihad Stadium", "attendance": 45622, "home_team": {"name": "Manchester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Joe Hart", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bacary Sagna", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Vincent Kompany", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martín Demichelis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aleksandar Kolarov", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Samir Nasri", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [63]}, {"name": "Fernando", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [38]}, {"name": "Yaya Touré", "yellows": [87], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Silva", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stevan Jovetic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [63]}, {"name": "Sergio Agüero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Pablo Zabaleta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Milner", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Edin Dzeko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [63], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willy Caballero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jesus Navas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [63], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gael Clichy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fernandinho", "yellows": [53], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [38], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Stoke City", "lineup": [{"name": "Asmir Begovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Bardsley", "yellows": [22], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Shawcross", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marc Wilson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Erik Pieters", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jon Walters", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Glenn Whelan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven N'Zonzi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Moses", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [80]}, {"name": "Mame Biram Diouf", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Peter Crouch", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Peter Odemwingie", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": [65]}, {"name": "Robert Huth", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marc Muniesa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [80], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marko Arnautovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charlie Adam", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [65], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bojan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Thomas Sorensen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Manchester City's title defence suffered its first setback as Mame Biram Diouf's goal gave Stoke a shock 1-0 away win. It was Stoke's first Premier League victory at a Manchester club and the first time they had kept a clean sheet on their top-flight travels since December, as Mark Hughes enjoyed a memorable day out at his former Etihad Stadium stomping ground. His side rise to ninth in the table after three games, while the hosts drop to fourth spot. Best of the Match Man of the Match: Ryan Shawcross. A colossal display from the Stoke skipper, giving an exercise in how to marshal a defence. He should be given another England chance. Goal of the Match: There was only one, but Mame Biram Diouf – a Manchester United player from 2009 to 2012 – will dine out on it for a while. City couldn’t stop his solo run and he slid the ball home confidently, even if Joe Hart put up little resistance. Moment of the Match: TV replays suggested Stoke should have a penalty after 19 minutes when Aleksandar Kolarov brought down Diouf just inside the area. The Potters felt hard done by - but they got their reward in the end. Talking Point: Do City need another attacking option to retain the title? They have again been linked with Falcao. Or perhaps you just have to hand it to rock-solid Stoke on this occasion… At the break, the Potters felt aggrieved about referee Lee Mason's failure to give them a penalty on 19 minutes, when Aleksandar Kolarov - one of three changes to the side made by Manuel Pellegrini after the 3-1 win over Liverpool on Monday - appeared to foul Diouf in the box. Fernando had to limp off injured on 38 minutes, to be replaced by Fernandinho, and then Yaya Toure hit the crossbar from close range in stoppage time. The only goal of the game arrived on 58 minutes. Picking up the ball after Erik Pieters' clearing header, Diouf dribbled down the centre of the pitch, nutmegged Fernandinho and took the ball on into the area before sliding home a low shot through keeper Joe Hart, who should have done better. That was the former Manchester United striker's first goal for the Potters. The champions threw on Edin Dzeko and Jesus Navas as they went in hunt of an equaliser, but it was Diouf who soon went close to a second goal as he narrowly failed to connect with sub Peter Odemwingie's right-wing cross. Sergio Aguero saw an optimistic handball appeal turned down, Peter Crouch headed wide at the other end and Toure was booked for diving after going down in the box after a Pieters challenge as Stoke held on to record their first league win away to Manchester City since 1980. Pellegrini brought in Bacary Sagna for his debut as well as Kolarov and Aguero, while Stoke included Victor Moses, Crouch and Jonathan Walters. Aguero seemed set for a rough afternoon as he was hurt in a heavy tackle from Ryan Shawcross and required treatment after just two minutes. Reaction from Stoke goal hero Diouf Reaction from Stoke goal hero Diouf Stoke created the first serious opportunity when Steven Nzonzi broke, but the Frenchman failed to keep his composure and blazed well over. Sagna cut the ball back for Samir Nasri to test Asmir Begovic with City's first opportunity. The Frenchman also showed his ability in defence with a well-timed challenge on Moses but, on the opposite flank, Kolarov was caught out and lucky not to concede a penalty. The Serbian was wrong-footed by Diouf and then appeared to trip the Senegal forward on the edge of the area. Diouf appealed to referee Mason, but the official hardly seemed to give the incident a moment's thought. Toure shot over as City pieced together a good move but play was held up after an off-the-ball tussle between Stevan Jovetic and Shawcross. The pair squared up to each other but Mason, City captain Vincent Kompany and Stoke goalkeeper Begovic stepped in. Hughes credits Stoke gameplan Hughes credits Stoke gameplan City were forced into a change when midfielder Fernando, impressive in his first few appearances for the club, seemed to injure his groin. Fellow Brazilian Fernandinho was his ready-made replacement. City produced their best attack of the first half just before the break when Aguero's backheel fed Kolarov and his cross was clipped against the woodwork by Toure. Nasri went close to opening the scoring soon after the restart but Phil Bardsley made a timely intervention to deflect his effort narrowly wide. City appeared to have stepped up a gear and Toure extended Begovic as he met a Nasri cross with a well-struck shot. Stoke were not rattled, however, and took the lead in exhilarating fashion just before the hour as Diouf started a breakaway from inside his own half. He touched the ball past Kolarov, outpaced Fernandinho to reach the area and then slid a cool shot through Hart's legs as well. Pellegrini left disappointed Pellegrini left disappointed It might have immediately got worse for City as Odemwingie robbed Martin Demichelis and whipped in a dangerous cross, but Diouf was inches away from connecting. Odemwingie had only entered the action at half-time but it proved his last involvement and he was carried off on a stretcher after 65 minutes. City started to show some urgency and Aguero appealed for a penalty after dribbling into the box and seeing his shot take a deflection which caught Marc Wilson on the hand. Toure powered forward again only to see a strong drive deflected wide. There was then controversy involving Toure when he went down in the area three minutes from time as Pieters challenged, but Mason told him to get up and brandished a yellow card - and Stoke survived the final stages to claim their first win of the campaign. After the international break, the champions' next match is at Arsenal on Saturday 13 September, when Stoke play host to Leicester. Charlie Nicholas: Stoke superb Charlie Nicholas: Stoke superb Charlie Nicholas on Man City v Stoke Stoke showed very good decision making. They were well-linked, well-balanced and asked the wide men to get involved. For all Man City's possession, a lot of it was square passes from 35 yards out. I didn't see a lot of David Silva in the pockets of space that he likes. Nasri was quiet and Aguero was the main one who was trying. For Stoke, Bardsley was outstanding and big Crouchy was back for every corner, winning every header defensively. What a sweet day for Mark Hughes. It’s not a warning sign for Manchester City. It’s a reality check. For me, Man City should have had a penalty. I know Yaya Toure made the most of it, but Bardsley shouldn’t make the challenge - but Stoke should have had a penalty in the first half on Diouf. There was no doubt when I saw it. They got lucky, but they also had bad luck."},{"date": "30/08/2015", "arena": "St James' Park, Newcastle", "attendance": 49226, "home_team": {"name": "Newcastle United", "lineup": [{"name": "Tim Krul", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daryl Janmaat", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [79]}, {"name": "Mike Williamson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fabricio Coloccini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Massadio Haidara", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Moussa Sissoko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Colback", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rémy Cabella", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Siem de Jong", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [79]}, {"name": "Yoan Gouffran", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [67]}, {"name": "Emmanuel Riviere", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Vurnon Anita", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [79], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rolando Aarons", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [67], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ayoze Pérez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [79], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rob Elliot", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gabriel Obertan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Taylor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paul Dummett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Crystal Palace", "lineup": [{"name": "Julian Speroni", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adrian Mariappa", "yellows": [41], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Scott Dann", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Damien Delaney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Kelly", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jason Puncheon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mile Jedinak", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joel Ward", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yannick Bolasie", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [83]}, {"name": "Marouane Chamakh", "yellows": [44], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [52]}, {"name": "Dwight Gayle", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [70]}], "subs": [{"name": "Wilfried Zaha", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [70], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Brede Hangeland", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fraizer Campbell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [52], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wayne Hennessey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Glenn Murray", "yellows": [88], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [83], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonny Williams", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Barry Bannan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Wilfried Zaha upstaged fellow substitute Rolando Aarons to earn Neil Warnock a point in his first match back as Crystal Palace manager following a 3-3 draw at Newcastle United. Teenager Aarons looked to have inspired Newcastle to a first win of the season after coming off the bench to score one and create another until Zaha pounced five minutes into added time to make an immediate impact following his return to Palace on loan from Manchester United. BEST OF THE MATCH Man of the match: Despite spending under half-an-hour on the pitch, Rolando Aarons changed the game for Newcastle when he came on as he scored an excellent header and was directly involved in Mike Williamson's goal. Moment of the match: Wilfried Zaha's equaliser in the dying embers to earn Palace an unlikely point after being second-best for much of the game. Attempt of the match: Rolando Aarons' curling effort that flew over Julien Speroni and bounced off the crossbar, leading to Newcastle's third goal.Save of the match: Tim Krul's fingertip save down to his left to deny Martin Kelly's well hit effort from outside the area. Talking point: Rolando Aarons' brilliant performance off the bench as he scored one and setup another after coming on for Yoan Gouffran in the 67th minute. Goal of the match: Jason Puncheon's excellent volleyed effort from just inside the box to give Palace the lead in the first-half. Palace enjoyed a flying start to the match and were in front inside the opening minute when Dwight Gayle reacted the quickest to turn home the loose ball after Marouane Chamakh’s shot had been pushed onto the post by Tim Krul. Newcastle levelled eight minutes before half-time when Darryl Janmaat fired home his first goal for the club at the second attempt after the ball had bounced around the penalty area. But Palace regained the lead three minutes into the second half when Jason Puncheon’s driven volley took a slight deflection on its way past Krul. Alan Pardew’s side came back again on 73 minutes when Aarons, who had only been on the pitch six minutes, guided a header into the net for his first goal for Newcastle. Zaha, who could have scored before Newcastle equalised, thought he had immediately restored Palace’s advantage, but the substitute was ruled offside. With two minutes to go, Aarons cut in from the left and his curled ball into the area came back off the far post and Williamson tucked the ball home from a couple of yards out. Deep into stoppage time, Palace pinched a point when a free-kick was launched into the box and the ball dropped for Zaha to rifle a low shot through a crowd of bodies. Having failed to score in either of their first two league games and won in the Capital One Cup at Gillingham by virtue of John Egan's own goal, Alan Pardew knew victory against Palace was a must if he was to convince the club's fans that his new-look side have enough attacking threat. Newcastle boss Alan Pardew was left frustrated after his side conceded a late goal in their 3-3 draw with Crystal Palace. Newcastle boss Alan Pardew was left frustrated after his side conceded a late goal in their 3-3 draw with Crystal Palace. But whatever his game-plans was, it was blown out of the water within 30 seconds as Gayle handed Warnock the perfect start to his reign, pouncing on the rebound after goalkeeper Krul could only turn Chamakh's shot on to a post and blasting into the roof of the net. The visitors, who were also looking for their first three-point haul of the campaign, predictably retreated deep inside their own half as the shocked Magpies started the process of fighting their way back into the game. In a frustrating passage of play, the home side dominated possession, but simply could not find a cutting edge as lone striker Emmanuel Riviere was well-marshalled by the Palace rearguard, which repelled a series of insipid set-piece deliveries from Remy Cabella and Jack Colback with little difficulty. Warnock's men might have increased their lead when the recalled Puncheon, whose infamous spat with his new manager appeared to have been forgotten, fired just over after a rare break. Phil Thompson felt the visitors deserved their late equaliser. Phil Thompson felt the visitors deserved their late equaliser. However, as the half wore on, Newcastle started to make an impression, with Janmaat heading wide from a Cabella corner and Moussa Sissoko drilling inches past a post after enterprising set-up play by Siem de Jong and Riviere. But the equaliser finally arrived eight minutes before the break from an unexpected source, and courtesy of a slice of good fortune. Riviere laid off Cabella's ball into the box and it eventually fell to Janmaat, whose initial effort pinballed between defenders before the ball sat up nicely for him to stab past keeper Speroni with the help of a deflection off defender Damien Delaney. The Magpies had an opportunity to go in ahead at the break when Cabella squared a free-kick to Colback on the stroke of half-time, but the midfielder failed to celebrate his call-up to the England squad in style when he spooned his effort high over. There is little doubt Pardew will have exhorted his troops to raise the tempo on their return, but in the event, they started just as sloppily and were made to pay once again. Crystal Palace boss Neil Warnock said his players showed great character to grab a late equaliser Crystal Palace boss Neil Warnock said his players showed great character to grab a late equaliser Yannick Bolasie was allowed to pick up possession wide on the left and square for Puncheon, who controlled neatly before sending a volley across Krul and into the far corner. Newcastle were almost caught out once again with 57 minutes gone when full-back Martin Kelly exploited the space left by opposite number Janmaat as he pushed forward to surge down the left before cutting inside and testing Krul from distance with a rasping drive. But it took a good save by Speroni to deny Yoan Gouffran a 62nd-minute equaliser after De Jong had combined with Riviere to allow Colback to feed the Frenchman. Pardew introduced Aarons in a bid to add much-needed invention, but it was fellow newcomer Zaha who almost extended his side's lead 18 minutes from time when he waltzed through the home defence before seeing his effort blocked by Krul. But Aarons did make a swift impact two minutes later when he stooped to head home a second equaliser at the far post after Cabella's left-wing corner had been flicked on. Zaha was proving to be a serious nuisance and he perhaps should have scored nine minutes from time when he blazed wide of the far post after Krul had parried his first attempt. Williamson must have thought he had won it when he tapped home from close range after Aarons' audacious effort had come back off a post, but Zaha finally got it right to ensure it finished all square. Phil Thompson on Newcastle v Crystal Palace \"Neil Warnock went up to Mike Jones, the referee, after the game and was absolutely delighted. He was shaking his hand. I thought if it had finished five minutes earlier, before they’d scored, he’d have been shaking his neck! \"This was a great game with both sides going for it. Newcastle had all the possession and were trying to break Palace down, but De Jong and Riviere weren’t able to open them up. However, I look at Aarons and he’s got pace, he’s got ability, he leaps for fun and this boy is a real talent. He can excite you, but he does it in the right areas. It was a fantastic game and an absolute delight to watch.\""},{"date": "30/08/2015", "arena": "Kiyan Prince Foundation Stadium", "attendance": 17930, "home_team": {"name": "Queens Park Rangers",

first-half stoppage time saw Queens Park Rangers claim their first victory since returning to the Premier League with a 1-0 win over Sunderland at Loftus Road. It was Rangers’ first goal of the 2014/15 campaign and it also means Austin has now scored at every level in the English football league after ending the club's 315-minute Premier League drought. Austin broke the deadlock on the cusp of half-time, striking sweetly into the top right-hand corner of Vito Mannone’s goal after Leroy Fer had peeled off at the back post to knock down Joey Barton’s corner. Harry Redknapp's men were desperate for both goals and points after successive defeats by Hull, Tottenham and Burton, and had Austin to thank for a thumping first-half finish. Redknapp had started Rangers' Premier League return favouring the 3-5-2 formation, but abandoned wing-backs in favour of 4-3-3 for the visit of Gus Poyet's Black Cats. Sunderland started far the stronger but ultimately paid the price for failing to convert that dominance. Adam Johnson slid in perfect through-balls for Steven Fletcher and Patrick van Aanholt, but neither man could convert - and that after left-back Van Aanholt had prodded wide to boot. Best of the Match Man of the Match: Leroy Fer. The driving force behind many QPR attacks and could have registered a contender for Goal of the Season had his first-half effort kept inches lower. Goal of the Match: Only one to pick from but it was a memorable goal for Charlie Austin, who has now scored at every level in the English football league. Shot of the Match: Leroy Fer left the crossbar rattling for some time with a thunderous 30-yard strike. Talking Point: Following the news of Loic Remy’s departure just before kick-off, where will Harry Redknapp turn before Monday’s transfer deadline? Lee Cattermole has been highlighted a potential member of Roy Hodgson’s future England squads, but could his disciplinary record work against him? Summer recruit Fer struck a 25-yard thunderbolt against the crossbar with Mannone motionless between the sticks as QPR started to settle. Lee Cattermole was fortunate to escape a red card after grabbing and kicking at Fer, just minutes after being booked. Junior Hoilett shot straight at Mannone as the half-hour came and went, but then QPR took control. Wes Brown pulled off a perfectly-timed tackle to deny Austin who was bearing down on goal, and then Mannone had to shut down the former Burnley striker in a one-on-one. Mannone raced off his line to deny Matt Phillips as QPR scented their first goal of the new campaign in their fourth outing. And just when the home fans expected another blank half, Austin delivered, firing high into the net from a well-worked corner. Sunderland were still chasing their first league win of the campaign after two draws, but could at least draw on a morale-boosting 3-0 Capital One Cup midweek victory at Birmingham. Poyet's side were visibly deflated by conceding just ahead of half-time, and struggled to generate any tempo after the turnaround. Jack Rodwell and Fletcher had half-hearted efforts easily dealt with, before Robert Green turned a neat right-foot flick from Santiago Vergini round the post.

Dyer put the Swans ahead after only two minutes after a back-heel by Gylfi Sigurdsson into the box. Jonas Olsson slipped and allowed Dyer to latch onto the ball and he slotted home from a tight angle on the right. Best of the match Man of the match: Nathan Dyer scored a goal in either half as Swansea won again. Goal of the match: Wayne Routledge produced a superb strike to put the Swans two ahead. Save of the match: Ben Foster saved well from Wilfried Bony in the second period after Andre Wisdom had cleared from near the line. Moment of the match: Dyer’s first after just two minutes. It put the Swans on the front foot and they pushed on for the win. Talking point: Swansea made it three wins out of three to go top of the early Premier League table. Can they continue this fantastic run at Chelsea next time? Wayne Routledge then doubled the hosts’ advantage on 24 minutes with a fantastic volley from the edge of the box after Craig Dawson headed the ball into his path. West Brom improved after the break but Dyer made sure of the win with a low effort with 19 minutes remaining following a Sigurdsson flick-on as Garry Monk’s side maintained their perfect start to the campaign. But Swansea were also aided by some pitiful defending, with West Brom still seeking their first league victory under new manager Alan Irvine. Monk’s side had the perfect start inside two minutes when Dyer picked up Wilfried Bony's lay-off and drove towards the Albion area. Dyer found Sigurdsson and he took advantage of the Icelandic midfielder's clever back-heel return and Olsson's untimely slip to score his second goal in as many Premier League games. It was a high-tempo start from a Swansea side buoyant after opening wins over Manchester United and Burnley, and Bony and Jonjo Shelvey both tried their luck from distance against Albion opponents struggling to get a foothold in the contest. It was incredibly comprehensive. Honestly, from the minute that Nathan Dyer put Swansea ahead after two minutes, West Brom were never really in the game. The early goal really rocked them and it was a brilliant goal as well. Only after they went 3-0 down did West Brom actually look a little bit threatening. Sessegnon hit the bar, but it was a very, very good performance by Swansea.Dyer was excellent today. Jason Davidson was playing at left-back for West Brom and making his Premier League debut and will go home tonight wondering what he’s let himself in for if that’s going to be what it’s like every week. Dyer gave him an absolutely torrid time. Matt Le Tissier Bony headed over Shelvey's cross with West Brom temporarily reduced to 10 men with Olsson off the pitch, but Swansea doubled their lead after 24 minutes with a goal to remember. Sigurdsson centred following Chris Brunt's poor clearance and, although Dawson was first to the ball, his header lacked distance. Routledge was onto the dropping ball in an instant and with both feet off the ground he fizzed an 18-yard volley past the helpless Foster. It almost got worse for Albion when Olsson headed Routledge's cross onto his own crossbar and there was no threat from the visitors until club record £10m signing Brown Ideye, making his first Premier League start, sent in a low shot which Swansea goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski held comfortably. Routledge almost added another spectacular effort in the closing stages of the first half when Albion failed to clear a free-kick and the winger flashed a volley just over from 18 yards. More appetite West Brom showed more appetite for the fight at the start of the second period but they were fortunate to escape when Dyer found space down the right for the umpteenth time and rolled a ball into the box which Bony was just unable to connect with. Swansea were a real threat on the counter every time a West Brom attack broke down and Routledge led the charge when Brunt lost possession. Routledge got a return pass off Bony and his cross would have found the lurking Sigurdsson but for a fingertip intervention from Foster. Stephane Sessegnon's half-time arrival appeared to pep up Albion and the game was more of an even contest, albeit scrappy for some periods and tackling which could be described as dubious at best. But Ki fired straight at Foster and then there was controversy when referee Paul Tierney, in charge of his first Premier League game, adjudged that Dawson's intervention to stop Bony escaping was a deliberate back-pass to his goalkeeper. Bony took the resulting free-kick from 12 yards and his effort was blocked on the line by what appeared to be the right arm of full-back Andre Wisdom, before his follow-up shot was saved by Foster. Tierney waved away Swansea's penalty protests and Bony was out of luck again when he raced onto substitute Jefferson Montero's pass but blazed over from inside the box. But Swansea were not to be denied and it was the same Sigurdsson-Dyer combination for the first goal which again paid off after 71 minutes. Angel Rangel played the ball into Sigurdsson in midfield and he was allowed time and space to pick out Dyer who ran clear and finished emphatically past an exposed Foster. Swansea were in total control but Jordi Amat's mistake at the near post was almost punished when Sessegnon fired against the bar and then Saido Berahino's shot was deflected inches wide of Fabianski's goal. But Swansea comfortably saw out the rest of the game to make it nine points from nine."},{"date": "30/08/2015", "arena": "Upton Park", "attendance": 34907, "home_team": {"name": "West Ham United", "lineup": [{"name": "Adrián", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joey O'Brien", "yellows": [62], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Tomkins", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Winston Reid", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Cresswell", "yellows": [56], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mark Noble", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cheikhou Kouyaté", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stewart Downing", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mauro Zárate", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [57]}, {"name": "Ricardo Vaz Te", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [58]}, {"name": "Carlton Cole", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [79]}], "subs": [{"name": "Ravel Morrison", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [57], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Diafra Sakho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Guy Demel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mohamed Diamé", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [58], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jussi Jaaskelainen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Diego Poyet", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Enner Valencia", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [79], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Southampton", "lineup": [{"name": "Fraser Forster", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathaniel Clyne", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "José Fonte", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Maya Yoshida", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Bertrand", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Ward-Prowse", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [71]}, {"name": "Morgan Schneiderlin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Davis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shane Long", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [66]}, {"name": "Graziano Pellè", "yellows": [79], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dusan Tadic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Kelvin Davis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Florin Gardos", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gaston Ramirez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [66], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Wanyama", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Cork", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [71], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Emmanuel Mayuka", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jos Hooiveld", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Two goals from Morgan Schneiderlin and a late Graziano Pelle strike saw Southampton come from behind to beat West Ham 3-1 at Upton Park. Frenchman Schneiderlin, who handed in a transfer request earlier in the summer, twice profited from some sloppy Hammers defending to put the visitors on their way to three points they thoroughly deserved. MATCH FACTS Man of the match - Dusan Tadic. There were a few in Saints colours who could lay a claim for man of the match but Serb Tadic showed great quality and tormented the Hammers defence throughout. Save of the match: Fraser Forster was a virtual spectator in the second half but in the first he made a wonderful block with his boot to deflect Ricardo Vaz Te's close-range effort behind Goal of the match: Saints were inventive throughout but their short corner routine which allowed Schneiderlin to score his second was a gem Talking point: Just what did Ronald Koeman say to his side at half-time to trigger the transformation as Saints swept the home team aside? The midfielder curled in a sweet left-footer on the stroke of half-time to cancel out Mark Noble’s deflected effort then put the visitors ahead on 69 minutes when the Hammers fell asleep at a corner, allowing him to turn in James Ward-Prowse’s cross at the near post. The points were made safe seven minutes from time when Pelle got his reward for a fine centre-forward display, smashing in from close range after Adrian could only parry Nathaniel Clyne’s cross into his path. The third goal sparked a rush to the exits for the home fans, following a second home defeat in the space of a week for manager Sam Allardyce whose team were knocked out of the Capital One Cup on penalties by Sheffield United. Southampton, who won at Millwall in the cup, started brightly as Pelle and Shane Long, a £12million signing from Hull, stretched the Hammers' defence. West Ham paraded new loan signing Alex Song, the former Arsenal man joining from Barcelona, before kick-off, but took time to get into any sort of passing rhythm against the well-organised Saints. It was 20 minutes before the home side were able to create an opening. Southampton boss Ronald Koeman says his side’s late 1st half equaliser against West Ham gave his side the believe to go on and win the game 3-1. Southampton boss Ronald Koeman says his side’s late 1st half equaliser against West Ham gave his side the believe to go on and win the game 3-1. A free-kick from Stewart Downing was only half cleared, with the ball dropping back to the far post through a crowded six-yard box where Ricardo Vaz Te turned it goalwards. However, Saints goalkeeper Fraser Forster somehow made a reaction save with his leg at point-blank range to push the ball wide across the face of goal. There was, though, little the former Celtic number one could do a few moments later to prevent West Ham taking the lead in the 27th minute. Noble robbed Schneiderlin and drove towards the edge of the Saints penalty area. He let fly from 25 yards, with the ball deflecting off the boot of Maya Yoshida and into the far corner, just out of Forster's reach. Southampton looked to make a quick response, with a deep cross from the left glanced down by Pelle, which Aaron Cresswell guided off the line. To their credit, the visitors continued to stay composed despite now having to chase the match, with West Ham dropping an extra man into a packed midfield to compensate. Pelle missed his kick when Serbian midfielder Dusan Tadic found space on the left for another dangerous cross into the West Ham penalty area, which Winston Reid gratefully cleared. West Ham boss Sam Allardyce said his side were second best in their 3-1 defeat against Southampton. West Ham boss Sam Allardyce said his side were second best in their 3-1 defeat against Southampton. Schneiderlin showed the Italian how it should be done when he equalised on the stroke of half-time. A free-kick on the left touchline was floated in by Tadic and flicked on to the far post, where Schneiderlin drilled it back goalwards. Although Joey O'Brien made a brave block, Schneiderlin latched onto the rebound and curled it inside the far post. Saints went close to taking the lead at the start of the second half when a shot by Long at the edge of the penalty area was turned behind by Adrian. Tadic then had the West Ham goalkeeper scrambling down to his right with a low shot from 18 yards, and Schneiderlin crashed the ball over from 10 yards following the corner. Saints had the ball in the net again when Pelle converted a free-kick from Ward-Prowse at the far post, but was one of three players ruled offside - although the decision was a tight one. Allardyce had seen enough, and made a double change on the hour, as Ravel Morrison and Mohamed Diame replaced Mauro Zarate and Vaz Te. It was no surprise when Schneiderlin put the Saints ahead midway through the second half. A short corner caught West Ham asleep, with a cross from Ward-Prowse flicked home at the near post by the French midfielder, who wheeled away to celebrate in front of the away fans behind the goal. West Ham needed inspiration from somewhere, and £12million Ecuador forward Enner Valencia was sent on with 11 minutes left, replacing the ineffective Carlton Cole. However, Southampton made sure of the victory in the 83rd minute when Pelle smashed home after Adrian had palmed out a cross from Clyne. The boos rang out around the Boleyn Ground at full-time from those disgruntled fans who had stayed on."},{"date": "30/08/2015", "arena": "Goodison Park", "attendance": 39402, "home_team": {"name": "Everton", "lineup": [{"name": "Tim Howard", "yellows": [69], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Seamus Coleman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [67], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Jagielka", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sylvain Distin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leighton Baines", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James McCarthy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gareth Barry", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin Mirallas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Naismith", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aiden McGeady", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [70]}, {"name": "Romelu Lukaku", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [89]}], "subs": [{"name": "Joel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Darron Gibson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Samuel Eto'o", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [70], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Muhamed Besic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [89], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leon Osman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Stones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Antolin Alcaraz", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Chelsea", "lineup": [{"name": "Thibaut Courtois", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Branislav Ivanovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gary Cahill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Terry", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "César Azpilicueta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ramires", "yellows": [64], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nemanja Matic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willian", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [75]}, {"name": "Cesc Fàbregas", "yellows": [81], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [89]}, {"name": "Eden Hazard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [83]}, {"name": "Diego Costa", "yellows": [56], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Petr Cech", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Filipe Luis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [83], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kurt Zouma", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Didier Drogba", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [89], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Mikel Obi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [75], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "André Schürrle", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mohamed Salah", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Diego Costa: Chelsea striker scored twice against Everton Chelsea hit Everton for six in a goal-filled Premier League extravaganza at Goodison Park which finally ended 6-3. Jose Mourinho’s side were two goals to the good inside the opening three minutes as Diego Costa found the net with just 35 seconds on the clock before Branislav Ivanovic doubled their lead against the shell-shocked hosts. Best of the match Man of the match: Diego Costa. The Chelsea striker scored with just 35 seconds on the clock and then added the final goal in the last minute to make it four in three games. Goal of the match: He may have ended up on the losing side, but Kevin Mirallas’ header from Seamus Coleman’s cross was outstanding. Moment(s) of the match: The astonishing 10-minute spell in the second half which saw five goals as the two teams went toe-to-toe in style. Blunder of the match: Muhamed Besic’s first touch only succeeded in gifting the ball to Chelsea and allowing Diego Costa to score their sixth. Controversy of the match: It will probably get overlooked after the nine-goal thriller, but Tim Howard got away with a clear handball outside the box in only the eighth minute. Save of the match: Thibaut Courtois' finger-tip save to deny Kevin Mirallas when Chelsea were 5-3 up with 10 minutes to go. Kevin Mirallas’ fine header brought Everton back into the game just before the interval and they started the second half strongly before Eden Hazard’s driving run saw Seamus Coleman deflect the ball beyond Tim Howard. The two teams then traded goals like heavyweight boxers going toe-to-toe, with Steven Naismith, Nemanja Matic, former Chelsea striker Samuel Eto’o and Ramires all finding the net in an astonishing eight-minute spell. With Everton pushing forward in a desperate attempt to close the gap again, substitute Muhamed Besic’s dismal first touch allowed Costa to claim his second of the game and cap an all-time classic of the Premier League era. Bizarrely it could have been even worse for Everton, as goalkeeper Howard could easily have been sent off for handling outside his area after just eight minutes. Up until Naismith's strike, Chelsea appeared to have everything under control, with Costa showing the new attacking edge which was lacking from Mourinho's side last season. It took just seconds to dismiss fears over a suggested hamstring injury as he scored before Everton had even touched the ball from kick-off. There has been plenty of debate about some of the sums being spent by English clubs in the current window, but Costa is already looking value for money after scoring with his third shot on target this season. The Brazilian-born Spain international was a constant menace, lurking with intent on the shoulder of the last defender and regularly capitalising on Everton's inability to play an offside trap which cost them two goals inside 170 seconds. But for all the 25-year-old's threat, he still needs someone to provide the ammunition and that person is currently Cesc Fabregas, who more often than not found his compatriot with unerring accuracy. Jose Mourinho praised the offensive performance of his Chelsea team following their 6-3 victory over Everton at Goodison Park, but conceded he was unhappy Jose Mourinho praised the offensive performance of his Chelsea team following their 6-3 victory over Everton at Goodison Park, but conceded he was unhappy The first goal game from exactly that source, as the former Arsenal and Barcelona midfielder threaded through a pass, catching the defence on their heels, for Costa to stride on to and dispatch past Howard. In doing so he became only the second Chelsea player to score in his first three Premier League appearances for the club after Adrian Mutu. More madcap defending saw last man Leighton Baines push out a fraction too slowly to make it obvious Ivanovic was offside - which he fractionally was - and the Serbian finished with the poise of a striker. John Terry said that Diego Costa has everything and praised his impact on the Chelsea squad after he bagged a brace for the Blue’s in their thrilling 6-3 w John Terry said that Diego Costa has everything and praised his impact on the Chelsea squad after he bagged a brace for the Blue’s in their thrilling 6-3 w Such was the disbelief around Goodison even the electronic scoreboard took a couple of minutes to register the second goal, and Howard looked equally confused when he came clearly two yards outside his area to catch a through-ball before falling back inside the box. A red card then would have ended Everton's afternoon, but Sylvain Distin's goal disallowed for offside after he followed in Romelu Lukaku's header against the crossbar suggested there was still fight in Roberto Martinez's side. That materialised through Mirallas' glancing header from Coleman's cross, which was the first time Everton had got around the back six Chelsea had employed since going ahead so early. Costa, put through again by Fabregras, was denied only by the outstretched leg of Howard before Hazard's cross from the byline was turned in by Coleman. But the game was far from over as a brilliant run by Lukaku took three defenders away with him to allow Aiden McGeady to pick out Naismith in space and make it 3-2. Matic's strike then deflected in off Jagielka before Eto'o, who signed a two-year deal in the week, headed in Baines' free-kick within six minutes of coming off the bench. Ramires' one-two with Matic provided Chelsea's crucial fifth and, after Mirallas volleyed against the post, Costa added his second in the 90th minute when substitute Besic, making his debut, fluffed a backheel in the centre-circle which presented the Spain international with a run on goal after great work from John Obi Mikel.

Jamie Redknapp People talk about the Spanish league being more technical, but when you see a game like that – blood, thunder, mistakes, great goals, individual performances – it had absolutely everything as a spectacle. You have had pure value for money whether you were at Goodison Park or watching that at home. A fantastic football match. Diego Costa is a game changer and people like that are what you pay the big money for. They lost David Luiz and brought in him and Fabregas for only £10million difference – and what piece of business that is."},{"date": "25/08/2015", "arena": "Etihad Stadium", "attendance": 45471, "home_team": {"name": "Manchester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Joe Hart", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pablo Zabaleta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [83], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Vincent Kompany", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martín Demichelis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gael Clichy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Samir Nasri", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yaya Touré", "yellows": [29], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fernando", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Silva", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [65]}, {"name": "Stevan Jovetic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [80]}, {"name": "Edin Dzeko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [68]}], "subs": [{"name": "Bacary Sagna", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Milner", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aleksandar Kolarov", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willy Caballero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jesus Navas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [65], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sergio Agüero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [68], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fernandinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [80], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Liverpool", "lineup": [{"name": "Simon Mignolet", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Glen Johnson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Skrtel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dejan Lovren", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alberto Moreno", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordan Henderson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Gerrard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Allen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [75]}, {"name": "Raheem Sterling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [79]}, {"name": "Daniel Sturridge", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Philippe Coutinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [60]}], "subs": [{"name": "Brad Jones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kolo Touré", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rickie Lambert", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [79], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mamadou Sakho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Javi Manquillo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Emre Can", "yellows": [76], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [75], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lazar Markovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [60], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Stevan Jovetic scored either side of half-time to help Manchester City earn a 3-1 Premier League home win over Liverpool.

Best of the Match Man of the Match: Stevan Jovetic. Looks rejuvenated after difficult first season. Goal of the Match: Stevan Jovetic. Started the move for City's second, and finished it off with aplomb. Save of the Match: Joe Hart. Unfortunate the rebound went in, but save from Lambert header was top drawer. Talking Points: Did City send a message tonight? Do Liverpool need to strengthen still? Will Balotelli make a difference? Then after the interval, Jovetic added his and City's second, starting and finishing the move from close range. Sergio Aguero then added a third a matter of seconds after coming off the bench, latching onto a pinpoint pass from fellow substitute Jesus Navas to make sure of the three points. Pablo Zabaleta put through his own goal late on, but it was a mere consolation for the visitors. It was all about City making a statement at the Etihad, and the manner of their emphatic victory certainly sent their title rivals a message. The first 30 minutes was very cagey, as both teams played some good football without finding a killer pass. Daniel Sturridge did come close to breaking the deadlock but after beating Vincent Kompany, the England forward fired straight at Joe Hart. The deadlock was broken four minutes before the break. Samir Nasri clipped the ball into the box, it was half-cleared, but as Moreno dallied on the loose ball, Jovetic nipped in, stole the ball off Moreno's toe and smashed City into a half-time lead. Pellegrini delighted with display Pellegrini delighted with display After the break, City got into their stride quickly, but Liverpool did have the ball in the net, only for Sturridge to be ruled offside. Edin Dzeko should have done better after being put through, and was soon replaced by Aguero, who made the ultimate impact off the bench. With his first touch, the Argentina striker ran onto Navas’ sublime pass, which was perfectly weighted for Aguero to take in his stride and slot the ball past a stranded Mignolet. Rodgers takes the positives Rodgers takes the positives Liverpool did get themselves back into it. Sturridge’s cross was met by the head of substitute Rickie Lambert, whose effort was brilliantly saved by Hart, but Pablo Zabaleta inadvertently put the ball into his own net when trying to clear. Lambert was again in the clear after a fortunate ricochet, but he elected to pass when he maybe should have been more selfish. Nasri and Jovetic reaction Nasri and Jovetic reaction Liverpool finished the match with 10 men as Glen Johnson had to go off with an injury, with Brendan Rodgers having already used all his subs. While not at their blistering best, City were clinical when it really mattered, and in Jovetic, they may have another player who can make a real difference in the title race.

Stoke City denied 10-man Hull City a second successive 1-0 win after Ryan Shawcross scrambled home an equaliser to secure a 1-1 draw at the KC Stadium. Hull overcame James Chester’s early red card to open the scoring on 42 minutes through Nikica Jelavic, but Stoke struck with seven minutes to go when Shawcross’ scruffy finished just sneaked over the line. Chester, who scored last week’s winner at Queens Park Rangers and also conceded a penalty, was dismissed on 14 minutes for bringing down Glenn Whelan after Jake Livermore’s poor pass had put the defender in trouble. The home side reorganised and took the lead three minutes before half-time when Asmir Begovic pushed out Tom Huddlestone’s low shot and Jelavic slid in to squeeze the ball home from a narrow angle. Best of the Match: Man of the Match: It was old-fashioned following in from Nikica Jelavic to give Hull the lead. The striker gets the nod for leading the attack on his own. Save of the Match: Allan McGregor had to be at his best to turn a powerful effort from Charlie Adam over the bar. Goal of the Match: Neither of the two goals in this match will be among the best this season but Jelavic gets the credit for using his attacking instinct. Talking Point: Is there more to come from Stoke after a couple of disappointing displays to open the season? Stoke toiled in search of an equaliser, with Charlie Adam testing Allan McGregor moments after coming on as a substitute, before Mark Hughes’ side levelled with seven minutes to go in fortunate fashion. Phil Bardsley’s volley came back off the post, McGregor pushed the ball away and Shawcross’ close-range effort just rolled over the line via the Hull keeper and the upright, although referee Jon Moss took his time before awarding the goal. Hull were left to fume with the goal coming from a Stoke throw-in which should have gone the home side's way. Steve Bruce’s side were eager to assert themselves in the opening minutes, looking to get on the front foot and attempting to target Bardsley at right-back. Andrew Robertson was the chosen outlet and he began to find his range with a couple of teasing crosses from the left. Yet despite Hull's positive start, exemplified by the busy Stephen Quinn, Stoke were threatening on the break. Bruce hails magnificent Hull Bruce hails magnificent Hull Their first warning came after only three minutes when Peter Odemwingie played in Mame Diouf, who shook off Chester to leave himself clean through but was judged to have fouled the defender in the process. Chester was not so lucky next time, when Livermore's underhit back pass invited Whelan to charge at goal. All the momentum lay with the Irishman, who was left in a heap by an outstretched leg that had denied a clear scoring chance. The tactical reshuffle was relatively simple, Ahmed Elmohamady and Robertson swapping wing-back to full-back and Tom Ince dropping deeper into midfield and it was a system Stoke struggled to pick holes in despite their advantage. There were half-chances - an Odemwingie dribble into the area, Erik Pieters' wayward drive - but the hosts were holding up well. Stoke display frustrates Hughes Stoke display frustrates Hughes Hughes responded by sending on summer signing Bojan Krkic four minutes before half-time, with Whelan sacrificed, but he was unimpressive in Hull's opener just seconds later. Lacking the bite that Whelan would have offered, he allowed Huddlestone to breeze past him before unleashing a low shot that Begovic could only palm back out. Jelavic anticipated well, beat Marc Wilson to the ball and hooked home from a tight angle. It was the least Hull's battling response deserved and it was the hosts who ended the half pressing for a second as Stoke lost all semblance of calm. Hughes' half-time words seemed to have some effect, with his side much improved after the break. Davies bemoans decision Davies bemoans decision McGregor was called on twice in as many minutes, saving low from Shawcross following a free-kick routine then diving in front of Diouf to smother a cross. The respective managers quickly re-drew the battle lines, Hughes sending Peter Crouch on as a second striker and Bruce replacing Ince with another defender in Liam Rosenior. Stoke had their best chance yet when Bojan's deft pass played in Crouch after 64 minutes but a clumsy touch allowed McShane to make a covering challenge. The ball looped invitingly for Diouf but his cushioned header landed a yard wide. Stoke's final substitute, Adam, was into the game immediately, firing a 25-yarder that McGregor flicked over the crossbar. Shawcross: A good point Shawcross: A good point The game was gradually building towards Stoke's response but Hull did not seem liable to crack. It took a wrongly-awarded throw-in and an unusual bounce of the ball to breach them, Bardsley hitting Bojan's cross into the ground and watching it rear up and bounce off the frame of the goal. McGregor, briefly disorientated, allowed it to come back off him instead of gathering it and Shawcross did just enough - his effort confirmed by goal-line technology. There would no winner but Hull, ever game for the fight, ended the game bravely seeking one."},{"date": "24/08/2015", "arena": "White Hart Lane", "attendance": 36109, "home_team": {"name": "Tottenham Hotspur", "lineup": [{"name": "Hugo Lloris", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eric Dier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Younes Kaboul", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jan Vertonghen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Rose", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Etienne Capoue", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nabil Bentaleb", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [59]}, {"name": "Erik Lamela", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Eriksen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nacer Chadli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [69]}, {"name": "Emmanuel Adebayor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [80]}], "subs": [{"name": "Aaron Lennon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Roberto Soldado", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [80], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lewis Holtby", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Kane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [69], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mousa Dembélé", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [59], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Brad Friedel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Davies", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Queens Park Rangers", "lineup": [{"name": "Robert Green", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Caulker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rio Ferdinand", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Richard Dunne", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Mauricio Isla", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joey Barton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordon Mutch", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leroy Fer", "yellows": [64], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [68]}, {"name": "Armand Traore", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matt Phillips", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [74]}, {"name": "Loïc Remy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Danny Simpson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shaun Wright-Phillips", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nedum Onuoha", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alejandro Faurlin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [68], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Brian Murphy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Junior Hoilett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bobby Zamora", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [74], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Nacer Chadli: Celebrates after giving Spurs the lead against QPR Tottenham's winning start to the season continued as they brushed QPR aside with a convincing 4-0 victory at White Hart Lane.

Harry Redknapp was enduring a miserable return to White Hart Lane and things were made worse for him on 37 minutes as Chadli netted his second of the afternoon with a fine header following Lamela’s surging run and cross. A change in formation brought a second-half improvement from the visitors, but Adebayor grabbed the goal his performance deserved as he slotted beyond Green with a cool finish after being found by Danny Rose to make it four. Redknapp - the last man to take Spurs into the Champions League - answered a number of calls from the home fans to give them a wave of acknowledgement, but he will not remember this return with any fondness. The 67-year-old has been keen to play three central defenders this season and recruited accordingly by bringing in Rio Ferdinand and former Tottenham man Steven Caulker to play alongside Richard Dunne. But they could not deal with a rampant Spurs front trio, with the rejuvenated Lamela again pulling the strings as Redknapp's first game back at White Hart Lane since his sacking in 2012 - and Mauricio Pochettino's maiden competitive home game as manager - proved to be the most one-sided match of the new Premier League season so far. Matt Phillips, operating in attack for the visitors in the absence of the injured Charlie Austin, wasted a gilt-edged opportunity to level when he clipped over when through on Hugo Lloris' goal but, other than a couple of other half-chances, Rangers were simply outclassed. Lamela's first-minute chance set the tone for the afternoon as QPR wing-back Armand Traore gifted possession to Adebayor, with his ball then finding the Argentina international whose effort deflected behind for a corner. The home side were deservingly ahead shortly afterwards as Chadli calmly took down Adebayor's cross to the back post and slotted past Green. QPR had been complicit in their own downfall, with Christian Eriksen robbing Loic Remy of the ball in midfield to set the Tottenham move in motion. Mauricio Pochettino was pleased with his side's 4-0 win over QPR Mauricio Pochettino was pleased with his side's 4-0 win over QPR Redknapp would have been alarmed by the way his side had started defensively, with a QPR free-kick being countered by a powerful Jan Vertonghen run and Adebayor shooting straight at Green from the Belgian's pass. Phillips was then guilty of missing an easy chance to level after latching on to Joey Barton's long goal-kick. The Scotland international forward did well to initially take the ball down and bypass Younes Kaboul but he then miscued a chip and sent his effort well over the crossbar. Harry Redknapp says QPR failed to do the basics at White Hart Lane Harry Redknapp says QPR failed to do the basics at White Hart Lane The miss was almost compounded as Spurs broke and Ferdinand went through the back of Lamela to concede a free-kick in dangerous territory, with Eriksen's set-piece bouncing back into play off the crossbar. The second goal came just as QPR looked to be slowly clawing their way back into the contest. Dier evaded QPR new boy Leroy Fer and stooped to head Lamela's 29th-minute corner past Green. Pochettino's side needed just seven more minutes to end the game as a contest, easing through the ramshackle QPR defence at will as Chadli headed home his second of the afternoon following a smart cross from the impressive Lamela. Goalscorers Nacer Chadli and Eric Dier give their reaction to the win Goalscorers Nacer Chadli and Eric Dier give their reaction to the win Redknapp switched to a back four at half-time as he introduced Nedum Onuoha in place of Dunne, who had struggled more than his defensive partners in the first half. Still the goals continued to come for the hosts, Adebayor with the fourth, finishing with aplomb after Chadli and Rose combined well down the left. Chadli received a standing ovation as he was replaced by Harry Kane with a little over 20 minutes remaining, and Fer's inauspicious debut also came to an end as Alejandro Faurlin took his place. Bobby Zamora was also thrown on by Redknapp in the hunt for a consolation, but it was a deflected Caulker shot after 78 minutes that finally saw Hugo Lloris have to make a save of note. The ball did find its way past Lloris later in the half as it looped in off the head of Rose, with Anthony Taylor rightly ruling out the goal following a clear push. Redknapp had waved to the Spurs fans when they sang for him to do so in the first half but, when he once again answered their calls late on, QPR's travelling contingent jeered their manager for the show of affection. Former Tottenham striker Zamora summed up QPR's afternoon as he snatched at a close-range effort and ballooned the ball into the stand - much to the joy of the jubilant home crowd."},{"date":

Juan Mata goal as Manchester United drew 1-1 at Sunderland in the Premier League on Sunday. Antonio Valencia made United's 17th-minute opener at the Stadium of Light, getting space away from Patrick van Aanholt on the right edge of the box before firing in a low cross that Mata was able to tap home from four yards out. Watch the Super Sunday panel's analysis of Manchester United's penalty appeals Watch the Super Sunday panel's analysis of Manchester United's penalty appeals But on the half-hour mark, Sebastian Larsson's corner was met with a firm downward header by £10million summer-signing Rodwell for the Sunderland equaliser, with Valencia at fault due to his lacklustre marking. After the break, Ashley Young was booked for diving seconds after a Robin van Persie penalty appeal had been waved away by referee Martin Atkinson, and Sunderland goalkeeper Vito Mannone later ventured outside his area to tackle Young after he was played into space by Danny Welbeck. The Black Cats are 11th in the early table after starting the season with two draws, whlile United - who again played with three centre-backs and Young and Valencia as wing-backs - are 13th after Louis van Gaal collected his first point as manager. Best of the Match Man of the Match: Lee Cattermole. The Sunderland captain unsettled United's midfield and kept prompting Sunderland to drive forward when they regained possession. Moment of the Match: Santiago Vergini's 62nd-minute tackle on Robin van Persie inside the area could have been seen as a penalty by a different referee. Goal of the Match: Antonio Valencia did very well to create Juan Mata's close-range opener, even if his marking for Sunderland's equaliser left a lot to be desired. Talking Point: Will Louis van Gaal persist with three centre-backs and wing-backs? Smalling's injury and the defensive inadequacies of Valencia and Young meant the system again failed to convince. Sunderland head coach Gus Poyet made two changes to the team which started the 2-2 draw at West Brom, as Santiago Vergini and Will Buckley replaced Valentin Roberge and Adam Johnson. Van Persie was one of three changes to the United side which lost 2-1 at home to Swansea last weekend, with he, Valencia and Tom Cleverley replacing Javier Hernandez, Jesse Lingard and Ander Herrera. United's fragile back three of Phil Jones, Chris Smalling and Tyler Blackett was further reduced in terms of experience when Smalling limped off before the break to be replaced by Michael Keane. But it was not only at the back that the visitors struggled, with Sunderland clearly carrying the momentum of last season's two victories over United, and skipper Wayne Rooney and strike-partner Van Persie saw little of the ball where it mattered most. Nevertheless, it was United who took the lead, although they did so at a time when the breakthrough looked more likely to come at the other end. Van Gaal coy on Di Maria Van Gaal coy on Di Maria Young had already put his defence under pressure with an aimless crossfield pass and Lee Cattermole unleashed two long-range efforts when winger Buckley, making his full debut for the Black Cats, cut inside Blackett and cross for Connor Wickham, who wastefully scuffed his shot straight at keeper David de Gea. Sunderland were made to pay within seconds as Valencia managed to ease past full-back van Aanholt and cross low to the far post, where Mata ran off the back of Larsson to score from close range. The goal visibly settled United and they enjoyed a sustained period of possession as they threatened to take control. Gus Poyet says he still hopes to sign Fabio Borini from Liverpool Gus Poyet says he still hopes to sign Fabio Borini from Liverpool However, they allowed their hosts back into the game on the half-hour when, after Buckley's direct play had earned his side a corner, Larsson delivered the resulting set-piece to the near post and Rodwell headed firmly home with Valencia having done little to impede his progress. United's response was lukewarm, and there was little doubt that Poyet would have been the happier of the two managers as their respective teams left the pitch at the break. Indeed, the home side might have taken the lead six minutes after the restart when Wickham was given time to work himself into a shooting position inside the box and Blackett somehow blocked his effort with De Gea beaten. Man-of-the-match Cattermole and goalscorer Rodwell's post-match reaction Man-of-the-match Cattermole and goalscorer Rodwell's post-match reaction But Van Gaal's men gradually assumed control as they dominated possession, although with Sunderland defending deep, space was at a premium even with Rooney dropping ever deeper. They almost found a way through with 62 minutes gone when Van Persie surged into the box only to be halted by Vergini's last-ditch challenge, and Young was booked for simulation after going over Wes Brown's leg as the pair close don the rebound. Van Persie departed seconds later as he and Darren Fletcher were replaced by Welbeck and Adnan Januzaj, but Larsson failed to make the most of Wickham's fine 68th-minute through-ball as United lived dangerously once again. Larsson passed up a good opportunity when he curled a free-kick well wide with 15 minutes remaining with Sunderland hunting all three points. To that end, Poyet attempted to pile the pressure on the visitors' rearguard with the introduction of battering-ram frontman Jozy Altidore, although defensive confusion inside the Sunderland penalty area very nearly cost them on more than one occasion in a frenetic finish.

The visitors carved out several good chances but failed to find a goal during the lunchtime encounter at Villa Park, and then had centre-back Williamson dismissed for fouls on Darren Bent and Fabian Delph in the closing stages. In the first half, Magpies new-boys Emmanuel Riviere and Remy Cabella should both have scored from close range for the visitors, while former Toon winger Charles N'Zogbia went close with a free-kick for the hosts. Best of the Match Man of the match: Alan Hutton (Aston Villa). The full-back made some vital tackles and was always a threat going forward. Moment of the match: Newcastle substitute Siem De Jong had the game’s best chance in the closing stages, but his stinging drive brought a superb save from Villa keeper Brad Guzan. Attempt of the match: Newcastle defender Daryl Janmaat met a centre from Mike Williamson but his header was tipped over by Villa keeper Brad Guzan. Save of the match: Villa’s Brad Guzan got his angles exactly right to deny Siem de Jong late on, saving his fierce shot at the second attempt. Talking point: There appeared to be such a lack of urgency from both sides which is surprising just two weeks into the season. The match was played at a pace more akin to a pre-season friendly it had 0-0 written all over it from the early stages. After the interval, Daryl Janmaat forced a fine save out of Brad Guzan as Newcastle continued to push forwards. Carlos Sanchez and Siem de Jong got their first taste of competitive English football during the second half with appearances from the bench, and another substitute - Ayoze Perez - could have grabbed the headlines but fired over when well placed. De Jong also missed a fine chance before Mike Dean gave Williamson his marching orders in stoppage time as the match ended goalless in front of a crowd of 30, 267. Newcastle boss Alan Pardew will take some comfort from the performance and outcome - which halted the Tyneside outfit's five-game away losing streak from the end of last season - but there was little to cheer Villa manager Paul Lambert, with his side rarely threatening. Watched from the stands by England boss Roy Hodgson, it was Villa who actually appeared likelier to score early on, with Gabriel Agbonlahor having a shot blocked by Williamson in the fifth minute. Williamson nodded tamely wide at the other end, then diverted a Villa cross to the Newcastle back post, where N'Zogbia could only head it onto the roof of the net. Yoan Gouffran suffered an embarrassing moment soon after as he completely mis-kicked while trying to convert a flicked-on Magpies corner. Coloccini: Challenges Delph for the ball Former Newcastle man N'Zogbia looked more potent in the 17th minute as he curled a free-kick narrowly wide. The visitors then saw a free-kick of their own sent high over the bar by Jack Colback, before Cabella passed up a good opportunity in the 25th minute, shooting wide while off-balance after the ball deflected his way in the Villa box from a cross. It proved to be the clearest-cut chance of a half which saw the Villa fans raising their voices to chant Roy Keane's name every now and again, particularly when the assistant manager made his feelings about the on-field proceedings known in animated fashion. Janmaat: Exchange of views with Roy Keane Andreas Weimann showed some intent for the hosts, seeing a shot blocked and a cross into the danger zone go unconverted, and team-mate Fabian Delph then lofted an effort over from the edge of the D. For Newcastle, Riviere failed to make the most of a through-ball by Cabella as his weak shot was gathered by Guzan. The deadlock was closer to being broken shortly after the interval when Williamson nodded back across the area to the diving Janmaat, whose header was parried over by Guzan. Lambert and Pardew: On the touchline Janmaat then arrowed a strike just the wrong side of the top corner with Guzan at full stretch, and the away team's pressure continued as a delivery dropped nicely for Williamson in front of goal, only for the defender to become the latest player to completely fluff an attempted finish. Both sides subsequently brought summer signings on for their debuts, Sanchez replacing N'Zogbia and De Jong being introduced for Vurnon Anita, before Philippe Senderos headed a free-kick harmlessly off-target for the hosts. Lambert then threw on Bent for Kieran Richardson. The former Sunderland striker was making his first competitive Villa appearance since returning from a season-long loan spell with Fulham, and he was soon trying to make his mark, directing a header onto the top of the net. N'Zogbia: Up against Paul Dummett Another Newcastle substitute, Perez, scuffed over in the 84th minute and De Jong then almost snatched three points in the 88th when Villa failed to deal with a bouncing ball. It came to the Holland international, who lashed a shot at goal, but Guzan was alert to parry before diving on the ball. The visitors were reduced to 10 men in stoppage time when Williamson picked up his second booking in the space of just a few minutes following a challenge on Delph.

"report": "In-form Diego Costa scored on his competitive Stamford Bridge debut as Chelsea beat Leicester 2-0 in the Premier League. The 25-year-old Spain striker, who cost the Blues £32million when they signed him from Atletico Madrid earlier this summer, grabbed the opening goal of the game from six yards out in the 63rd minute on Saturday after good work down the right by Oscar and Branislav Ivanovic. Best of the Match Man of the match: Eden Hazard was central to most of the Blues' attacks and made sure of the result with a great strike late on Moment of the match: David Nugent's miss early on in the second-half when the scores were still level after going clean through on goal. Attempt of the match: Willian's late effort brought the best out of Kasper Schmeichel after a great run down the middle of the pitch. Save of the match: Schmeichel's excellent stop from Branislav Ivanovic's fierce effort from inside the box early in the second-half. Goal of the match: Hazard's fine strike late on was a great example of the Belgian's competency in front of goal, as he skinned his man to deliver a fine strike past Schmeichel. Talking Point: Club legend Didier Drogba’s standing ovation in an emotional return to Stamford Bridge for the first time as a Chelsea player since leaving the club in 2012. That took Costa's goal tally in a Chelsea shirt to six, having netted against Olimpija Ljubljana, Fenerbahce and Real Sociedad (two) in pre-season and in the 3-1 win at Burnley last Monday night. Eden Hazard doubled the home side's advantage on 77 minutes when he cut into the box off the left wing after a Cesc Fabregas pass and fired in a shot that was deflected past Kasper Schmeichel by Wes Morgan's heel. Leicester, back in the top flight for the first time since 2003/2004, had proved hard to break down and could have taken the lead when David Nugent was put clean through, but Belgium goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois - again picked ahead of Petr Cech - made a smart save. Both sides were positive during the opening stages, and Leicester, playing in red and having made a couple of changes from their opening-day 2-2 draw with Everton, were not looking in awe of a side expected to contest the Premier League title once again. A deflected shot from Oscar looped up over Schmeichel and onto the roof of the net before World Cup winner Andre Schurrle drove his 20-yard effort high into the Shed End. Leicester, last season's Championship winners, offered some threat on the break themselves. On 17 minutes, a dangerous cross from Ritchie De Laet on the overlap down the right had to be headed behind by Ivanovic. Algerian Riyad Mahrez forced a decent save from Courtois with a low strike after weaving into space at the edge of the Chelsea penalty area. Chelsea looked to step up a gear as Costa pulled the trigger from 18 yards, but Foxes captain Morgan flung himself in the way to deflect the ball over. Blues boss Jose Mourinho was out of his technical area claiming a penalty moments later when Costa went down under a strong challenge from the defender, but referee Lee Mason was unmoved, which on replays looked the correct call. Mourinho hails Chelsea's change of attitude Mourinho hails Chelsea's change of attitude Oscar was unfortunate not to give Chelsea the lead at the start of the second half when his curling 20-yard effort came back off the inside of the far post. Ivanovic's header was palmed away by Schmeichel from the follow-up attack. Schurrle was then flattened by a sliding challenge from Dean Hammond on the far touchline - which had the Chelsea bench remonstrating with the fourth official, but referee Mason produced only a yellow card. Leicester closed down the free-kick and broke quickly, with the ball eventually worked out to Nugent on the left side of the Chelsea penalty area. His low shot was deflcted goalwards and kicked away by Courtois. As the match opened up, Ivanovic was denied by another fine save from the Leicester keeper, this time an angled drive touched over. Le Tissier impressed by Leicester Le Tissier impressed by Leicester The visitors could have taken the lead on 55 minutes when Nugent beat the offside trap to run clear on goal, but Courtois made a smart save to push the ball wide. Almost straight away and Chelsea were in at the other end, as Fabrgeas ghosted into the right side of the Leicester penalty area, where his angled chip was palmed behind by Schmeichel. The breakthrough finally came on 63 minutes. Oscar played Ivanovic into the right side of the area, and his cutback was chested down by Costa, before he drilled the ball past Schmeichel from six yards. Chelsea immediately made a change as Schurrle was replaced by Ramires. Pearson felt Foxes deserved a point Pearson felt Foxes deserved a point On 68 minutes, Leicester sent on Marc Albrighton to make his debut after joining from Aston Villa, with Mahrez coming off. Hammond was then also substituted, hobbling into the away dugout as Gary Taylor-Fletcher came on. Chelsea looked to have wrapped things up with 13 minutes left when Hazard collected the ball on the left, cut inside before drilling a low shot past Schmeichel into the corner. Stamford Bridge was soon rocking again when Didier Drogba was sent on for a cameo, the veteran striker having rejoined the club in the summer - with owner Roman Abramovich leading the applause. With two minutes left, Schmeichel tipped a 25-yard drive from substitute Willian over the crossbar. Fabregas: Blues must keep improving Fabregas: Blues must keep improving Chelsea, who stay top on goal difference from Swansea after two games played, travel to Everton next Saturday, while Leicester - who are 14th in the embryonic table - host Shrewsbury in the Capital One Cup second round on Tuesday and then Arsenal at the King Power Stadium in the league the following Sunday. Matt Le Tissier on Chelsea v Leicester I was really impressed with Leicester, in the first half especially. They set up really well, they countered well and quick and when they went forward, they threw numbers at Chelsea. I tipped them to struggle and perhaps get relegated, but I’ve watched them in the first two games and I’d be very surprised if that team went down. I don’t know what Jose Mourinho said to Chelsea at half-time, but they came out firing on all cylinders, especially Ivanovic who was their best attacking force. He was up and down that touchline and in the box at every possible opportunity."},{"date": "23/08/2015", "arena": "Selhurst Park", "attendance": 24242, "home_team": {"name": "Crystal Palace", "lineup": [{"name": "Julian Speroni", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Kelly", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Brede Hangeland", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Damien Delaney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joel Ward", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Barry Bannan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [71]}, {"name": "Mile Jedinak", "yellows": [89], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stuart O'Keefe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [83]}, {"name": "Yannick Bolasie", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marouane Chamakh", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fraizer Campbell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [70]}], "subs": [{"name": "Adrian Mariappa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paddy McCarthy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adlene Guedioura", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wayne Hennessey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dwight Gayle", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [70], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Glenn Murray", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [83], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonny Williams", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [71], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "West Ham United", "lineup": [{"name": "Adrián", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joey O'Brien", "yellows": [75], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Tomkins", "yellows": [45], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Winston Reid", "yellows": [40], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Cresswell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cheikhou Kouyaté", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mark Noble", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stewart Downing", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Mauro Zárate", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [83]}, {"name": "Ricardo Vaz Te", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Carlton Cole", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [68]}], "subs": [{"name": "Ravel Morrison", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Diafra Sakho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [68], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Guy Demel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mohamed Diamé", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jussi Jaaskelainen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Diego Poyet", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [83], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Enner Valencia", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Carlton Cole (R): Celebrates with fellow goalscorer Stewart Downing Managerless Crystal Palace are still seeking their first win of the Premier League season after losing 3-1 at home to West Ham United. Thirty-four minutes into the game, summer signing Mauro Zarate fired the Hammers into the lead with a superbly struck volley that left Palace keeper Julian Speroni with no chance. Best of the match Man of the match: Stewart Downing was a constant threat down the right-hand side and his delivery was faultless throughout. His performance was capped off by a superbly accurate 20 yard drive to put West Ham 2-0 up. Honourable mentions to Cheickou Kouyate and Mauro Zarate. Moment of the match: Carlton Cole’s goal to make it 3-1 silenced a previously boisterous Selhurst Park, who were anticipating an equaliser. Cole’s goal put the game beyond doubt. Goal of the match: Mauro Zarate’s volley came straight out of the top drawer, with a sweetly-struck drive leaving Julian Speroni with no chance. Miss of the match: James Tomkins’ header crashed off the bar, despite the centre-back standing just a couple of yards away from goal. It almost cost them, but the Hammers held on. Talking point: The result shows just how quickly Palace’s co-chairman Steve Parish needs to act in their quest to appoint a new manager. Selhurst Park was very flat after West Ham’s third and their fans will need a boost in the coming days, but can they secure the right man? Less than five minutes later, winger Stewart Downing cut in from the right wing and curled a sumptuous effort from 25 yards to double the Irons' lead. Just two minutes after the break, James Tomkins met Downing's deep corner but the centre-back smashed his header against the bar from a couple of yards out Immediately after Tomkins' glorious chance, Palace pulled a goal back after striker Marouane Chamakh picked up the ball from 20 yards and drilled an effort into the bottom-right corner past a sprawling Adrian. Palace's tails were up and with an equaliser looking inevitable, West Ham went to the other end and put the game beyond doubt after Carlton Cole fired a low drive past a statuesque Speroni to make it 3-1. Palace's second straight defeat plunged the south London club into further distress, with the board still hunting a replacement for Tony Pulis. Hammers boss Allardyce only clung onto his job in the summer after promising the West Ham board more expansive, attacking football. Allardyce's attacking revolution failed to bear fruit on the season's opening day in a frustrating 1-0 Upton Park defeat to Tottenham, with the Hammers spurning a host of half-chances. Former Lazio poacher Zarate was able to cut West Ham's toothless finishing short at Selhurst Park however, capping a lively full debut with a smart first-half finish. Stewart Downing: Practice makes perfect Stewart Downing: Practice makes perfect Former Middlesbrough wing Downing claimed just his second West Ham goal moments later, as Palace paid the price for backing off in midfield. Downing raced down the right, cut off his flank and nudged a side-footed effort past the blameless Speroni. James Tomkins headed against the crossbar to open the second half as West Ham sought to kill off the contest, but Palace immediately seized on the reprieve, with former Arsenal forward Chamakh firing in a low shot from 20 yards to half the deficit. Bannan blasted straight at Adrian from the edge of the area, but just when the hosts scented level terms West Ham struck again with striker Cole, so profligate against Spurs, who pounced on a loose ball in the Palace box to lash past Speroni and kill the contest. Sam Allardyce: West Ham were tactically outstanding Sam Allardyce: West Ham were tactically outstanding Palace's Co-chairman Steve Parish was joined by former Palace striker Mark Bright in the directors' box, and no doubt the pair had plenty to discuss. Parish was all set to hand Malky Mackay the reins to replace Pulis, who walked out on the eve of the season after rows over transfer policy. Mackay fell out of the running after the FA launched an investigation into racist, sexist and homophobic text messages sent during his time as Cardiff manager. Tim Sherwood pulled out of the running for the Palace job after initially being deemed second choice to Mackay, leaving Millen to take charge for the second week running. Keith Millen: Been a difficult week Keith Millen: Been a difficult week While West Ham can look towards Cole and Zarate forging a dangerous strike partnership, Palace know time is running out for transfer recruits with the window closing on September 1. Millen has admitted he will spearhead Palace's recruitment drive in the absence of both Pulis and now Moody. Co-chairman Parish must now act swiftly to secure a new managerial appointment however, with Palace already battling to set their season on track. PAUL MERSON ON PALACE v WEST HAM The Palace players look a bit lost if I’m being honest. There wasn’t a lot of shape about the team. Over the last six months if you have gone to Palace you’ve had to work very hard, but when West Ham got on top they stayed there. Palace were begging for half-time because they were all over the place. They need to get someone in very soon or sort something out. Before the game I would have said yes to Keith Millen, but when you watch that today then maybe no. It wasn’t the Tony Pulis team. That’s the problem, he’s got to get them hard to beat again."},{"date": "23/08/2015", "arena": " Mary's Stadium", "attendance": 27598, "home_team": {"name": "Southampton", "lineup": [{"name": "Fraser Forster", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathaniel Clyne", "yellows": [66], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "José Fonte", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Maya Yoshida", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Bertrand", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Morgan Schneiderlin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Wanyama", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Davis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "James Ward-Prowse", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [78]}, {"name": "Dusan Tadic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Graziano Pellè", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Kelvin Davis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Florin Gardos", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shane Long", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Atila Turan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Cork", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [78], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jos Hooiveld", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lloyd Isgrove", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "West Bromwich Albion", "lineup": [{"name": "Ben Foster", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andre Wisdom", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Craig Dawson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonas Olsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sébastien Pocognoli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [60]}, {"name": "Saido Berahino", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [89]}, {"name": "Craig Gardner", "yellows": [80], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Youssouf Mulumbu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Brunt", "yellows": [42], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Graham Dorrans", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Anichebe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [52]}], "subs": [{"name": "Chris Baird", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Claudio Yacob", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Brown Ideye", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [52], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Boaz Myhill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jason Davidson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [60], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gareth McAuley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stéphane Sessegnon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [89], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Ryan Bertrand and Saido Berahino: Battle during dogged draw Southampton and West Bromwich Albion cancelled each other out as they were involved in an uneventful 0-0 draw at St Mary's.

Best of the match Man of the match: Youssouf Mulumbu. Prevented Southampton from creating anything in midfield. Save of the match: Fraser Forster spread himself really well after Brown Ideye had spun in behind the Southampton defence. Moment of the match: James Ward-Prowse came within the width of the post of sending a dipping free-kick past a sprawling Ben Foster. Talking point: Have Southampton got enough firepower to cause opponents problems? What should West Brom be looking to achieve this season? Changes after the interval improved things slightly, with big-money signing Brown Ideye handed his Premier League bow by West Brom and showed glimpses of what he might be capable of when up to full speed – with one close-range effort well blocked by Fraser Forster. James Ward-Prowse also clipped the outside of the post with a dipping free-kick, but there was to be no breakthrough and the points were shared. The game proved to be a missed opportunity for new Southampton manager Ronald Koeman and his summer recruits to show Saints fans they are moving on from a summer of upheaval. Having impressed for large parts of their opening defeat at Liverpool, Koeman warned other clubs would have taken note of how good his side are. But it was the visitors who started well at St Mary's, with Alan Irvine's charges also looking to make an impact. Baggies' captain Chris Brunt had a shout for a penalty as early as the second minute, but referee Roger East was unmoved as he fell inside the area while looking to turn the Southampton defence. Ben Foster: Kept a clean sheet Responsibility Brunt was involved again shortly afterwards as his cross was met by Victor Anichebe, who reacted quickest to swing a boot at the ball, only to see his effort fly wide. With former West Brom striker Shane Long again only starting from the bench for Koeman's side, fellow summer signing Pelle was given the responsibility of operating as the main forward. The former Italy Under-21 international had Southampton's first chance of the game, but could only glance an eighth-minute header wide of a post. But again it was the travelling fans who saw their side come close to breaking the deadlock as Graeme Dorrans had his low shot bravely blocked by Saints captain Jose Fonte. Southampton started to turn the tide in their favour and it was Jonas Olsson who had to block Pelle's effort after good work down the left by Ryan Bertrand. Ronald Koeman was disappointed with his side's performance in the 0-0 draw against West Brom, but is hoping to strengthen his side before the transfer wind Ronald Koeman was disappointed with his side's performance in the 0-0 draw against West Brom, but is hoping to strengthen his side before the transfer wind Pelle was again involved as Tadic's cross drifted just too high for the ex-Feyenoord man to reach, with West Brom goalkeeper Ben Foster caught in no-man's land after a mix-up with Andre Wisdom. England international Foster was on hand to make the first real save of the game as he pushed away Tadic's close-range effort after the Serbia international had done well to initially win the ball back. Unchallenged Long was introduced at the break in place of Steven Davis, with Ideye brought on for his Baggies debut 10 minutes later. But it was Tadic who wasted the best chance in the early stages of the second half, drifting inside unchallenged before rolling a tame shot at Foster. Alan Irvine expects big things from record signing Brown Ideye, and looks to add two new faces to his squad. Alan Irvine expects big things from record signing Brown Ideye, and looks to add two new faces to his squad. West Brom hit their hosts on the break and Sebastien Pocognoli's deep cross was headed into the side-netting by Ideye. That proved to be Pocognoli's last contribution as the Belgium international was forced off, with Jason Davidson, another debutant, taking his place. Tadic was proving to be the man most likely to make something happen and he came close to his first Saints goal after drilling Long's knock-down narrowly wide. With Southampton starting to ask more questions, James Ward-Prowse hit the outside of a post with a bending free-kick, with Foster seemingly well-beaten. Irvine's side were dangerous when they went forward and Ideye continued to impress as he turned Fonte inside the box and forced the best save of the match out of a sprawling Forster. Phil Thompson provides feedback on a quiet afternoon at St Mary's as Southampton played out a nil nil draw against West Brom Phil Thompson provides feedback on a quiet afternoon at St Mary's as Southampton played out a nil nil draw against West Brom But neither side could fashion a chance to take all three points with a late winner, with a point apiece a fair reflection of a forgettable afternoon. Phil Thompson on Southampton v West Brom Both sides were giving the ball away, but you were looking at Southampton, as the home team, to make all the play. With Pelle being up front they’ve got no pace whatsoever with nobody running in behind. That means that if you can’t keep the ball to build up, you’ve got a problem.

Nathan Dyer’s opener was Swansea at their counter-attacking best as Gylfi Sigurdsson’s through ball cut out the Burnley defence to set the winger free and fire them into a 23rd-minute lead. Save of the Match: Burnley pressed throughout the second half and home debutant Lukas Fabianski had to be alert to deny David Jones from inside the area with a fine save down to his left. Burnley did threaten in spells as Ings fired over before Lukasz Fabianski cut out his low cross looking for Lukas Jutkiewicz, while Tom Heaton denied Gylfi Sigurdsson from inside the area with a comfortable save following Wayne Routledge’s low cross. Swansea took the lead on the 23rd minute and the lively Sigurdsson, making his second home debut for the club following his summer switch from Tottenham, cut apart the Burnley defence as Nathan Dyer raced onto his through ball to fire beyond Heaton. Burnley were the better side for the majority of the second half with Jutkiewicz, Scott Arfield and Ings all threatening in the early stages. Jutkiewicz spurned their best chance when he headed Dean Marney's deep cross over the bar after losing his marker. David Jones then burst into the Swansea box and Fabianski was forced into a fine save to tip his low strike wide after some smart play from Ings before subsitute Ashley Barnes fired over in stoppage time, but Garry Monk's side held on to make it two wins from their opening two games. The hosts were unchanged following their shock victory at Old Trafford, with midweek signings Federico Fernandez and Tom Carroll introduced to the crowd ahead of kick-off but not included in the matchday squad. Burnley were also unchanged from their 3-1 home defeat to Chelsea as Sean Dyche's men looked to get their first points on the board following promotion from the Championship. Swansea went close to taking a third-minute lead when Wayne Routledge's cross found Bony 12 yards out. The Ivorian's header seemed destined for the far corner of the net with Heaton sprawling, only for Shackell's precious interception to keep him out. Burnley were not shy in coming forward and Ings was lively as he played off summer signing Jutkiewicz in attack. The England Under-21s striker volleyed over from just inside the box after Jonjo Shelvey had been dispossessed before another quick attack saw his cutback grasped by the grateful Fabianski with Jutkiewicz lurking. Garry Monk was happy with his side's defensive display against Burnley Garry Monk was happy with his side's defensive display against Burnley Shelvey soon forgot about his earlier error, though, as he got Swansea moving with a raking 40-yard pass which released Routledge down the right. Routledge sped past Kieran Trippier to deliver the perfect ball for Sigurdsson but the Icelandic midfielder's shot lacked power and Tom Heaton held on. But Heaton was beaten five minutes later as Ben Mee failed to intercept Sigurdsson's ball and Dyer advanced to beat the former Manchester United trainee inside his near post with a low drive. The goal settled Swansea down and Bony began to flex his considerable muscles but Burnley were well-organised and refused to yield too much space. Sean Dyche says his side showed too much respect to Swansea in the first half Sean Dyche says his side showed too much respect to Swansea in the first half Sigurdsson volleyed over from the edge of the area following a poor clearance from Michael Duff, who was making his 500th career appearance, and Bony's weak shot was comfortably held by Heaton before the break. Bony had another chance straight after the restart when Dean Marney's loose header fell into his path but was unable to capitalise with a horrible mis-kick as he bore down on goal. But Burnley were still very much in the game and Jutkiewicz felt he should have had a penalty after more good work by Ings, although television replays showed Ashley Williams made contact with the ball. Scott Arfield and Marney both saw wayward efforts fly wide and Ings' drive was deflected wide as the home crowd began to get restless. And Burnley should have been level when Marney's 64th-minute cross picked out the unmarked Jutkiewicz but he could only head over Fabianski's bar after ghosting free.

Charlie Nicholas talks to Jeff Stelling about the game at the Liberty Stadium where Swansea maintained their 100% start as they took on Burnley. Garry Monk had seen enough and sent on Bafetimbi Gomis and Jefferson Montero for Bony and Dyer - but Burnley were within inches of equalising when Ings found David Jones and his shot was saved by Fabianski, with the ball just evading Jutkiewicz, who slid in at the far post. Swansea almost released the pressure valve when Montero's cross was punched out by Heaton and Ki Sung-yeung's rising drive just cleared the crossbar. Burnley continued to press in the final minutes and Barnes, a January signing from Brighton, lashed over the bar as Swansea edged to the three points. Charlie Nicholas on Swansea v Burnley I thought Burnley deserved something from this, but they walk away with nothing. In the first half Swansea bossed it and I don’t know what Sean Dyche said to them, but in the second half they upped the tempo, drove forward and pinned Swansea in. They were the better team in the second half, but didn’t make a bundle of chances. If it had gone 1-1 they might have gone on and nicked it. It was a cracking game to watch and both teams were very good, but I would have to say that Burnley will be disappointed not to get anything from it. I like a lot of Swansea’s signings. I don’t see them being anywhere close to a scrap. What a sensational start it is for them."},{"date": "23/08/2015", "arena": "Goodison Park", "attendance": 39490, "home_team": {"name": "Everton", "lineup": [{"name": "Tim Howard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Seamus Coleman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Jagielka", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sylvain Distin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leighton Baines", "yellows": [29], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James McCarthy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gareth Barry", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin Mirallas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [85]}, {"name": "Steven Naismith", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Pienaar", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [10]}, {"name": "Romelu Lukaku", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [76]}], "subs": [{"name": "Joel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aiden McGeady", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [76], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Muhamed Besic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Atsu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [85], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leon Osman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [10], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Stones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Antolin Alcaraz", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Arsenal", "lineup": [{"name": "Wojciech Szczesny", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mathieu Debuchy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Calum Chambers", "yellows": [57], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Per Mertesacker", "yellows": [43], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nacho Monreal", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mathieu Flamini", "yellows": [77], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [74]}, {"name": "Aaron Ramsey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Wilshere", "yellows": [54], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [74]}, {"name": "Mesut Özil", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alexis Sánchez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}], "subs": [{"name": "Laurent Koscielny", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tomas Rosicky", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Olivier Giroud", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Santi Cazorla", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [74], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Emiliano Martinez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joel Campbell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [74], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Hector Bellerin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Olivier Giroud celebrates his late equaliser Arsenal scored two late goals as they came from behind in a gripping encounter at Goodison Park to hold Everton to a 2-2 draw. Seamus Coleman opened the scoring in the 19th minute with a header from Gareth Barry’s pass and Steven Naismith tucked away a second just before half-time following great play by Romelu Lukaku, although replays showed the goal should have been chalked off for offside. Watch the SNF analysis of Arsenal's 2-2 draw at Everton Watch the SNF analysis of Arsenal's 2-2 draw at Everton Everton continued to look comfortable until deep in the second half, but then with seven minutes remaining Aaron Ramsey tapped in from close range from Santi Cazorla’s cross. Olivier Giroud, who only came on at half-time for Alexis Sanchez, then headed in to salvage an unlikely point for Arsenal in the 90th minute. Arsenal had the better of the opening 15 minutes, but it quickly became apparent they were lacking a clinical edge. Ramsey tried to carve open the home defence with a series of cutting passes, and there were plenty of fancy touches from Sanchez, who harassed the home defence with his pace, but Tim Howard remained untested in the Everton goal. Best of the match Man of the match: Olivier Giroud. His introduction gave Arsenal a different option up front and he was a constant handful before heading home the late equaliser. Moment of the match: Everton appeared set for victory until the final few minutes but they had to settle for a point as Giroud expertly headed in Nacho Monreal’s late cross. Goal of the match: The opening goal was well worked as Gareth Barry clipped a delightful pass to the back post for Seamus Coleman to nod home. Talking point: Does Arsenal’s fightback prove that they have the character to challenge for the title? Where did it all go wrong for Everton? The only chance Arsenal mustered in the first half came when Coleman cleared straight to Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. Luckily for the hosts, the England winger side-footed wide. It took just a couple of minutes for Coleman to get back into Roberto Martinez's good books. The Republic of Ireland full-back climbed high at the back post to nod Barry's delicate chip past Wojciech Szczesny and give Everton the lead. Lukaku played a part in the goal, selflessly ducking to give Coleman a clear header, and Mesut Ozil gave Everton a helping hand with some sloppy marking. Arsenal were rattled, and they almost went 2-0 down moments later. Naismith looped a header over Calum Chambers and straight into the path of Kevin Mirallas, but his shot trickled inches wide. Chambers then carelessly clattered into Mirallas, giving Everton a free-kick on the edge of the box. Mirallas bent the resulting free-kick up and over the wall, and the Everton fans rose to their feet thinking the Belgian had scored, but the ball had instead rippled the side-netting. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger vented his anger at referee Kevin Friend for booking Per Mertesacker after a foul on Naismith. Fightback encourages Wenger Fightback encourages Wenger And the Frenchman's mood darkened just before the break when Everton doubled their lead. Lukaku shrugged off Mertesacker inside the Everton half and hurdled the sliding challenge of Chambers before sprinting at the Arsenal defence on the break. The Belgian cleverly cut inside from the right flank and flicked the ball through to Naismith, who beat Szczesny from close range. It was a beautiful goal, but one that should have been ruled out for offside, replays showed. Wenger had seen enough of Sanchez and replaced him with Giroud at half-time, but Arsenal's misery continued. Martinez happy despite draw Martinez happy despite draw Giroud managed to blast a volley over from close range just 58 seconds after his introduction. Jack Wilshere was lucky to escape with a yellow card for a late sliding challenge on Barry. Mathieu Debuchy followed him into the book with a petty challenge on Naismith. Arsenal dominated possession, but they still did not look like scoring. Howard made his first save of the match in the 68th minute from Giroud, who rolled a weak shot into the American's hands from 12 yards. Flamini delighted Flamini delighted Wenger looked to inject some life into his side by replacing Wilshere and Oxlade-Chamberlain with Cazorla and Joel Campbell. Arsenal finally found the net with seven minutes to go. Cazorla flashed a low ball across the box in front of six Everton players, and Ramsey prodded home. A cagey atmosphere descended upon Goodison Park, and the home fans breathed a huge sigh of relief as Giroud wasted a good chance to level with a free header. The Frenchman had the last laugh, though, stunning the home crowd into silence with a last-minute header from Nacho Monreal's cross."},{"date": "18/08/2015", "arena": "Turf Moor", "attendance": 20699, "home_team": {"name": "Burnley", "lineup": [{"name": "Tom Heaton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kieran Trippier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Duff", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jason Shackell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Mee", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Scott Arfield", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dean Marney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Jones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matthew Taylor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [70]}, {"name": "Danny Ings", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [82]}, {"name": "Lukas Jutkiewicz", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [70]}], "subs": [{"name": "Ross Wallace", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Kightly", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [70], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marvin Sordell", "yellows": [87], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [82], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matthew Gilks", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin Long", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Barnes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [70], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cameron Dummigan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Chelsea", "lineup": [{"name": "Thibaut Courtois", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Branislav Ivanovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gary Cahill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Terry", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "César Azpilicueta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cesc Fàbregas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nemanja Matic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "André Schürrle", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [78]}, {"name": "Oscar", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [82]}, {"name": "Eden Hazard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [84]}, {"name": "Diego Costa", "yellows": [31], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Petr Cech", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Filipe Luis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kurt Zouma", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fernando Torres", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Didier Drogba", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [84], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Mikel Obi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [82], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willian", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [78], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Diego Costa: Celebrates Chelsea's third at Burnley Chelsea survived an early scare to convincingly sweep aside a determined Burnley side and earn a 3-1 victory at Turf Moor.

Moment of the Match: Diego Costa booking. Was there contact? Talking Points: Did Chelsea show why they are title favourites? Did Diego Costa do enough to suggest he'll be a hit? Will Cech stay? Burnley did okay, will they stay up? Not content there, the Premier League title favourites notched a third in the 34th minute, with Ivanovic getting in on the act. As a result, the second half was not much of a spectacle, with Chelsea happy to take their foot off the gas whilst simultaneously keeping a dogged Burnley side at bay. A booking for Costa was the only sour point in what was an impressive performance from the Blues, and sent a clear message to their title rivals in the process. Jose Mourinho has a habit of grabbing the headlines, and he certainly did that prior to kick-off, as it was announced Courtois would start in place of Cech in the Blues’ goal. And after Burnley had soaked up early pressure, Courtois’ first job was to pick the ball out of his net. Mourinho hopes Cech stays, and says Blues will appeal Costa booking Mourinho hopes Cech stays, and says Blues will appeal Costa booking A left-wing corner was not properly cleared by the Blues' backline, with the ball played back into the feet of Arfield, who had the time and space to pick his spot past the Belgian stopper from the edge of the box. The Clarets’ goal certainly jolted Mourinho’s men into life, and they were level just four minutes later. Dyche: Burnley showed desire Dyche: Burnley showed desire Ivanovic was picked out on the right wing, and his low cross, whilst being poorly directed, almost caught Burnley goalkeeper Tom Heaton out, but the ball ricocheted into the path of Costa, who swivelled and fired the Blues level from eight yards. Then came a thing of beauty. Ivanonic picked Fabregas out on the edge of the home side’s box, and whilst shaping to shoot, delightfully laid the ball through to Schurrle, who finished brilliantly on the run. The action was relentless at this point. Minutes later came arguably the game's major talking point. Costa latched onto a woeful backpass from Ben Mee, knocked the ball past Heaton, who seemed to catch the Spanish striker, but referee Michael Oliver adjudged Costa's tumble to be simulated, and booked him for diving, much to his and his manager's surprise. However, a third goal soon followed, with Ivanovic on the end of the move this time, volleying in from six yards from a Fabregas corner, although Sean Dyche would not have been happy with Burnley’s lacklustre marking. Reaction from Terry and Fabregas Reaction from Terry and Fabregas The second half offered little in the way of goalmouth action as Chelsea took a step back. Courtois was called into action by the impressive Arfield, who brought the best out of the Belgian, who was at full stretch to tip a fine strike over the bar. Didier Drogba's late appearance got the away fans' pulses racing, but the result, and the emphatic response to falling behind, certainly reiterated many experts' view that this Chelsea side is the team to beat this season."},{"date": "17/08/2015", "arena": "Anfield", "attendance": 44736, "home_team": {"name": "Liverpool", "lineup": [{"name": "Simon Mignolet", "yellows": [], "reds": [],

opener against Southampton Liverpool opened their Premier League campaign with a 2-1 win over Southampton at Anfield thanks to goals from Raheem Sterling and Daniel Sturridge. Sterling latched on to a defence-splitting pass from Jordan Henderson midway through the first half as he got his season off to a dream start with a composed finish beyond debutant goalkeeper Fraser Forster. Ronald Koeman's men did threaten with James Ward-Prowse and Morgan Schneiderlin forcing saves out of Simon Mignolet, but it was Nathaniel Clyne who pulled them level with an emphatic finish just after half-time. Watch the Super Sunday panel's analysis of Sterling's display and see both Liverpool goals Watch the Super Sunday panel's analysis of Sterling's display and see both Liverpool goals The Saints looked the most likely to take all three points for the majority of the second half but Sturridge ensured Liverpool got off to a winning start with a close-range finish on 79 minutes. Brendan Rodgers handed Liverpool debuts to Dejan Lovren and Javi Manquillo, but fellow summer signings Rickie Lambert and Emre Can were forced to settle for places on the bench. Forster, Ryan Bertrand, Dusan Tadic and Graziano Pelle made their competitive bows for the visitors, while Shane Long and Saphir Taider were named among their substitutes.

Debutant Shane Long really should have equalised three minutes from time when Schneiderlin’s strike rocketed off the bar and into his path, but the Irishman could only nod wide from close range. Pass of the Match: Jordan Henderson took out the entire Southampton with an inch-perfect through ball that Gerrard would have been proud of for Sterling’s first-half opener. The hosts started brightly and began to dominate possession without really testing Forster. Sturridge and Sterling both looked lively in attack as Rodgers’ side patiently probed for an opening. That eventually came through Sterling’s cool finish on the 23rd minute, but the 19-year-old owed a lot to his England team-mate Henderson for the through-ball which set him free on goal. Henderson, who started alongside Steven Gerrard and Lucas Leiva in a three-man midfield, picked up the ball from deep and was able to cut through the Saints defence with an inch-perfect pass, finding the well-timed run of Sterling to slot beyond Forster. Southampton responded in a fairly positive manner as debutant Pelle steered Schneiderlin’s low cross over the bar under heavy pressure from Lovren, before James Ward-Prowse almost caught Mignolet off guard. Big things are expected of the 19-year-old midfielder this season and he was inches away from an equaliser as his wicked free-kick from the right sailed towards the far post, forcing a backpedalling Mignolet to tip behind for a corner. Mignolet was then equal to Ward-Prowse’s curling effort from range with a comfortable save as the visitors looked to end the opening 45 minutes on a positive note. Schneiderlin, who handed in a transfer request earlier this summer to try and force a move to Spurs, was hardly putting in the display of an unsettled player and he had Southampton's best chance of the half as Mignolet acrobatically tipped his strike over the bar. Rodgers hails Reds' character Rodgers hails Reds' character Sterling then had chances either side of the break as he stung the palms of Forster before blazing a strike well over the bar from range. Koeman's side started the second half brightly with Victor Wanyama dragging a shot wide and they soon found themselves level through the unlikely source of right-back Clyne. Tadic had largely cut a frustrated figure for almost an hour into his Saints debut but he showed why a fee in excess of £8million was paid for his services as he backheeled into the path of Clyne, who sent Mignolet the wrong way. Koeman left disappointed Koeman left disappointed The goal appeared to put Southampton into the ascedancy as they enjoyed the better of the play and an unmarked Steven Davis should have fired them ahead shorlty after the equaliser as Ward-Prowse teed him up for a strike which Mignolet was equal to. Clyne made another marauding run into the area but was crowded out by a combination of Martin Skrtel and Glen Johnson, before Long, a £12million signing from Hull earlier in the week, was introduced for his debut on 73 minutes as Saints started to believe they could take all three points. SAS back with a bang SAS back with a bang However, shortly after the arrival of Lambert for his Liverpool bow, it was the hosts who got the decisive goal as Sturridge got the deftest of touches on Sterling's return header to guide it beyond Forster. Henderson's intial cross was headed clear and up into the air, but Sterling climbed highest to nod it back towards goal where Sturridge was lurking to get off the mark for the season. There was still drama to come at the opposite end as Schneiderlin rattled the bar with a powerful strike and Long could only nod the rebound wide from six yards as Liverpool held off some late

Newcastle competed well in an absorbing Premier League encounter but fell behind in the 38th minute on Sunday when David Silva slotted home a calm finish from Edin Dzeko's exquisite back-heel. Watch the Super Sunday panel's analysis of Dzeko and see Silva's goal Watch the Super Sunday panel's analysis of Dzeko and see Silva's goal Man City had to defend for long periods in the second half and Newcastle almost grabbed an equaliser when Ayoze Perez’s shot was deflected just wide. However, City made sure of victory in stoppage-time as substitute Sergio Aguero fired in on the rebound after his initial shot had been saved. The afternoon started with captains Fabricio Coloccini and Vincent Kompany, along with former Sunderland goalkeeper Jimmy Montgomery, laying wreaths on the centre circle as they were joined by relatives of fans John Alder and Liam Sweeney, who died on Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17. Best of the match Man of the match: Edin Dzeko. The Man City striker created the opening goal with a wonderful back-heel and led the line well all afternoon. Moment of the match: Newcastle nearly levelled when substitute Ayoze Perez burst through late on, but his shot took a crucial touch off Fernando to go wide. Goal of the match: Man City took the lead with a stylish goal as Dzeko cleverly flicked the ball back to Silva after latching on to Yaya Toure’s long pass, and the Spaniard showed great composure to finish. Talking point: Can Newcastle think of Europe after an encouraging performance? Do Man City need more signings before the transfer deadline? But while City played their full part in an emotional start to the afternoon, they ripped into their hosts from the off and might have established a commanding lead within the opening 11 minutes. Goalkeeper Tim Krul had to be at his most alert to keep out Dzeko's close-range second-minute effort after Stevan Jovetic had played him in over the top with a delicately lofted pass, and the Dutchman was in action once again nine minutes later. Samir Nasri and Aleksandar Kolarov played a long-range one-two before the Frenchman teed himself up to unleash a rasping drive which Krul had to dive full-length to turn away. But as they warmed to their task, the Magpies started to make an impact. Pellegrini happy with victory Pellegrini happy with victory Coloccini and central defensive partner Mike Williamson managed to get to grips with Dzeko and Jovetic to allow the men in front of them to prosper, although, while there were flashes from Remy Cabella and Emmanuel Riviere and a series of surging runs from Moussa Sissoko, there was little of note to trouble Joe Hart. Cabella drifted a chipped 16th-minute effort over Hart's crossbar and Riviere, who showed plenty of endeavour, but slightly less composure, scuffed wide from distance and blazed across goal when he might have done better. At the other end, Williamson denied Jovetic with a perfectly timed block, but the respite was temporary and City took the lead with seven minutes of the half remaining. Pardew praises players Pardew praises players Coloccini and Williamson were both drawn to Dzeko as he chased down a long ball, and both were left stranded when he cleverly back-heeled it between them for Silva to exploit the space and fire left-footed past Krul. Newcastle responded in determined fashion immediately after the restart with Yoan Gouffran seeing two shots blocked in quick succession after Jack Colback's 50th-minute corner reached him beyond the far post, and Cabella scooped over under pressure from Sissoko's pass. Full-back Paul Dummett headed over after reaching Colback's corner ahead of Hart, but it took a good block by Coloccini to prevent Jovetic from extending the visitors' lead on the hour. Dzeko and Clichy: City deserved win Dzeko and Clichy: City deserved win Dzeko headed onto the roof of Krul's net 25 minutes from time and Yaya Toure, who endured one of his quieter afternoons, floated a free-kick just over eight minutes later. The Magpies threw caution to the wind as time ran down and substitute Perez saw a shot deflected just wide of the far post before Sissoko blazed wastefully over at the death. But substitute Aguero wrapped up the win in stoppage time when, after Krul had blocked his initial effort, he stabbed the rebound home from close range."},{"date": "16/08/2015", "arena": "Old Trafford", "attendance": 75339, "home_team": {"name": "Manchester United", "lineup": [{"name": "David De Gea", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Jones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Smalling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tyler Blackett", "yellows": [83], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jesse Lingard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [24]}, {"name": "Darren Fletcher", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ander Herrera", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [67]}, {"name": "Ashley Young", "yellows": [86], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Juan Mata", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Javier Hernández", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Wayne Rooney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Adnan Januzaj", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [24], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nani", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shinji Kagawa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marouane Fellaini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [67], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Keane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Amos", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Reece James", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Swansea City", "lineup": [{"name": "Lukasz Fabianski", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Angel Rangel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordi Amat", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Williams", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Neil Taylor", "yellows": [48], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [53]}, {"name": "Sung-Yueng Ki", "yellows": [82], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonjo Shelvey", "yellows": [54], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathan Dyer", "yellows": [26], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [67]}, {"name": "Gylfi Sigurdsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wayne Routledge", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wilfried Bony", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [77]}], "subs": [{"name": "Bafétimbi Gomis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [77], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dwight Tiendalli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [53], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jefferson Montero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [67], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gerhard Tremmel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Bartley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jazz Richards", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Josh Sheehan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Swansea City ruined Louis van Gaal’s first game as Manchester United manager after claiming a shock 2-1 victory at Old Trafford.

Goal of the Game: Ki’s opener was a splendid team effort to open up the United defence and rounded off with a precise finish Attempt of the match: Wayne Rooney’s free-kick that just clipped the woodwork with Fabianski looking beaten Moment of the match: 11th hour penalty shout from United that could have given them the chance of a point but Angel Rangel got away with an errant arm Talking point: Obviously Louis van Gaal's response to this opening setback. But plenty of credit to Swansea boss Garry Monk, who put out a team that did more than just nick this and were well worth their three points. Louis van Gaal brought Nani on for Javier Hernandez at half-time, ditching his 3-5-2 formation in the process, and saw United equalise within eight minutes of the restart. Juan Mata’s corner was helped on at the near post by Phil Jones and newly-appointed captain Rooney’s overhead kick from close range flew into the net. Rooney struck the outside of the post with a 25-yard free-kick on 66 minutes before Swansea regained the lead on 72 minutes when Sigurdsson finished after Wayne Routledge’s mis-kicked shot dropped into his path. United substitute Marouane Fellaini’s only contribution was to escape censure for flicking out an arm at Ki as Swansea comfortably held out to claim a first league win at Old Trafford after beating the Red Devils in the FA Cup third round last season. A wave of noise greeted Van Gaal and his players as they emerged from the tunnel to signal the start of a new chapter in United's rich history. Any of the 75,339 fans inside Old Trafford expecting a lightning start to this Premier League season were left disappointed as a dull opening 15 minutes ensued. Swansea did manage to test United's new-look three-man defence on a couple of occasions. Routledge raced on to Jonjo Shelvey's through-ball, but De Gea came to the rescue. Routledge then gave Jones the slip down United's right, but his cross was cut out just before Wilfried Bony could convert. Rooney led by example as he tried to drag United into the game. The new United captain tore around the pitch, but his two first-half attempts on goal were weak. Lingard, making his full United debut, was replaced by Januzaj after injuring his right foot in a challenge with Ashley Williams. Finally, with 24 minutes on the clock, Swansea goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski was tested for the first time when he saved Jones' blistering shot after a clever one-two with Mata. Louis van Gaal says Manchester United's 2-1 defeat against Swansea is very disappointing, especially after such success in pre-season, but insists it is on Louis van Gaal says Manchester United's 2-1 defeat against Swansea is very disappointing, especially after such success in pre-season, but insists it is on Then, four minutes later, Old Trafford fell silent as Swansea took the lead. Tyler Blackett was drawn out of position by Nathan Dyer, who laid the ball off to Sigurdsson and the Iceland international squared to Ki, who fired the ball past a diving De Gea. Bony played an important part in the goal, blocking Jones as he rushed out to challenge the South Korean goal scorer. Van Gaal sought to inject life into his team at the interval by bringing Nani on for the ineffective Hernandez, who started up front ahead of the unfit Robin van Persie. Within eight minutes of the restart the hosts were level. Jones climbed well to flick on Mata's corner and Rooney acrobatically swept the ball past Fabianski. Raucous celebrations ensued on the United bench, but Van Gaal simply recorded the goal on his notepad and looked up with a blank expression. Neil Taylor went in to the book for hacking down Januzaj and Mike Dean also issued a caution to Shelvey for kicking the ball away following a late tackle on Mata. Rooney turned Williams with an exquisite bit of skill, but the Swansea captain recovered to deny the England striker. Rooney then came agonisingly close to putting United ahead with a brilliant free-kick. After being hacked down by Jordi Amat on the edge of the area, the United captain curled a shot up and over the wall, but the ball struck the frame and bounced wide. In the 72nd minute, Routledge mis-hit Jefferson Montero's cross. Fortunately for Swansea, the ball fell at the feet of Sigurdsson, who bundled the ball past De Gea. United had a late penalty appeal turned down as Dean waved play on and Swansea held on for their first league win at Old Trafford."},{"date": "16/08/2015", "arena": "The King Power Stadium", "attendance": 31603, "home_team": {"name": "Leicester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Kasper Schmeichel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ritchie de Laet", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wes Morgan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Liam Moore", "yellows": [71], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paul Konchesky", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Riyad Mahrez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andy King", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Drinkwater", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [39]}, {"name": "Anthony Knockaert", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [64]}, {"name": "Leonardo Ulloa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [78]}, {"name": "David Nugent", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Dean Hammond", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [39], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Hamer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jeffrey Schlupp", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [64], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Hopper", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gary Taylor-Fletcher", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marcin Wasilewski", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Wood", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [78], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Everton", "lineup": [{"name": "Tim Howard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Stones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Jagielka", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sylvain Distin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leighton Baines", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James McCarthy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gareth Barry", "yellows": [68], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aiden McGeady", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [85]}, {"name": "Steven Naismith", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Pienaar", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [81]}, {"name": "Romelu Lukaku", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Joel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin Mirallas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [81], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Muhamed Besic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Atsu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leon Osman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Seamus Coleman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [85], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Antolin Alcaraz", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Leicester City twice came from behind to draw 2-2 with Everton at the King Power Stadium in their first Premier League game for a decade. Chris Wood, who was recently wanted by Wolves, earned Leicester a point four minutes from time after Steven Naismith had restored Everton’s advantage just before half-time. Summer signing Leonardo Ulloa had earlier hauled Leicester back on level terms just two minutes after Everton had gone in front through Aiden McGeady’s cracker. Best of the Match Man of the match: Liam Moore was terrific defensively for Leicester, making some crucial interventions to deny conceding more goals. Goal of the match: Aiden McGeady opening the scoring with a cracking curling effort that cracked off the far post. Attempt of the match: Steven Naismith skewing an effort just wide of the post after a poor clearance from a Romelu Lukaku header. Moment of the match: Chris Wood coming up big for Leicester City with a crucial goal to tie it up in the dying embers of the game. Talking point: Chris Wood's huge goal in the 86th minute to earn Leicester their first Premier League point in a decade. Everton took the lead on 20 minutes when Leighton Baines’ low shot from distance deflected into the path of Sylvain Distin, who was denied by Kasper Schmeichel, but the ball broke to McGeady to curl a stunning shot into the top corner. Leicester equalised just two minutes later when Distin’s clearance from a corner struck Ulloa and the hosts’ record signing flashed his shot past Tim Howard. But Everton regained the lead at the end of the first half when Baines’ cut-back was touched on by Steven Pienaar and Naismith swept a first-time shot in off the crossbar. Last season’s Championship winners should have equalised when Jeffrey Schlupp was sent clean through, but the substitute wildly fired his shot from the edge of the area into the crowd. Gareth Barry was fortunate not to be shown a second yellow card before Leicester equalised again with four minutes to go when Wood rolled a shot past Howard after the ball had broken kindly for the substitute. Roberto Martinez's Everton team featured no new faces, although Romelu Lukaku and Gareth Barry both made their first appearances since joining permanently. John Stones stepped in at right-back for Seamus Coleman, who was only fit enough for the bench, while new signings Muhamed Besic and Christian Atsu were both unused substitutes. Ross Barkley's injury certainly cast a cloud over the start of Everton's season, the England midfielder sustaining medial knee ligament damage in training. Leicester manager Nigel Pearson was pleased with his player's response after his side grabbed a late equaliser against Everton. Leicester manager Nigel Pearson was pleased with his player's response after his side grabbed a late equaliser against Everton. Nothing could dampen Leicester's enthusiasm for their first Premier League season in 10 years, although they too were hit by injuries, with Marc Albrighton, Jamie Vardy and Matthew Upson all sidelined. The hosts more than held their own in an even start and Howard had two nervy moments, first flapping at an Anthony Knockaert cross and then hesitating over a long ball and almost allowing Ulloa in. But it was Everton who opened the scoring in the 20th minute, exploiting a fortunate deflection to the full. Baines' long-distance shot did not look set to pose any problems until it was half blocked on the edge of the area and fell for Distin 15 yards out. The defender's shot was saved by Schmeichel, but the goalkeeper could only watch as McGeady's delightful effort from the left curled over him and into the top corner. Chris Woods was the hero for Leicester City after he grabbed a late equaliser in their 2-2 draw with Everton. Chris Woods was the hero for Leicester City after he grabbed a late equaliser in their 2-2 draw with Everton. But back came Leicester and within two minutes they were level. The Foxes had already demonstrated their threat from set-pieces and, when Everton failed to clear a corner, record signing Ulloa repaid some of his transfer fee with a well-struck shot from the middle of the box. Two minutes later Everton thought they had gone back ahead when Baines set up Naismith, but the ball had clearly gone behind before the defender played it. Baines was a real thorn in Leicester's side and he wanted a penalty after going down in the area under pressure from Knockaert, but referee Mike Jones decided any contact had been accidental. Everton began to gradually assert their dominance as the half went on and Schmeichel was relieved to see shots from McGeady and Naismith both miss the target. Gareth Barry was a lucky boy. He picked up a yellow card in the first half and then in the second half it was a blatant check and 99 times out of 100 the referee would get his yellow card out. When he did it I thought he was off, but Mike Jones wasn’t having any of it. Nigel Pearson didn’t have a care in the world and with the way his team performed last season and the way they performed today, there is every reason he should have that attitude. It was a good day all round. Matt Le Tissier But with the 45 minutes almost up, Naismith put the visitors back in front. Baines and Pienaar helped the ball in from the left and Naismith wrapped his left foot around it, sending a shot crashing in off the bar. Leicester needed to respond at the start of the second half and they did, with Riyad Mahrez's header forcing Everton into a hasty clearance. Ulloa should then have done better with a free header from Paul Konchesky's cross, but the clear-cut chance they were looking for came in the 65th minute. Unfortunately for Leicester, it fell for Schlupp, who had just come on as a substitute. Dean Hammond's through-ball was perfectly weighted, but Schlupp got his shot all wrong and it flew a long way over the bar. Mahrez was the next to try his luck, winning a free-kick 25 yards out for a trip by James McCarthy and then seeing it deflected just wide. Ulloa's debut ended when he was brought off to loud cheers in the 78th minute and replaced by Wood. Barry, who had picked up a soft booking for a foul on Ulloa, was a little fortunate to stay on the pitch when he pulled back the lively Mahrez. And it was Mahrez who set up the equaliser, jinking his way to the edge of the box before firing in a shot that hit Phil Jagielka and fell to Wood. It was no more than Leicester deserved for their attacking intent and, although Everton tried to respond, it was too late."},{"date": "16/08/2015", "arena": "Kiyan Prince Foundation Stadium",

QPR debut to forget as Hull City spoiled Rangers' return to the Premier League, coming away with a 1-0 win. MATCH FACTS Key moments from Hull City's 1-0 win at QPR MAN OF THE MATCH A close-run thing between James Chester and Curtis Davies but the Tigers skipper just shades it for a composed performance against a handful of a striker in Loic Remy. SAVE OF THE MATCH Charlie Austin's spot-kick wasn't the best but Allan McGregor did well to anticipate the direction of the penalty and get down to save. CHANCE OF THE MATCH Tom Ince had a great chance to wrap the game up for the Tigers after being fed well by substitute Stephen Quinn but he was denied by Rob Green. TALKING POINT Tale of two penalties. Chester seemed to be harshly penalised for hand ball while Hull had a good shout of their own when Jelavic was bundled over by Traore in the first half. Ferdinand – released by Manchester United in the summer – was out-muscled by James Chester at the far post, allowing the Tigers defender to head in Stephen Quinn’s 52nd minute corner for what proved the winner. But Hull had keeper Allan McGregor to thank for preserving the three points with the keeper saving Charlie Austin’s late penalty after Chester was harshly penalised for hand ball. Ferdinand had a chance himself to grab the equaliser moments before the spot-kick but his tame effort was hacked off the line by Tom Huddlestone. Harry Redknapp's side enjoyed the majority of possession during the contest but Rangers were ultimately made to pay the price for a lack of cutting edge in the final third. Instead, it was Chester who made the decisive contribution as he earned the Tigers their first win at Loftus Road since 1963. Loic Remy, who could have been wearing the red of Liverpool had he not failed a medical earlier this summer, was certainly the home side's greatest threat but Hull's well-organised defence did just enough to keep the Frenchman at bay. City enjoyed the better of the opening period, but the hosts established a foothold and were almost gifted a breakthrough when McGregor failed to shepherd the ball out of play for a goal-kick and Austin stole possession out wide. QPR had a lot of chances in the second half, but McGregor was fantastic – not just from the penalty. Hull looked very well organised. They look fit, strong and composed and don’t bother when they are under pressure a little bit. Chris Kamara on Soccer Saturday The striker could have tried a long-range shot into the open net but instead he teed up Jordon Mutch at the back post, who missed the ball completely on his weaker right foot. Remy, who was lacklustre early on, grew into the game and started causing Hull's back three problems with his direct running in behind. Just before the half-hour mark, the striker earned a free-kick on the edge of the area which Joey Barton clipped into the side-netting, and moments later he again broke free to find Mutch, who headed narrowly wide.

Steve Bruce has called for clarification on the handball rule after his side conceded a penalty in their 1-0 win over QPR. QPR continued to look the more likely scorers and almost broke the deadlock before half-time as Steven Caulker rose highest to a corner, but his header was cleared off the line by Andrew Robertson. The home side started the second half brightly but it was Hull who grabbed the opener in the 52nd minute when Chester out-muscled Ferdinand and headed home. QPR manager Harry Redknapp couldn't fault his side's performance in their 1-0 defeat to Hull. QPR manager Harry Redknapp couldn't fault his side's performance in their 1-0 defeat to Hull. Rangers responded positively to going behind but, for all their possession and forward-running, were unable to carve out a decisive chance. Instead, it was the visitors who should have doubled their lead when Tom Ince was put through on the counter-attack, but the 22-year-old's tame finish was blocked by the legs of Rob Green. Redknapp threw on Junior Hoilett, Bobby Zamora and Matt Phillips in the latter stages in search of an equaliser, and it was Hoilett who earned his side a spot-kick when his cross was adjudged to have struck the hand of Chester six minutes from time. Austin stepped up and fired low to McGregor's right but the Hull keeper read the shot and palmed the ball away. Zamora and Remy both had chances to equalise in the dying moments but the former took too long and the latter was denied by McGregor as Hull held on for all three points."},{"date": "16/08/2015",

Weimann’s second-half goal was enough to give Aston Villa a 1-0 win at the Britannia Stadium against a lacklustre Stoke City. Villa had the best opportunity of the first half after persistent play from Kieran Richardson gave Gabriel Agbonlahor the opportunity to score into an open goal from six yards out, but the striker could not apply the finish. Best of the Match Man of the match: Villa’s Fabian Delph was instrumental in midfield. He chased down every loose ball, while supplying the forward line with some excellent passes. An honorary mention to Villa’s dominant centre-back Philippe Senderos. Moment of the match: Mark Hughes’ decision to not change things around at half-time was crucial. Stoke had a lack of attacking impetus and substitutions were necessary to help swing the game in the Potters’ favour. Tackle of the match: Just when it looked like Marko Arnautovic was set to slot home a late equaliser, Senderos executed a superbly timed block to ensure that Paul Lambert’s side would leave Staffordshire with all three points. Charles N’Zogbia’s deflected effort almost made it past a sprawling Asmir Begovic, while Stoke’s Phil Bardsley tested Brad Guzan with a curling effort that the American could only parry away. With chances few and far between in the first half, it took just five second-half minutes for Villa to break the deadlock after Weimann drilled an effort past a stretching Begovic, who could only parry it into the net. Despite the inclusion of new signings Mame Diouf and Bojan Krkic, Stoke struggled in the final third while Villa defended resolutely to secure a hard-earned three points. Villa had not won away from home since January 1 and their six league games on the road previous to this had all ended in defeat in a poor conclusion to 2013/14. Stoke, on the other hand, had finished the campaign strongly, and lost only three times in the league at the Britannia Stadium over the whole season. Paul Lambert: Defenders were outstanding Paul Lambert: Defenders were outstanding There were three summer signings making their competitive debuts in each starting line-up, forward Bojan, Diouf and full-back Bardsley being the trio for Stoke, for whom newest arrival Victor Moses - whose loan move from Chelsea was confirmed earlier on Saturday - was not eligible to be involved. The Villa bows were for wide man Richardson and defensive pair Philippe Senderos and Aly Cissokho, joined at the back by Alan Hutton, making his first competitive appearance of manager Paul Lambert's tenure after two seasons of being frozen out. Winger N'Zogbia, having missed all of last term through injury, was also back in the first XI and striker Darren Bent - another previously exiled under Lambert - was among the substitutes. Asmir Begovic: We couldn't break Villa down Asmir Begovic: We couldn't break Villa down Stoke made a positive start to the contest, with Villa goalkeeper Guzan collecting a shot from Steven Nzonzi, seeing a Marko Arnautovic strike sail over and surviving a couple of hairy moments when Diouf tried to charge him down. Bojan looked eager to build on the good impression he made in pre-season by scoring three goals for his new club, and he created the clearest chance yet when he cut into the area and fired wide in the 13th minute. Villa had shown little attacking impetus, but they had a great chance to open the scoring in the 25th minute when Begovic and Stoke defender Marc Wilson got into a mix-up. Andi Weimann: Performance was 'brilliant' Andi Weimann: Performance was 'brilliant' The resultant loose ball was crossed into the danger zone by Richardson to Agbonlahor, who seemingly had the goal at his mercy but - perhaps put off by the presence of Ryan Shawcross - scuffed his shot wide. At the other end, Bardsley's low shot was parried by Guzan, with Bojan unable to follow up, before N'Zogbia cracked a fierce effort goalwards which had the sting taken out of it by a deflection. Minutes into the second half, the ball broke off Erik Pieters to Weimann, who took a poor first touch. But it came back to him via a combination of Wilson and Stephen Ireland, and the Austria international hit a shot which squeezed in off Begovic. Mark Hughes: Villa made it 'difficult' Mark Hughes: Villa made it 'difficult' Stoke sought an immediate response and Ron Vlaar did well to get in the way of a Bojan strike. Arnautovic arrowed a shot wide soon after but it was just not happening for the home side, and Villa might have added another goal in the 87th minute, Leandro Bacuna shooting well off-target when he really should have done better. Stoke fans held their breath in the dying seconds as Arnautovic turned and shot in the box, but Senderos was there with the block to ensure Villa held out for the win. CHARLIE NICHOLAS' VIEW: In the second part of the first half, Aston Villa were excellent and really started to dominate the game. It was more than deserved that they should score. There’s more experience now, the back four were excellent today and the shape was much better – but remember Aston Villa beat Arsenal at the Emirates at the same time last season and it was still an almighty struggle. Stoke did a bit better when Crouch came on, but other than that didn’t really create very much."},{"date": "16/08/2015", "arena": "The Hawthorns", "attendance": 25468, "home_team": {"name": "West Bromwich Albion", "lineup": [{"name": "Ben Foster", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andre Wisdom", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Craig Dawson", "yellows": [10], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonas Olsson", "yellows": [32], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sébastien Pocognoli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Graham Dorrans", "yellows": [30], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [84]}, {"name": "Craig Gardner", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [84]}, {"name": "Youssouf Mulumbu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Brunt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [77]}, {"name": "Saido Berahino", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Anichebe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Chris Baird", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [77], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Claudio Yacob", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [84], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Brown Ideye", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Boaz Myhill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jason Davidson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Liam O'Neil", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stéphane Sessegnon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [84], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Sunderland", "lineup": [{"name": "Vito Mannone", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wes Brown", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [81]}, {"name": "John O'Shea", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Valentin Roberge", "yellows": [42], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Patrick van Aanholt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lee Cattermole", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Johnson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [73]}, {"name": "Sebastian Larsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Rodwell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [68]}, {"name": "Connor Wickham", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Fletcher", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Costel Pantilimon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Liam Bridcutt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordi Gomez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [68], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jozy Altidore", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [81], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charis Mavrias", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Graham", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Will Buckley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [73], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Sebastian Larsson: Netted late equaliser for Sunderland Sebastian Larsson netted a late equaliser as West Bromwich Albion and Sunderland played out an entertaining 2-2 draw at The Hawthorns. Lee Cattermole broke the deadlock for Sunderland after just five minutes with a blistering strike into the top corner from 20 yards after West Brom defended a free-kick poorly. Best of the match Man of the match: Lee Cattermole. He opened the scoring with a fantastic goal and was typically strong in midfield for the rest of the match. Goal of the match: Cattermole’s strike after five minutes was spectacular as he left Ben Foster with no chance with a powerful effort from distance. Moment of the match: Neil Swarbrick’s decision to give West Brom a penalty late in the first half looked harsh as there was little contact from Valentin Roberge on Victor Anichebe. Talking point: Where do both sides need to strengthen before the transfer deadline? The hosts fought back and equalised three minutes before half-time courtesy of Saido Berahino’s penalty after Valentin Roberge was deemed to have fouled Victor Anichebe, although Sunderland were furious with referee Neil Swarbrick’s decision. Berahino then netted his second of the afternoon on 74 minutes to give West Brom the lead, slotting home Craig Gardner’s wonderful cross from close range. Alan Irvine was denied a win in his first game in charge, though, as Larsson turned in a Patrick van Aanholt cross to round off a flowing move five minutes from time and earn Sunderland a point. Irvine, who was paraded on the pitch to good applause prior to kick-off, fielded three of his eight new signings in former Sunderland man Gardner, Andre Wisdom and Sebastien Pocognoli. Record £10million buy Brown Ideye, not yet deemed match-fit, was left on the bench. Sunderland gave a start to their headline summer signing Jack Rodwell and also gave a debut to Van Aanholt. At first it seemed West Brom had settled the better, enjoying some good early possession, but it was Sunderland who showed the first flash of brilliance through Cattermole. The midfielder collected the ball 25 yards out from Jonas Olsson's headed clearance, steadied himself and unleashed a powerful shot into the top corner which Ben Foster could only get fingertips to. West Brom were not rocked by the setback and soon settled back into a rhythm which could bode well for the season. They pieced together some slick moves and utilised the holding-up ability of Anichebe well, although they were initially restricted to long-range efforts. Alan Irvine says West Brom were the better team in the first half Alan Irvine says West Brom were the better team in the first half Captain Chris Brunt went close with a good effort that curled narrowly wide and Pocognoli hit another crisp strike, although Vito Mannone was unconcerned as it drifted wide. Mannone looked more worried when Berahino found space, but lashed into the side-netting. Sunderland could have doubled their lead against the run of play when Larsson floated a free-kick into the box, but Roberge headed a clear-cut chance wide. The visitors were made to pay for the miss, although they could have a legitimate gripe over the penalty after Anichebe appeared to go down at the slightest hint of a shirt-pull from Roberge. Referee Swarbrick blew instantly, but stoked the tension by taking a few moments to indicate his decision. Gus Poyet expressed disappointment with the referee’s decision to award West Brom a penalty Gus Poyet expressed disappointment with the referee’s decision to award West Brom a penalty When given the go-ahead, Berahino made no mistake with a well-taken spot-kick. Sunderland lost their composure in the minutes that followed and Berahino benefited from some sloppy defending on a strong run, but Mannone got himself behind his shot. The visitors survived a scare early in the second half as Mannone flapped and Craig Dawson thought he had forced the ball over the line, but the flag was raised for a foul on the goalkeeper. Sunderland then started to show some spirit and created chances for Connor Wickham, who volleyed wide, and Steven Fletcher, whose header was ruled out for offside. It proved a short-lived flurry from Sunderland and the Baggies claimed the lead after 74 minutes. Saido Berahino says West Brom fought hard and didn't give up Saido Berahino says West Brom fought hard and didn't give up Mannone saved well from Graham Dorrans' long-range strike, but the ball stayed in play and Gardner was the quickest to react, quickly whipping in high cross to the far post. Sunderland were still back-tracking and Berahino got ahead of Van Aanholt to tap home his second, to the clear frustration of Mannone, who looked angry with the defence. Yet the visitors were not done and produced a move almost out of keeping with much of their earlier play five minutes from time. Jordi Gomez found Van Aanholt down the left and his cut-back was deftly diverted past Foster by Larsson from six yards out."},{"date": "16/08/2015", "arena": "Upton Park", "attendance": 34977, "home_team": {"name": "West Ham United", "lineup": [{"name": "Adrián", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joey O'Brien", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [62]}, {"name": "James Collins", "yellows": [54], "reds": [63], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Winston Reid", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Cresswell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mark Noble", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [30], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cheikhou Kouyaté", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stewart Downing", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin Nolan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ricardo Vaz Te", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [68]}, {"name": "Carlton Cole", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [81]}], "subs": [{"name": "Mauro Zárate", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Guy Demel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [62], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mohamed Diamé", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [68], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jussi Jaaskelainen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Diego Poyet", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Enner Valencia", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [81], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Reece Burke", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Tottenham Hotspur", "lineup": [{"name": "Hugo Lloris", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Naughton", "yellows": [], "reds": [29], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Younes Kaboul", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eric Dier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Rose", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nabil Bentaleb", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Etienne Capoue", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Eriksen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Erik Lamela", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [61]}, {"name": "Aaron Lennon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [61]}, {"name": "Emmanuel Adebayor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [83]}], "subs": [{"name": "Roberto Soldado", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lewis Holtby", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [61], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andros Townsend", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [61], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Kane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [83], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Dawson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Brad Friedel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Davies", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Debutant Eric Dier's stoppage-time goal gave Tottenham a 1-0 win at West Ham after both sides were reduced to 10 men in Saturday's Premier League opener. Spurs right-back Kyle Naughton received his marching orders just before the half-hour mark, when referee Chris Foy adjudged him to have prevented an obvious goalscoring opportunity when he handballed at close range from Kevin Nolan's shot on the turn. Best of the Match Man of the match: Eric Dier. An incredible debut for the 20-year-old, who moved to right-back from centre-back after Kyle Naughton’s dismissal and ended the game by racing through to coolly slot home the winner, having helped keep a clean sheet. Goal of the match: Spurs sub Harry Kane executed an inch-perfect through-ball for Dier to run onto, the defender staying onside and then showing a great touch to take the ball round Adrian and finish. Moment of the match: Spurs were stunned when referee Chris Foy waved a red card at Kyle Naughton just before the half-hour mark. There were few arguments about the penalty award from Nolan’s close-range shot on the turn, but the dismissal looked very harsh. Talking point: West Ham had 18 shots in the match but only managed to get four on target as the strike pairing of Carlton Cole and Ricardo Vaz Te failed to deliver. How long before Enner Valencia and Mauro Zarate are starting games? However, Mark Noble missed the resulting spot-kick, sending a low effort wide of Hugo Lloris' right-hand post. In the second half, Hammers centre-back James Collins was shown a second yellow card and then a red by Foy after blocking the run of Emmanuel Adebayor through the centre of the pitch. World Cup star Enner Valencia came off the bench for the final 10 minutes for West Ham, after Sam Allardyce's starting strike partnership of Carlton Cole and Ricardo Vaz Te had proved ineffective. In the closing stages, Nolan cleverly played in Stewart Downing but Spurs goalkeeper Lloris was quickly off his goal-line to make a crucial save. Then, in the third minute of stoppage time, debutant Dier burst through the Hammers defence onto Harry Kane's through-ball, rounded Adrian and slid home the winner to give Mauricio Pochettino three points in his first competitive game in charge of Tottenham. Pochettino handed club-record signing Erik Lamela just his fourth Premier League start. The 22-year-old Argentinian failed to make an impact in his first year at White Hart Lane but was given a chance to impress by Pochettino, along with Dier. Dier: Delighted with debut Dier: Delighted with debut There was no place in the starting line-up for Ben Davies, with Danny Rose preferred at left-back for the visitors, who were captained by Younes Kaboul. Left-back Aaron Cresswell and defensive midfielder Cheikhou Kouyate made their West Ham bows. During the summer Allardyce had been tasked with bringing a more entertaining brand of football to Upton Park and, up against Pochettino's supposedly free-flowing Spurs side, his team started the brighter. Midway through the half, Vaz Te miscued when a Collins flick-on found the Portuguese winger in plenty of space at the back post and shortly afterwards, Kouyate's diving header flew inches wide of Lloris' goal. With just under half an hour on the clock, the hosts were given the perfect opportunity to open the scoring when they were awarded a penalty for handball against Naughton. Pochettino delighted with win Pochettino delighted with win The full-back was arguably unlucky to be sent off for the misdemeanour but Noble could only drag the resulting spot-kick wide, with Lloris diving the wrong way. The Hammers remained the dominant force for the remainder of the half but could not find a way past Lloris, with Vaz Te flashing an effort wide as Allardyce's side continued to struggle in their quest to find the target. Tottenham came close to breaking the deadlock against the run of play as Lamela stole the ball off Noble and played in Aaron Lennon, who could only whip his shot over the bar. Cresswell: Hammers deserved more Cresswell: Hammers deserved more Vaz Te finally forced Lloris into a save, albeit a routine one, as he headed into the ground and straight into the hands of the France goalkeeper. After the break, it was Downing who stung the palms of Lloris, with Pochettino deciding to change things on the hour-mark as Andros Townsend and Lewis Holtby were introduced moments before the contest was evened up. Collins picked up his second yellow card as he stopped Adebayor in his tracks, with referee Foy having a busy first day of the new season. Allardyce left frustrated Allardyce left frustrated Christian Eriksen may have fluffed his lines from the free-kick that followed but Spurs were soon in the ascendancy for the first time in the game. Townsend forced Adrian into the best save of the match before seeing a similar effort deflected off target shortly afterwards. With both sides a body light, the game opened up as the half wore on - with Noble only able to shoot straight at Lloris after Kaboul had failed to bring the ball out of defence for the visitors. Allardyce brought on summer signing Valencia for a 10-minute cameo, with the Ecuador striker receiving a rapturous reception from the home fans. It was Downing, though, who came close to winning it late on for West Ham. The England winger exchanged neat passes with Nolan on the edge of the Spurs box before forcing his way through on goal, with Lloris doing well to close in and block Downing's shot. Phil Thompson's assessment Phil Thompson's assessment Adrian had to be lively at the opposing end to push out a long-range Nabil Bentaleb drive but the Spaniard could do nothing as Dier, a summer signing from Sporting Lisbon, kept his cool to send the travelling Spurs fans into delirium. Phil Thompson on Tottenham's 1-0 win at West Ham Being a defender, I wondered what Dier was doing up there in injury time! It’s 10 v 10 and there’s extra work for everybody - and there was the right-back, going right through the middle. I had to have a double take - but it was a fabulous finish for him. This was a slow burner of a game. I thought the handball for the penalty was too close to be given. James Collins couldn’t have any complaints over two yellow cards. Tottenham didn’t always play like a team last season, but early on everybody was closing down together. That’s one of the things the manager brought to Southampton and you saw the same in this - but there was no cutting edge to the side."},{"date": "16/08/2015", "arena": "Emirates Stadium",

Emirates Aaron Ramsey snatched a last-gasp winner for Arsenal as they came from behind to beat managerless Crystal Palace 2-1 at Emirates Stadium. Palace, under the caretaker guidance of Keith Millen following Tony Pulis’ shock departure, took the lead in an opening weekend derby date in north London through Brede Hangeland, but were pegged back before the interval by Laurent Koscielny. Watch the Saturday Night Football panel's analysis of Arsenal's 2-1 win over Palace Watch the Saturday Night Football panel's analysis of Arsenal's 2-1 win over Palace Millen’s side were then reduced to 10 men in the closing stages as Jason Puncheon was shown a second yellow card, and Arsenal made their numerical advantage count almost immediately as they pounced in stoppage-time. The opening two goals came from set-pieces, with defensive errors cancelling each other out. On 35 minutes, from a Puncheon corner, Hangeland was allowed to run away from Alexis Sanchez and Koscielny and glance past Wojciech Szczesny at the near post. Then, on the stroke of half-time, Hangeland returned the favour as he failed to pick up a run from Koscielny and was left to watch on helplessly as the Frenchman nodded a Sanchez free-kick into the bottom corner. Best of the match Man of the match: Aaron Ramsey. Kept going on a tough afternoon and got his reward with a dramatic late winner. Goal of the match: Ramsey has acquired a useful knack of being in the right place at the right time and he displayed predatory instincts to snatch all three points. Moment of the match: Palace were already tiring by the time they were reduced to 10 men and while Jason Puncheon cannot be blamed for what followed, his dismissal hardly helped. Talking point: Does grinding out a result bode well for Arsenal in their title quest? Who will Palace turn to as their next manager? Palace dug in from that point, but suffered a late blow as Puncheon slid in to catch Nacho Monreal on the ankle and was given his marching orders. Arsenal, who had been far from their free-flowing best, seized their opportunity in the dying seconds as Ramsey bundled home from close-range after an Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain cross had caused confusion inside the box and Mathieu Debuchy had seen an effort parried by Julian Speroni. Positive Arsenal made a positive start and Sanchez, signed from Barcelona over the summer, tried his luck when the ball broke to him some 25 yards out, but the Chilean's long-range chip over Speroni drifted well wide. The Palace goalkeeper then had to be alert on 29 minutes to get down quickly and push a low, curling 18-yard shot from Jack Wilshere behind. There was a rare moment of panic in the Arsenal rearguard when Szczesny's scuffed clearance was driven back towards goal from the halfway line by former Arsenal forward Marouane Chamakh. Koscielny was able to get across and block, before Fraizer Campbell's follow-up was put behind. From the corner, Palace took the lead on 35 minutes. Puncheon floated the corner in from the right, where Hangeland flicked it on at the near post into the far corner. Brede Hangeland: Broke the deadlock After being hit against the run of play, Arsenal needed to regroup quickly, and did so as Koscielny levelled just before half-time. Sanchez was fouled some 35 yards out, and floated a deep free-kick over the Palace defence. Koscielny ghosted behind the wall of yellow shirts and flicked the ball off the back of his neck into the corner. Wenger: A deserved win Wenger: A deserved win Arsenal were forced into a change just after the start of the second half when full-back Kieran Gibbs pulled up with what looked like a hamstring problem and was replaced by Monreal. Dangerous Palace continued to prove difficult to break down, which had been a trademark of Pulis' reign, but also looked dangerous on the counter. On the hour mark, Yaya Sanogo was replaced by Olivier Giroud, the France international having come off the bench at Wembley last weekend to crack home a superb third goal in the Community Shield win over Manchester City. Laurent Koscielny: Hauled Arsenal level Arsenal appealed for a penalty when the ball bounced onto Chamakh's arm and chest, but the referee was unmoved. Chamakh, who had committed a string of fouls all afternoon, was then finally shown a yellow card for clattering into Wilshere on the halfway line. The midfielder was soon replaced, perhaps as a precaution, by England team-mate Oxlade-Chamberlain with 20 minutes left. Millen: Set-pieces cost us Millen: Set-pieces cost us Arsenal had another penalty claim turned away by referee Jonathan Moss when Giroud looked to have been pulled down by Hangeland as the ball was swung in from Sanchez. Giroud flashed an angled drive across the face of goal before, with two minutes left, Puncheon was sent off for a second caution after a late challenge on Monreal. Arsenal continued to press and were rewarded in the closing moments. Giroud's knockdown was fired goalwards by Debuchy and although Speroni produced a fine reaction stop at point-blank range, Ramsey was alert to smash in the rebound and send the Emirates Stadium faithful into wild celebration."}]
